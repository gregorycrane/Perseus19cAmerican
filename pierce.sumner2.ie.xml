<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>The house is Elizabethan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Here I have been enjoying fox-hunting, to the imminent danger of my limbs and neck; that they still remain intact is a miracle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>His Lordship's hounds are among the finest in the kingdom, and his huntsman is reputed the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>There are about <num value="80">eighty</num> couples; the expense of keeping them is about <measure n="5000l." type="pounds"><num value="5000">five thousand</num> pounds</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>In his stables there are some <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> hunters that are only used with the hounds, and of course are unemployed during the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>The exertion of a day's sport is so great that a horse does not go out more than once in a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>I think I have never participated in any thing more exciting than this exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The history of my exploits will confirm this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>The morning after my arrival I mounted, at <time value="9:30oclock">half-past 9 o'clock</time>, a beautiful hunter, and rode with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Milton</foreName></persName> about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> to the place of meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>There were the hounds and huntsmen and whippers-in, and about <num value="80">eighty</num> horsemen,&mdash;the noblemen and gentry and clergy of the neighborhood, all beautifully mounted, and the greater part in red coats, leather breeches, and white top-boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>The hounds were sent into the cover, and it was a grand sight to see so many handsome dogs, all of a size, and all washed before coming out, rushing into the underwood to start the fox. We were unfortunate in not getting a scent immediately, and rode from cover to cover; but soon the cry was raised <q direct="unspecified">Tally-ho!</q>&mdash;the horn was blown&mdash;the dogs barked&mdash;the horsemen rallied&mdash;the hounds scented their way through the cover on the trail of the fox, and then started in full run. I had originally intended only to ride to cover to see them throw off, and then make my <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> way home, believing myself unequal to the probable run; but the chase commenced, and I was in the midst of it; and, being excellently mounted, nearly at the head of it. Never did I see such a scamper; and never did it enter into my head that horses could be pushed to such speed in such places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>We dashed through and over bushes, leaping broad ditches, splashing in brooks and mud, and passing over fences as so many imaginary lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fence I shall not readily forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>I was near <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Milton</foreName></persName>, who was mounted on a thoroughbred horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>He cleared a fence before him. My horse pawed the ground and neighed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>I gave him the rein, and he cleared the fence: as I was up in the air for <num value="1">one</num> moment, how was I startled to look down and see that there was not only a fence but a <hi rend="italics">ditch</hi>! He cleared the ditch too. I have said it was my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>I lost my balance, was thrown to the very ears of the horse, but in some way or other contrived to work myself back to the saddle without touching the ground (<hi rend="italics">vide</hi> some of the hunting pictures of leaps, &amp;c.). How I got back I cannot tell; but I did regain my seat, and my horse was at a run in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>All this, you will understand, passed in less time by far than it will take to read this account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/><num value="1">One</num> moment we were in a scamper through a ploughed field, another over a beautiful pasture, and another winding through the devious paths of a wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>I think I may say that in no single day of my life did I ever take so much exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>I have said that I mounted at <time value="9">nine</time> and <time value="0.5oclock">a half o'clock</time>. It wanted <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> of <num value="5">five</num> when I finally dismounted, not having been out of the saddle more than <measure n="30seconds" type="date">thirty seconds</measure> during all this time, and then only to change my horse, taking a fresh <num value="1">one</num> from a groom who was in attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>During much of this time we were on a full run.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The next day had its incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>The place of meeting for the hounds was about <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> from the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Our horses were previously led thither by grooms, and we rode there in a carriage and <num value="4">four</num>, with outriders, and took our horses fresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>This day I met with a fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The country was very rough, and the fences often quite stiff and high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>I rode among the foremost, and in going over a fence and a brook together, came to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>My horse cleared them both; and I cleared him, for I went directly over his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Of course he started off, but was soon caught by <persName n="Milton,,,,," id="n0207.0005.00032.00563" reg="mostcommon:Milton,John,,,:2"><surname>Milton</surname></persName> and a parson, who had already made the leap successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>I should not fail to commemorate the feats of the clergymen, as they illustrate the position of this body in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>The best and hardest rider in this part of the country is reputed to be a clergyman; and there was not a day that I was out that I did not see <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> persons rejoicing in the style of <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Reverend</rs>,</q> and distinguishable from the rest of the <hi rend="italics">habitues by</hi> wearing a black instead of a red coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>They were among the foremost in every field, and cleared fences with great ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Once we came to a very stiff rail fence; and, as the hounds were not in full cry, there was a general stop to see how the different horses and riders would take it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>They mingled in all the light conversation of the field,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of them told a story which I would not venture to trust to this sheet,&mdash;and they were addressed by all with the utmost familiarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Indeed, sportsmen rather wish a rain, because it makes the ground soft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Dinner was early, because the sportsmen returned fatigued, and without having tasted a morsel of food since an early breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>So, after our return, we only had time to dress; and at <time value="5">five</time> and <time value="0.5oclock">a half o'clock</time> assembled in the library, from which we went in to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/>I agree with you entirely with regard to the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Creola, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2079141">Creole</placeName></q> affair,&mdash;except, perhaps, that I go further than you do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/>In the first place, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> cannot deliver up the slaves who are not implicated in the mutiny and murder by which the government of the ship was overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4514"/>She has laid down a rule not to recognize property in human beings since the date of her great Emancipation Act. The principle of this is very clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4515"/>She will not in any way lend her machinery of justice to execute foreign laws which she has pronounced immoral, unchristian, and unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4516"/>She had not so pronounced until her Act of Emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4517"/>It is common learning among jurists, that no nation will enforce contracts or obligations of an immoral character, even though not regarded as immoral in the country where they were entered into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4518"/>Thus, in <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName>, the wages of prostitution may be recoverable in the courts, or a contract of concubinage may be enforced (I merely put these cases, without absolute knowledge that such could arise); but the courts of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and&mdash;thank God!&mdash;of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, would peremptorily decline to recognize the validity of any promise or contract arising from such impurities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4519"/>So must it be now with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>To her, slavery is worse than polygamy and concubinage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>She cannot be called upon in any way to acknowledge the legal existence of a relation which she has denounced as a crime <hi rend="italics">majoris abollo</hi>;.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>Next, as to the slaves, participators in the mutiny and murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>Their case is not so clear as that of the others; but, nevertheless, sufficiently clear <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> to enable us to see the way of settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>And, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I am inclined to believe&mdash;indeed, I entertain scarcely any doubt&mdash;that they became <hi rend="italics">free men</hi>when taken, by the voluntary act of their owners, beyond the jurisdiction of the <rs>Slave States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>Slavery is not a national institution; nor is it <num value="1">one</num> recognized by the law of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/>It is peculiar to certain States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>It draws its vitality from the legislation of those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>Now, this legislation is of course limited to those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>It is not extra-territorial in its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/>Our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> courts have decided that a slave coming to our soil by the consent of his master&mdash;as, for instance, a servant&mdash;becomes entitled to his freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>The invigorating principle of the common law manumits him. It is not so, however, with a fugitive slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>And why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>Because the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> has provided for his surrender; but the case of a fugitive slave is the only <num value="1">one</num> provided for. The courtier of <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Elizabeth</foreName></persName> said that the air of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was too pure for a slave to breathe in. I will say that the air of the ocean is too pure for slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>There is the principle of manumission in its strong breezes,&mdash;at least, when the slave is carried there by the voluntary act of his owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>If I am correct in this view, these slaves were remitted to their natural rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>They were justified in overthrowing by force (not mutinous or murderous, because justifiable) any power which deprived them of their liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>In doing what they did, therefore, they have not been guilty of any crime: they are in the same situation with the others who did not participate in the alleged murder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>But, in the next place, suppose we are wrong in this view; suppose they were not justified in rising, as they did; suppose, in short, that they have committed the crime of murder under our laws,&mdash;still, I say, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will not be obliged to give them up. The crime will be piracy by statute, and not by the law of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>Now, it is perfectly clear by the law of nations,&mdash;and no nation has acted upon this rule more than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,&mdash;that no government can be called upon to surrender persons who have offended against the municipal laws of another government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>It is, of course, within the discretion of a government to surrender such offenders; but it is no just cause of complaint that a government refuses to exercise this discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>There can be no doubt that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will refuse to exercise it. Believe me, my dear sir,</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>I know something of the conduct of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in regard to the slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>This world is full of harshness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>It is easier to censure than to praise: the former is a gratification of our self-esteem; while to praise seems, with minds too ambitious and ungenerous, a tacit admission of superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>It is a bane of society, wherever I have known it,&mdash;and here in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> as much as in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>,&mdash;a perpetual seeking for something which will disparage or make ridiculous our neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>Their conduct is canvassed, and mean and selfish motives are attributed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>Their foibles are dragged into day. I do not boast myself to be free from blame on this account; and yet I try to find what is good and beautiful in all that I see, and to judge my fellow-creatures as I would have them judge me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>Not that I did not see much misery, much coarseness, much ignorance, much want of refinement, much injustice; but <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> among individuals of all countries I found precious human sympathies, and cultivation that adorned them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>You think I look back upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with too warm feelings of regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5396"/>The true issue, he contends, was not their actual guilt, but their guilt as apparent at the time; not the actual necessity, with the light of subsequent knowledge, but the necessity as it then seemed to the commander, acting conscientiously, and upon reasonable apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5399"/>But in giving this effect to the motives of the commander, we assume that the mutiny had acquired such foothold as to cause reasonable and well-grounded apprehensions for the safety of the ship; in other words, there must have been an apparent necessity for a resort to extraordinary means to arrest the mutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5740"/>There was a great deal of law business done in the building; there was great familiarity among the different lawyers: cases that were under investigation and legal points that came up were freely discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5741"/><persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0207.0028.00251.03724" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> was very popular in all the offices; he was fresh from his studies in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, full of enthusiasm, conversant with all the various editions of legal treatises, new and old; full of curious information, too, in regard to distinguished lawyers and judges; always ready to lend a hand in any case involving knotty points; always welcome in every room in the building, while his <pb id="p.252" n="252"/> own office seemed a common resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5742"/>His genial temper, his courteous affability were peculiarly attractive to young men who were entering upon the profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5743"/>There seemed to be no question for which he had not a ready answer, no point upon which he could not throw light, no difficulty upon which he could not make valuable suggestions; while his thorough mastery of legal principles, his great knowledge of the text-books, his familiarity with the reports, ancient and modern, and his wide knowledge of lawyers and judges, extending into the minutest details of their history and characteristics, rendered him a most interesting and valuable companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5744"/>His reading upon every topic connected with law had been really very extensive, while his investigation into recondite and minute points was also very thorough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5745"/>His memory, too, was prodigious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5746"/>He always seemed to talk with a full mind upon every thing connected with our profession, inspiring his juniors with something of his own enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5747"/>Before he went abroad, he was doing a respectable business, and, I think, gave good attention to his work; ready to take up any labor that came to him, and desirous of becoming a thorough practitioner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5748"/>He told me with some glee, <num value="1">one</num> day, that he wrote a love-letter for a man who had come to him in distress, making it so tender in expression as to draw tears from his client, who was not before aware how deeply his affections were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5749"/>I do not think that he did much of any business in the courts before he went abroad; nor do I suppose him to have been an adept in the minutiae of practice or in conducting trivial cases in the various tribunals; but I believe he was ready and desirous to enter upon any honorable labor connected with the profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5750"/>When he went abroad, the opinion was pretty generally expressed that it would do him no good in a professional point of view; and this, to some extent, turned out to be so. Although he returned with a professed determination to confine himself to legal pursuits, it is probably true that his brilliant career, his extensive acquaintance, his large literary and personal correspondence, considerably impeded his progress as a lawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5751"/>He would have been glad to succeed <persName n="Peters,Mister,,,," id="n0207.0028.00252.03725" reg="mostcommon:Peters,Richard,,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Peters</surname></persName> as Reporter of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5752"/>His time was considerably occupied by literary pursuits; his office was a constant resort of literary men; he read a great deal of the current literature of the day, and was often in the library of the <name>Athemaeum</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5753"/>He became a frequent and most valuable contributor to the <quote>Law Reporter,</quote> of which I was the editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5754"/>Some of his more important contributions contained, as I think, his best thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>He did not care to discuss abstract questions, or to theorize in a heavy way upon points that might never arise; he chose rather to speak of men, judges, lawyers, and writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>He was an admirable critic of books; his contributions were light, airy, and fanciful, sometimes perhaps superficial: they were usually apposite, full of learning, and very interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5757"/>Nothing delighted him more than to write upon curious matters, throwing a flood of learning upon difficult points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/>Sometimes he really <quote>ran a muck,</quote> and astonished staid and respectable lawyers who looked over the pages of the magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>Thus, in <dateStruct value="1841-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>, he undertook to write a leading article on the law magazines <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and finding that the number was <hi rend="italics"><num value="7">seven</num></hi>, he had more than a dozen pages upon the term <quote><num value="7">seven</num>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/><quote>The <num value="7">number seven</num>,</quote> he said, <quote>is an important and mysterious figure, playing distinguished parts in the world's history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5761"/>Like the well-graced actor, it appears, reappears, and appears again on the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5762"/>It shows itself solemnly in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> creation of the universe: <q direct="unspecified">in <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> the <rs>Lord</rs> made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the <hi rend="italics"><num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num></hi> day; wherefore the <rs>Lord</rs> blessed the <name>Sabbath</name> day and hallowed it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5763"/>And <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure> have ever since filled the division of time called a week.

<p>It happened that these remarks on <quote>The <num value="7">number seven</num></quote> occupied all the space that could be devoted to the subject of the article in a single number of the magazine; it also happened that arrangements had been made to publish an article by <persName n="Fletcher,Judge,,,," id="n0207.0028.00253.03739" reg="mostcommon:Fletcher,Richard,,,:5"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Fletcher</surname></persName>, so that it was <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> before the conclusion of <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0207.0028.00253.03740" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s essay could appear, which was headed <quote>American Law journals.</quote>

<p>It would be impossible to describe the astonishment of some of the readers of the <quote>Law Reporter,</quote> at the appearance of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article, which, standing by itself, was certainly a curious discussion for a law magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>The editor was fully aware of this, and so wrote to <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0207.0028.00253.03742" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>But it was extremely difficult to make him change any thing he had once written.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/></p> 
<p>His critical notices of new books were generally very good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>Here his extensive reading served an excellent purpose; and he was perfectly fearless and independent in the expression of opinions, and unsparing in his condemnation of poor books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>He sometimes expressed his condemnation in a mode obvious enough to general readers, but so worded as to deceive the author himself, by throwing in some general notes of praise,&mdash;especially if the author were a friend of his own. The skilful manner in which he did this was something marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>The editor once hinted this to him in a note, and quoted those lines of <persName n="Cowley,,,,," id="n0207.0028.00253.03743" reg="mostcommon:Cowley,nomatch:0"><surname>Cowley</surname></persName>,&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/></p> 
<p>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he so terribly cut up the work of a poor devil of an author, that he came on here all the way from New York with the intention of challenging the editor, who happened fortunately to be out of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>The author fumed round a few days and then went home, leaving a letter to the editor full of violence and wrath, and evincing the extent of his legal attainments by the assertion that he intended to prosecute the editor, a citizen of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, in the <orgName n="Circuit Court" type="court">Circuit Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, sitting in New York!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/></p> 
<p>All these things&mdash;this writing for the <quote>Law Reporter</quote> and for the newspapers and magazines&ndash;were mere diversions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>In point of fact, he kept steadily in view the profession of his choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>He was fully determined to be a great lawyer; he held himself ready for practice; he took depositions, acted as master in chancery and commissioner, and avoided nothing that came to him in the line of his professional duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>No man could more truthfully say,&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>No doubt he found the professional life rather irksome; no doubt, after his remarkable career abroad, it seemed somewhat dull to settle down at <address><street n="Court Street 4">No. 4 Court Street</street></address>; no doubt he had less zeal and enthusiasm than when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came to the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>But still, I believe that he would have become a great lawyer or a great judge, had he not been called to a different stage of action, where his whole time and attention were absorbed in the consideration of great questions, and in the defence of principles which lie at the foundation of civil liberty.</p>

<p><persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0207.0028.00254.03745" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s entrance upon the political arena, and particularly his election as <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, broke the harmony of <address><street n="Court Street 4">No. 4 Court Street</street></address>, although the relations of personal friendship continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/></p> 
<p>In closing these desultory observations, and in view of my early and intimate friendship with this distinguished man, I desire to say that I never heard him utter a mean sentiment, or use a vulgar expression, or make a suggestion in regard to any act that was not in accordance with the strictest principles of honor and integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>He was a gentleman in the best sense of the term,&mdash;courteous in manner; dignified in bearing; firm in the expression of his opinions, but gentle in his intercourse with those who differed from him, although he was sometimes so earnest and persistent in what was regarded as extreme views as seriously to annoy his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>But with all his kindly ways he would never submit to any discourtesy from others, and required that they should observe the rules which he rigidly adhered to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>I remember his deliberately refusing the hand of <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest members of the bar, who had reported his private conversation under circumstances involving a breach of confidence; and he continued the nonintercourse <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> until the offender, who was quite unused to making apologies, had given a full explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>He always maintained that simple truth was the only shield a man should wear, denounced with the greatest scorn every thing that related to trickery or underhanded dealing, and always denied that any success was worthy of the name which was not the result of the highest principles</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7274"/>my dear <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>,&mdash;You were perhaps prepared, by the beautiful adieu of our dear <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, which was speeded to you by the last packet, for the sad tidings of her death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7275"/>Before her few words could have reached you, we placed her mortal remains in the tomb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7276"/>She died at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the morning of <dateStruct value="-10-11"><day type="name">Friday</day>, <month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg="11">11</day></dateStruct>, and was buried on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, <dateStruct value="-10-13"><month reg="10">Oct.</month> <day reg="13">13</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7277"/>A few days before her death, she expressed a wish that <persName n="Gannett,Mister,,,," id="n0207.0031.00321.04582" reg="mostcommon:Gannett,E.,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gannett</surname></persName> should read at her funeral the service of our church,&mdash;adding to this whatever his own judgment or feelings might suggest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7278"/>In the performance of this wish, I asked his kind presence and prayers on that occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7279"/>In the touching and beautiful prayer which he offered there was an allusion to <q direct="unspecified">the brother who, in the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, had been separated for many years from the beloved sister,</q> and a hope <q direct="unspecified">that he might be strengthened to bear this sorrow with resignation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7280"/></p> 
<p>I was recalled from <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName>, where I was passing my time in exercise in the open air, by the tidings of the progress of <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>'s disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7281"/>I found her weak, very weak,&mdash;almost voiceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7282"/>Her beautiful countenance was sunken; and the sharp angles of death had appeared even before the breath had departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7283"/>She still lingered on, however,&mdash;sometimes in considerable pain,&mdash; and we feared with each protracted day new suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7284"/>She herself wished to die; and I believe that we all became anxious at last that the <name>Angel</name> should descend to bear her aloft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7285"/>From the beautiful flower of her life the leaves had all gently fallen to the earth; and there remained but little for tile hand <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> of Death to pluck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7286"/>During the night preceding the morning on which she left us, she slept like a child; and within a short time of her death, when asked if she were in pain, she said: <q direct="unspecified">No: angels are taking care of me!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7287"/></p> 
<p>You, my dear <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>, do not know the beauty and loveliness of the dear sister you have lost; for she was a child when you left home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7288"/>Her features were regular and classical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7289"/>I have often thought that she resembled the heads of <persName n="Minerva,,,,," id="n0207.0031.00322.04583" reg="mostcommon:Minerva,nomatch:0"><surname>Minerva</surname></persName>; but she was truly feminine in her expression and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7290"/>In mien and bearing there was a rare blending of dignity and modesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7291"/>But better far than beauty of person was the character which shone transparent in the countenance, and the conscience which sat ruler of all thoughts and acts. . . .</p>

<p>And now, if it be asked why, on this National Anniversary, in the consideration of the true grandeur of nations, I have thus dwelt singly and exclusively on war, it is because war is utterly and irreconcilably inconsistent with true greatness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8228"/><num value="1">1</num>. You believe in the law of <hi rend="italics">force</hi>. I believe that the age has passed for physical force between nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8229"/>My chief argument stands on the parallel between war and the trial by battle; and I wish to urge upon nations that they are now governed by the same rules of barbarous force which once prevailed between individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8230"/>You say that you should be unwilling to rely upon simple abstract justice without force to back it. But you do in your own house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8231"/>Your house has not loop-holes, or a draw-bridge, or a moat, as the houses of the dark ages had. You rely upon the honesty and peacefulness of your neighbors, and the protecting power of the law. So nations should rely upon their neighbors, and should learn to refer questions to Arbitration or to a Congress of Nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8232"/><num value="2">2</num>. As to the safety of private ships in the harbor, and merchandise in the warehouses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8233"/>Clearly, even under the present laws of war, they would be safe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8234"/><num value="3">3</num>. You think it would not be safe to leave our harbors unprotected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8235"/>O you of little faith!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8236"/>Who would attack them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8237"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8238"/>Neither of these would think of a <hi rend="italics">conquest</hi>. No war can arise between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and either of these nations except to determine some asserted right; and an arbitration would be the proper mode of determining this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8239"/><num value="4">4</num>. You say <q direct="unspecified">occupation is necessary for men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8240"/>So I say; but let them be occupied productively, not uselessly, living actually at the cost of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8241"/>Let them be put to till the earth, or to watch a cotton mill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8242"/>I consider your neighbor, the gun-maker, an unproductive consumer of the fruits of the earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8243"/><num value="5">5</num>. <q direct="unspecified">Would not the mass of unemployed wretchedness in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> be increased if the army and navy were turned loose to seek a support by labor?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8244"/>Clearly not; because it is the support of the army and navy that now causes such wretchedness: the taxation is chiefly on account of war and preparation for war; the poverty and wretchedness are the brood of war. Imagine the wealth now absorbed in preparation for war devoted to opening new sources of employment, bringing forward new materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8245"/>But your sagacity in political economy will readily comprehend the effect of this beyond any illustration of mine.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8256"/>For years I have entertained the convictions which I expressed on the <rs>National Anniversary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8257"/>I consider that the age of physical force has passed, and that the weapons of revolution and of liberty are moral, not physical; that the happiness of nations would be best promoted by adopting those relations with each other that now prevail between individuals; that fortifications and armies and all military preparations show that nations still preserve the barbarous habits which we condemn in the dress, and armor, and castles of the <rs>Middle Ages</rs>; that war is an ordeal by battle, impious and monstrous as that of the <rs>Middle Ages</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8258"/>These convictions are bound up with my whole nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8259"/>All who know any thing of me know that I have entertained them for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8262"/>On this common ground we may be fellow-laborers in <num value="1">one</num> cause, which I am anxious to commend to our country,&mdash;the duty of taking immediate steps, by negotiation or otherwise, to induce the nations to adopt a system of Arbitration, or a Congress of Nations, and determine peacefully disputes between nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8266"/>I value your kindness more than I can tell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8267"/>The subject you open is vast,&mdash;beyond me. I have only sported on its brink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8268"/>It seems to me that it is most successfully treated by <persName n="Dymond,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00377.04998" reg="mostcommon:Dymond,nomatch:0"><surname>Dymond</surname></persName>, whose view of the duties of Christians is admirable for its clearness and benevolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8269"/>I distinguish between war and any force in the course of justice in this way: War is a trial by battle; it is monstrous and impious, as the latter was called, because it is a deliberate appeal to <hi rend="italics">force</hi> or <hi rend="italics">chance</hi> to determine an asserted right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8270"/>I do not see in it any element of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8271"/>We hear of <hi rend="italics">defensive</hi> wars; but I denounce the phrase and the idea as false,&mdash;at least in our age, and with reference to our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8272"/>What is the feud with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, but a question as to the title to a piece of land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8273"/>Now, this clearly should be tried, as other titles are tried, by arbitration, or by some tribunal having in it the elements of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8274"/>But a riot or other crime puts in jeopardy men, wives, children, society, and awakens the right of <hi rend="italics">self-defence</hi>. I am not entirely satisfied that this distinction accords with the true spirit of the <name>Gospel</name>; it does not seem to be in harmony with the views of <persName n="Dymond,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00377.04999" reg="mostcommon:Dymond,nomatch:0"><surname>Dymond</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8275"/>Still, it seems to me sufficiently clear; and I am for the present contented, if it will allow me to brand war as barbarous and unchristian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8276"/>It seems to me that there is a cause which will commend itself to you: I mean the effort to induce our country to make it a part of its fundamental policy to urge diplomatically upon the other <name>Christian</name> nations the formal establishment of a system of Arbitration, or a Congress of Nations, that shall supersede the arbitrament of war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8342"/>Civilized nations carry on wars, maintain standing armies, and spend vast sums on forts and navies; but they are not met, a <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, with an array of peace societies, journals, tracts, anniversaries, and sermons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8343"/><num value="1">One</num> reason may be suggested for this reaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8344"/>Moralists and philanthropists did not then foresee that war, which had long served ambition, was destined to render service for the human race which no other agency seemed able to render.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8345"/>They did not foresee how the unity and independence of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> were yet to be wrested from her oppressors; how a usurper was to be driven from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>; how American Slavery, which defied moral efforts, was to perish,&mdash;each by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8347"/> 
<p>The change of opinion among divines and moralists is well shown by comparing the editions of <placeName key="tgn,2050839" n="1.000 19" reg="wayland, middlesex county, massachusetts">Wayland</placeName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Moral Science.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8348"/>In all but the last there is a chapter earnestly setting forth the moral and religious argument against war, and coming to the conclusion that <q direct="unspecified">hence it would seem that all wars are contrary to the revealed will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and that the individual has no right to commit to society, nor society to commit to government, the power to declare war.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8349"/>But in the last edition, published in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, just after the suppression of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, and completed <num value="1">one</num> month preceding his death, the author substituted a much briefer discussion of the question; and maintained, contrary to the view his treatise had taught for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, the duty, in extreme cases of national aggression, to repel force by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8350"/>It is worthy of note, in this connection, that formerly greater prominence was given, in discussions concerning the taking of human life judicially or in war, to certain texts of Scripture than is common at this day, when the argument is put rather on the general spirit and scheme of Christianity and considerations of public necessity.</p></note> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8382"/>For a considerable time it was the frequent topic of society, as well as of the public journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8383"/>No American tract or address has probably ever had so wide a circulation in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8385"/>It touched the hearts of <name>Christian</name> people, whether accepting or holding back from its logical statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8386"/>Its style, less academic than <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00383.05025" reg="mostcommon:Everett,Edward,,,:12"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>'s, less weighty than <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00383.05026" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Fletcher,,,:3"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s, glowed as theirs never glowed with moral enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8387"/>It was a new order of eloquence, at least for civic occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8388"/>Something of its effect doubtless came from the condition of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8389"/>The spirit of Slavery dominated in politics, backed by conservatism in society; and a war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, to be waged for its extension, was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8390"/>Men who heard the new orator saw in the intrepidity he showed on that occasion that there was no advanced post in any field of moral heroism which he was not brave enough to assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8391"/>His character was revealed to men of different types.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8392"/>Reformers were made glad as they saw him&mdash;a fresh and well-armored knight&mdash;enter the arena where they were contending against numbers and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8393"/>But from that day his hold was weakened on the class then controlling society and opinion in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>,&mdash;the class always faithful to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00383.05027" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Fletcher,,,:3"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00383.05028" reg="mostcommon:Everett,Edward,,,:12"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Winthrop,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00383.05029" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,Robert,C.,,:4"><surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8394"/>His personal qualities still insured him a kindly reception as a guest, but his fidelity to the interests then uppermost was henceforth distrusted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8395"/>The oration on <q direct="unspecified">The True Grandeur of Nations</q> was the most important epoch in <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0207.0033.00383.05030" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8396"/>All he had written before was in the style of the essay,&mdash;ornate and vigorous in expression, but wanting the declamatory force and glow of passion by which the masses of men are swayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8399"/>Though loved by companions, a familiar presence at <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, recognized in his profession as learned in its books and as a writer for law magazines, he had no fame outside of these limited circles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8401"/>Beyond his native city and its suburbs, he was little known except among scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8402"/>He had kept aloof from politics, and even from the public agitation of questions in which he was most interested, and had uniformly declined to speak before lyceums or at academic festivals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8403"/>Not regarding the mere record of his name as an attorney in the court calendar, the newspapers had printed it hardly a dozen times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8404"/>Had he died before this event, his memory would have been only a tradition with the few early friends who survive him. The <dateStruct value="1845-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1845</year>,</dateStruct>&mdash;a day ever memorable with him,&mdash;gave him a national, and more than a national, fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8405"/>Such abrupt transitions may be expected in military life, but they rarely occur in civil history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8406"/>When that occasion was ended, he had demonstrated his moral fearlessness, his capacity to deal with great issues, his gift of inspiring eloquence; and he took his place in the front rank of orators, which he held while he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8407"/>Fortunate in his opportunity, he was fortunate also in the people who were often to listen to his voice,&mdash;a people among whom the moral sentiments have always been potent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8408"/>The gloom, which for many months had vexed his spirit, vanished as he wielded the new-found faculty in the service of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8409"/>Student though he was to the last, he now went forth from the seclusion of a scholar's chamber well trained by self-discipline, and strong in purpose and hope, to enter on the work which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had appointed him to do.
