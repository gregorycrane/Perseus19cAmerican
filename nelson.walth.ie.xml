<p><emph>T</emph>HIS sketch of <placeName reg="Waltham, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014579">Waltham</placeName> has reached nearly double the number of pages originally intended, and yet many matters of interest have not even been mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>So rich is the supply of material that a volume <num value="4">four</num> times as large could easily have been filled with the valuable historical records that have been preserved since its incorporation, while further diligent and careful research would doubtless throw much light upon its settlement and growth during the <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> preceding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The Puritan visitors, who made their simple exchange of a bisket-cake for a bass with the native fishermen of the <name>Mishaum</name> on that balmy summer's morning <measure n="2.5centuries" type="date">two and a half centuries</measure> ago, little dreamed that before that period should elapse upon either bank of the same river would arise industries that should revolutionize the trade of the world, or they would have remained and identified themselves with a spot destined to become so famous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The chief aim in making this compilation has been to condense within the limits of a popular sketch such facts as were thought to be of the most importance in the history of the town from this early date (<dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct>), and to present them in such form as would attract and interest the general reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>If this end has been attained; if by the perusal of these pages readers are led to feel a deeper interest in the deeds and records of <q direct="unspecified">the fathers,</q> not only of the town but of the state and nation as well; if the <q direct="unspecified">sun-pictures</q> of its manufactories, its churches and school-houses, its private residences, and its natural scenery attract the attention of those heretofore strangers to its marvellous beauty and to the enterprise of its people, and if an interest be aroused that shall call for a full and complete history from competent hands, this book will not have been written in vain.</p>
