<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>in giving to the world this Autobiography of my husband's early years, I am carrying out his wishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Unfortunately, the <name>Autobiography</name> was left unfinished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>I am, however, able to give very full extracts from his journals, letters, and private note-books, in which, day by day, he jotted down observations and reflections.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>My best introduction is the following passage from a letter he wrote to me on <dateStruct value="1893-11-30"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1893">1893</year></dateStruct>:--<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/></p> 
<p>I should like to write out a rough draft, as it were, of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The polishing could take care of itself, or you could do it, when the time comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Were I suddenly to be called away, how little, after all, the world would know of me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>My <placeName>African</placeName> life has been fairly described, but only as it affected those whom I served, or those who might be concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The inner existence, the <hi rend="italics">me</hi>, what does anybody know of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>nay, you may well ask, what do I know?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But, granted that I know little of my real self, still, I am the best evidence for myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>And though, when I have quitted this world, it will matter nothing to me what people say of me, up to the moment of death we should strive to leave behind us something which can either comfort, amuse, instruct, or benefit the living; and though I cannot do either, except in a small degree, even that little should be given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Just endeavour to imagine yourself in personal view of all the poor boys in these islands, <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, Scotch, <persName n="Welsh,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Welsh,nomatch:0"><surname>Welsh</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName>, and also all the poor boys in <placeName>Canada</placeName>, the <name>States</name>, and our Colonies; regarding them as we regard those in the schools we visit in <placeName>Lambeth</placeName>, or at Cadoxton, we would see some hundreds, perhaps <num value="1000">thousands</num>, to whom we would instinctively turn, and wish we had the power to say something that would encourage them in their careers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>That is just how I feel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Not all who hear are influenced by precept, and not all who see, change because of example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But as I am not singular in anything that I know of, there must <pb n="vi"/>be a goodly number of boys who are penetrable, and it is for these penetrable intelligences, and assimilative organizations, that I would care to leave the truthful record of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>For I believe the story of my efforts, struggles, sufferings, and failures, of the work done, and the work left undone,--I believe this story would help others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If my life had been merely frivolous, a life of purposeless drifting, why, then silence were better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But it has not been so, and therefore my life can teach some lessons, and give encouragement to others.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The pathos of this Autobiography lies in the deprivations and denials of those early years, here recorded for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Yet these sufferings, as he came to realise, were shaping and fitting him for the great work he was to perform; and his training and experiences were perhaps the finest a man could have had, since, day by day, he was being educated for the life that lay before him. <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> writes:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/></p> 
<p>It can be understood how invaluable such a career and such a training, with its compulsory lessons, was to me, as a preparation for the tremendous tasks which awaited me.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A boy of intense and passionate feelings, the longing for home, love, friends, and encouragement, at times amounted to pain; yet all these natural blessings were denied him; he received no affection from parents, no shelter of home, no kindness or help of friends, excepting from his adopted father, who died soon after befriending the lonely boy. Baffled and bruised at every turn, yet <quote>the strong pulse of youth vindicates its right to gladness, even here.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Orphaned, homeless, friendless, destitute, he nevertheless was rich in self-reliance and self-control, with a trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> which never failed him. And so <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> grew to greatness, a greatness which cannot be fully measured by his contemporaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>As a key to <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s life, it may be mentioned that <num value="1">one</num> of his earliest and dearest wishes, often expressed to me in secret, was, by his personal character and the character of his work in every stage of his career, to obliterate the stigma of pauperism which had been so deeply branded into his very soul by the <name>Poor</name>-Law methods, and which in most cases is so lifelong in its blasting effects on those who would strive to rise, ever so little, from such a Slough of Despond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>So that, when he had achieved fame as an explorer, he craved, far more than this, a recognition by the <pb n="vii"/>English and American Public of the high endeavour which was the result of a real nobility of character and aim.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The ungenerous conduct displayed towards <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> by a portion of the <name>Press</name> and Public would have been truly extraordinary, but for the historical treatment of <placeName>Columbus</placeName> and other great explorers into the <name>Unknown</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> was not only violently attacked on his return from every expedition, but it was, for instance, insinuated that he had not discovered <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>, while some even dared to denounce, as forgeries, the autograph letters brought home from <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> to his children, notwithstanding their own assurance to the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This reception produced, therefore, a bitter disappointment, only to be appreciated by the reader when he has completed this survey of <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s splendid personality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>That <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> sought no financial benefit by exploiting <placeName>Africa</placeName>, as he might legitimately have done, is borne out by the fact that instead of becoming a multi-millionaire, as the result of his vast achievements, and his unique influence with the native chiefs, the actual sources of his income were almost entirely literary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This is indicated in the text.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Accepting Free Trade as a policy, the blindness of the <rs>British Nation</rs> to the value of additional colonies, and the indifference, not only of successive Governments, but of the various <orgName n="Chamber of Commerce" type="org">Chambers of Commerce</orgName>, and the industrial community generally, whose business instincts might have been expected to develop greater foresight, was a source of the deepest concern and disappointment to <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>; for it meant the loss to <placeName>England</placeName> both of the whole of the present Congo Free State, and, later, of the monopoly of the <rs>Congo Railway</rs>, now <num value="1">one</num> of the most profitable in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The determined opposition for long exhibited to the acquisition of Uganda and <persName n="British,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:British,India,,,:1"><surname>British</surname></persName> <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">East Africa</placeName> was also, for a time, a great anxiety to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It may also be pointed out here that all that is now <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName> <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">East Africa</placeName> was explored and opened up to commerce and civilisation by <name>British</name> explorers, <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>, <persName n="Burton,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Burton,Richard,F.,,:2"><surname>Burton</surname></persName>, <persName n="Speke,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Speke,John,,,:1"><surname>Speke</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0001.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Dorothy,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Thus <placeName>England</placeName> threw away what individual Empire-builders had won for the realm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The obvious advantages and paramount necessity to a Free-Trade country of having vast new markets of its own are sufficiently apparent, whatever views are held on the difficult Fiscal Question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In the remaining chapters, the aim has been to make him the narrator and interpreter of his own actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>This has been done, wherever possible, by interweaving, into a connected narrative, strands gathered from his unpublished writings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>These materials consist, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, of journals and note-books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>For many years he kept a line-a-day diary; through some periods, especially during his explorations, he wrote a full journal; and at a later period he kept note-books, as well as a journal, for jotting down, sometimes a personal retrospect, sometimes a comment on the society about him, or a philosophical reflection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The material includes, next, a number of lectures, upon his various explorations; these he prepared with great care, but they were never published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They were written after he had published the books covering the same travels; and in the lectures we have the story told in a more condensed and colloquial way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>My hard life in <placeName>Africa</placeName>, many fevers, many privations, much physical and mental suffering, bring me close to the period of infirmities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>My prospects now cannot be blasted by gibes, nor advancement thwarted by prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I stand in no man's way. Therefore, without fear of consequences, or danger to my pride and reserve, I can lay bare all circumstances which have attended me from the dawn of consciousness to this present period of indifference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>I may tell how I came into existence, and how that existence was moulded by contact with others; how my nature developed under varying influences, and what, after life's severe tests, is the final outcome of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>As I have been in the habit of confining myself to myself, my reserve has been repugnant to gossip in every shape or form, and I have ever been the least likely person to hear anything evil of others, because, when the weakness or eccentricity of a casual acquaintance happened to be a topic, I have made it a principle to modify, if I could not change it. In this book I am not translating from a diary, nor is it the harvest of a journal, but it consists of backward glances at my own life, as memory unrolls the past to me. My inclination, as a young man, was always to find congenial souls to whom I could attach myself in friendship, not cling to for support, friends on whom I could thoroughly rely, and to whom I could trustfully turn for sympathy, and the exchange of thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>But, unfortunately, those to whom in my trustful <pb n="xvi"/>age I ventured to consign the secret hopes and interests of my heart, invariably betrayed me. In some bitter moods I have thought that the sweetest parts of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> are wholly inapplicable to actual humanity, for no power, it appeared to me, could ever transform grown &mdash; up human beings so as to be worthy of heavenly blessings.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>But when I emerged from childhood, and learned by experience that there was no love for me, born, so to say, fatherless, spurned and disowned by my mother, beaten almost to death by my teacher and guardian, fed on the bread of bitterness, how was I to believe in Love?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>See what a change <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> have wrought in me. When a child, I loved him who so much as smiled at me; the partner of my little bed, my play-fellow, the stranger boy who visited me; nay, as a flower attracts the bee, it only needed the glance of a human face, to begin regarding it with love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Mere increase of years has changed all that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Never can I recall that state of innocence, any more than I can rekindle the celestial spark, for it was extinguished with the expansion of intellect and by my experience of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Though no doubt much of this extraordinary genealogy is fabulous, it allows all of us plebeians a reasonable hope to believe that we are also descended from that venerated ancestor of our common humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The time has been when patrician families fondly believed their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> progenitor had come direct from Heaven, and we baser creatures had to be content with an earthly sire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I can prove as ancient a descent for myself, though the names of my intermediate progenitors between <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00003.00075" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName> and my grandfathers, <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00003.00076" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, have not been preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>My family belonged to a class always strangely indifferent to written pedigrees, which relied more on oral traditions, the preserving of which has been mostly the duties of females, on account of their superior fluency of speech, and their disposition to cling to their family hearth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>My earliest pains were caused by the endless rehearsal of family history to which my nurse was addicted; for soon after sunset each evening she would insist on taking me before some neighbour's fire, where I would meet about a dozen dames from the <rs type="place">Castle Row</rs>, prepared to indulge in their usual entertainment of recitations from their stock of unwritten folklore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>After a ceremonious greeting and kindly interchange of civil enquiries about each other's health and affairs, they would soon drift into more serious matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>I have a vague idea that much of it bordered on the uncanny and awful, but I retain a strong impression that most of their conversations related to the past and present <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>of their respective families, courtships, marriages, and deaths being prime events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>I also remember that there were many long pauses, during which I could hear a chorus of sympathetic sighs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The episodes which drew these from their affectionate breasts are quite forgotten, but those sighs haunt me still.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Such families as were clustered in front of the <rs>Green</rs> of <placeName reg="Denbigh Castle">Denbigh Castle</placeName> were an exceedingly primitive folk, with far less regard for ancient ancestry than the <name>Bedouin</name> of the <name>Desert</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Indeed, I doubt whether any tradesman or farmer in our parts could say who was his great-great-grandfather, or whether <num value="1">one</num> yeoman out of a <num value="100">hundred</num> could tell who was his ancestor of <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> back.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>My personal recollections do not extend beyond the time I lay in the cradle; so that all that precedes this period I have been obliged to take upon trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Mind and body have grown together, and both will decay according to the tasks or burdens imposed on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>But strange, half-formed ideas glide vaguely into the mind, sometimes, and then I seem not far from a tangible and intelligent view into a distant age. Sometimes the turn of a phrase, a sentence in a book, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faint out-line of a scene, a face like, yet unlike, <num value="1">one</num> whom I knew, an incident, will send my mind searching swiftly down the long-reaching aisles, extending far into remote, pre-personal periods, trying to discover the connection, to forge again the long-broken link, or to re-knit the severed strand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>My father I never knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>I was in my <q direct="unspecified">teens</q> before I learned that he had died within a few weeks after my birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Up to a certain date in the early Forties, all is profound darkness to me. Then, as I woke from sleep <num value="1">one</num> day, a brief period of consciousness suddenly dawned upon my faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>There was an indefinable murmur about me, some unintelligible views floated before my senses, light flashed upon the spirit, and I entered into being.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>At what age I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> received these dim, but indelible, impressions, I cannot guess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It must have been in helpless <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>infancy, for I seem to have passed, subsequently, through a long age of dreams, wherein countless vague experiences, emotions, and acts occurred which, though indefinable, left shadowy traces on my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>During such a mechanical stage of existence it was not possible for me to distinguish between dreams and realities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>I fancy I see a white ceiling, and square joists, with meat-hooks attached to them, a round, pink human face, the frill of a cap, a bit of bright ribbon; but, before I am able to grasp the meaning of what I see, I have lapsed into unconsciousness again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>After an immeasurable time, the faculties seem to be re-awakened, and I can distinguish tones, and am aware that I can see, hear, and feel, and that I am in my cradle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is close by a wooden staircase, and my eyes follow its length up, and then down; I catch sight of a house-fly, and then another, and their buzz and movements become absorbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Presently a woman advances, bends over me a moment, then lifts me up in her arms, and from a great height I survey my world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>There is a settle of dark wood, a bit of carving at the end of it; there is a black, shiny chimney; a red coal-fire, with <num value="1">one</num> spluttering jet of flame, and waving soot-flakes; there is a hissing black kettle, and a thread of vapour from the nozzle; a bright copper bed-warmer suspended to the wall; a display of coloured plates, mainly blue, with <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> pictures on them, arranged over a polished dresser; there is an uneven flagstone floor; a window with diamond panes set in lead; a burnished white table, with <num value="2">two</num> deep drawers in it; a curious old clock, with intensely red flowers above, and chains and weights below it; and, lastly, I see a door cut into <num value="2">two</num> halves, the upper <num value="1">one</num> being wide open, through which I gain my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> view of sky and space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This last is a sight worth seeing, and I open my eyes roundly to take stock of this pearly space and its drifting fleece as seen through the door, and my attention is divided between the sky and the tick-tack of the clock, while forced to speculate what the white day and the pearly void mean.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>There follows a transition into another state of conscious being wherein I appear to have wings, and to be soaring up to the roof of a great hall, and sailing from corner to corner, like a humming bee on a tour of exploration; and, the roof presently <pb id="p.6" n="6"/>being removed, I launch out with wings outspread, joyous and free, until I lose myself in the unknowable, to emerge, sometime after, in my own cradle-nest at the foot of the wooden stairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>And thus, for an unknown stretch of time, I endure my days without apparent object, but quietly observant, and an inarticulate witness of a multitude of small events; and thus I waited, and watched, and dreamed, surrendering myself to my state, undisturbed, unaffected, unresisting, borne along by Time until I could stand and take a larger and more deliberate survey of the strange things done around me. In process of time, however, my tongue learns to form words, and to enter upon its duties, and it is not long before intelligence begins to peep out and to retain durably the sense of existence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It satisfied my curiosity for several years as to the cause of my coming; but, later, I was informed that my mother had hastened to her parents from <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to be delivered of me; and that, after recovery, she had gone back to the <rs>Metropolis</rs>, leaving me in the charge of my grandfather, <persName n="Parry,,Moses,,," id="n0103.0005.00006.00079" reg="default:Parry,Moses,,,"><foreName>Moses</foreName> <surname>Parry</surname></persName>, who lived within the precincts of <placeName reg="Denbigh Castle">Denbigh Castle</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Up to a certain time I could remember well every incident connected with those days; but now I look at the child with wonder, and can scarcely credit that out of that child I grew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The difference between our school and the public grammar school of the period lay in the fact that our instruction was principally religious and industrial, while in the other it was mainly secular and physical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Meantime, remote and secluded from the world without our gates, which rode in fine chariots, or sat in glory on the roof of the <quote>Jellamanjosy</quote> coach, or strode free along the <rs>Queen</rs>'s highway, we vegetated within the high walls surrounding our home of lowliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We could take no part in public rejoicings, or grieve in its sorrows; we knew no Royal or State occasions, shared in no jubilant celebrations, and were equally ignorant of public panics and disturbances, as of the pomp and woes of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Year after year we noted the passing of the seasons by the budding blossoms, the flight of bees, the corn which changed from green to gold, the fall and whirl of leaves, followed soon after by white snow, and blasts of nipping winds, which stiffened our muscles, and sent us shivering to the fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The little shops near and in St. Asaph had somehow the air of large-hearted benevolence, which I never knew to be realised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>How often I tried to peep in, that I might understand the ways of these singular people, having by right divine the privilege of dispensing to all men unlimited stores of food and clothing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>How I envied the grocer's boy, who could dig his hands at his pleasure into inexhaustible barrels of currants and boxes of raisins, and the plenteous loaves of white fragrant sugar, or the smart youth with the blue necktie, who might wear any gorgeous robe he chose, for I believed it was only his modesty which prevented him from appearing in crimson, or yellow, silk and satin!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>We had reason to believe that the great world outside contained lower depths of misery than anything experienced by us; for, now and then, we caught glimpses of horrid, unkempt vagrants as they came to the porter's lodge for a lodging; and, during our visits to St. Asaph, we could not enter the town <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>without being impressed with the squalor of the <rs type="place">Irish Square</rs>, which made us glad that we were not so disreputable as the ragged urchins of that sordid locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Little as we were aware of it, our minds were becoming soiled by prejudices, just as our boots were stained with the greasy mud of that neighbourhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The repulsiveness of the <rs type="place">Square</rs>, and the insolence of the smutty-faced, bare-footed <hi rend="italics">gamins</hi>, made us believe that <name>Irishmen</name> and Roman Catholics were barbarians and idolaters, and when, losing patience with their yelping clamour, we turned to resent their attacks, and saw them skurry to their kennels, we believed ourselves justified in the opinion that the young brats knew nothing of fair fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Probably the very morning that I had had to bide the brunt of their savage rudeness, and had been disgusted with their ugliness, had seen me superintending the cleaning of our dormitory, with a zeal inspired by my firm belief that before we could be called good, we must be clean, within and without, and that our hearts, our persons, and our dwellings, should be without stain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>How I came to manifest the passion of a fanatic for order and cleanliness I know not, yet when it was my turn to clean up and make the beds, I was seized with a consuming desire to exhibit everything at its best, to arrange the beds without a single crease or pucker, to make the folds with mathematical exactness, to dust and polish cup-boards and window-sills until they were speckless, and to make the flagstones shine like mirrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>When I reached my <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> year, the king of the school for beauty and amiability was a boy of about my own age, named <persName n="Roberts,,Willie,,," id="n0103.0005.00022.00119" reg="default:Roberts,Willie,,,"><foreName>Willie</foreName> <surname>Roberts</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Some of us believed that he belonged to a very superior class to our own. His coal-black hair curled in profusion over a delicately moulded face of milky whiteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>His eyes were soft and limpid, and he walked with a carriage which tempted imitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Beyond these indications of him I remember but little, for just then I fell ill with some childish malady which necessitated my removal to the infirmary, where I lay for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But as I was becoming convalescent I was startled by a rumour that he had suddenly died.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>When I heard that his body was in the dead-house I felt stricken with a sense of irreparable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>As the infirmary opened upon the court-yard which contained our <hi rend="italics">morgue</hi>, some of the boys suggested that it might be possible to view him, and, prompted by a fearful curiosity to know what death was like, we availed ourselves of a favourable opportunity, and entered the house with quaking hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The body lay on a black bier, and, covered with a sheet, appeared uncommonly long for a boy. <num value="1">One</num> of the boldest drew the cloth aside, and at the sight of the waxen face with its awful fixity we all started back, gazing at it as if spell-bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>There was something grand in its superb disregard of the chill and gloom of the building, and in the holy calm of the features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It was the face of our dear <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>, with whom we had played, and yet not the same, for an inexplicable aloofness had come over it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Presently the sheet was drawn further away, and we then saw what <num value="1">one</num> of us had insinuated might be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The body was livid, and showed scores of dark weals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/><num value="1">One</num> glance was enough, and, hastily covering it, we withdrew, with minds confirmed in the opinion that signs of violence would appear <pb id="p.23" n="23"/>after death as testimonies against him who was guilty of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>For weeks after this my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought in the morning was of <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>'s dead face, and, in consequence, I could not help looking into every face with something of pity that mankind should be born for death and burial in the cold remorseless earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>When I re-entered the school I found myself curiously regarding <persName n="Francis,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00023.00121" reg="nearbymention:Francis,James,,,"><surname>Francis</surname></persName>, and wondering that he was so insensible to the miserable fate in store for him, and that he could be so pitiless in his cruelty to his fellow-sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>What would he say, I thought, when the <rs>Judge</rs>, who would come to judge the quick and the dead, would ask him, <quote>What hast thou done to thy <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>?</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Some time after <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>'s death, <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>, the scholar, and I became as chummy as twin brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>He was not so amiable as <persName><foreName>Willie</foreName></persName>, but we believed him to be severely good, and far more learned, by which he obtained our respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>He was not a zealous friend, and after some intimacy with him I was often chilled with what appeared to be selfishness in him. It may have been that I was too exacting, but I certainly thought that it was not in his nature to be scrupulous in the keeping of the pact of chumship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>If a cake or an apple was to be divided into <num value="2">two</num>, an uneasy feeling came over me that he took pains to pick out the larger half, and in any dispute with other boys <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName> was not so resolutely insistent on my behalf as the vow of brotherhood demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>After a few weeks of effort to make inward apologies for his laxity and backward-ness, it was forced upon me that he was by nature indifferent to his obligations, and it was agreed that each should be a friend unto himself for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Twice on Sunday we had full services, and after supper the porter of the establishment, who was a Methodist of super-fervid zeal, would treat us to a lengthy and noisy prayer, which, as I think of it now, was rather a tedious string of adjurations to, and incriminations of the <name>Almighty</name>, than a supplication for grace to the <name>Creator</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They were cruelly unkind, they were unjust in their punishments, they were censorious without cause, and most ungentle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>They asked for <pb id="p.25" n="25"/><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> forgiveness for their trespasses, but were relentless in their condemnation of the smallest fault we committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>When I came to think of that beast Will <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00025.00127" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, and that imp <persName n="Davies,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00025.00128" reg="nearbymention:Davies,Tom,,,"><surname>Davies</surname></persName>, and that tale-bearer and mischief-maker <persName n="Williams,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00025.00129" reg="nearbymention:Williams,George,,,"><surname>Williams</surname></persName>, my gorge rose against them, and I felt that the circumstances of <persName><foreName>Enoch</foreName></persName>'s life were not like mine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>However, I made a grand effort to free myself from my vanity and pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I compelled myself for a season to make the sacrifices demanded of me. I championed ugly Will against his oppressors, and suppressed my scorn of <persName n="Davies,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00025.00130" reg="nearbymention:Davies,Tom,,,"><surname>Davies</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>I strove to like <persName n="Williams,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00025.00131" reg="nearbymention:Williams,George,,,"><surname>Williams</surname></persName>, though I feared he was incorrigible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>I sought to surprise each of them with good offices, and in the process endured much contumely, because human beings are so prone to misconstrue <num value="1">one</num>'s actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I rose at <time value="12am">midnight</time> to wrestle in secret with my wicked self, and, while my school-fellows sweetly reposed, I was on my knees, laying my heart bare before Him who knows all things, vowing that the next day should be a witness of my sincerity, and that I would have no fear of derision for attempts at well-doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I would promise to abstain from wishing for more food, and, to show how I despised the stomach and its pains, I would divide <num value="1">one</num> meal out of the <num value="3">three</num> among my neighbours; half my suet pudding should be given to Ffoulkes, who was afflicted with greed, and, if ever I possessed anything that excited the envy of another, I would at once surrender it. Greater proof than these of my resolve to be perfect I thought I could not show, and when I had done my part, I hoped to see the sign of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> favour in milder treatment by <persName n="Francis,,,,," id="n0103.0005.00025.00132" reg="nearbymention:Francis,James,,,"><surname>Francis</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>I cannot recollect that the season which I devoted to the subjection of self witnessed the lenity which I anticipated, or that it had any effect beyond a feeling of physical weakness; but, indirectly, I am not sure that it was wholly without gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Without the faith which supported me, I might never have thought of experimenting on Will and practising it on myself, my dislikes, and passions, and placing them at the service of those I had despised; and I am inclined to think that the feeling of friendlessness was soothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It was a comfort to know that though without a parent, relation, or friend on earth to turn to, I had a Father in Heaven before Whom I was the equal of the mightiest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/><pb id="p.26" n="26"/></p> 
<p>I believed in the immediate presence of Angels who were deputed to attend us for our protection, that the emissaries of the <name>Evil</name> <num value="1">One</num> ranged about during the darkness of the night, seeking to wreak their spite against those averse to them, and I believed that the frightful dreams from which we sometimes suffered were due to their machinations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Sometimes I woke up in the middle of the night, after a tremendous struggle with a nightmare, and, gaspingly looking out, fancied I saw the evil spirits crowding the darkness and sailing about like huge fantastic microbes, or standing, shadowy-grey, at the foot of the bed. I would rub my eyes hard for a clearer vision, and I would observe them retreat against the cold bare walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Within, all was terror and confusion, entreaties to Heaven for protection, admonition respecting some neglect of prayer, or coldness in devotion; and I would rise from bed on being thus informed of the remedy, and indulge in the sacred theft of prayer with the humbleness due from a little child praying to the <rs>Universal Father</rs> and Creator.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>If, by accident, I was discovered, the day following was certain to be <num value="1">one</num> of torture, an opprobrious nickname, or bitter gibe, taunts, immodest expressions or gestures; every kind of conspiracy would be made to excite the demon that lurks within every human breast, so that by night, what with hate of my fellows, burning anger at their atrocious conduct, remorse for having succumbed to rage at their wicked practices, I had collapsed from my virtuous state, to be again brought to my sense of inborn sinfulness by some nightly visitation, or a curious gush of tearful repentance, and an agony of longing for the love of some human being.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The religious convictions of my childhood were too intense and real to omit recalling them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Often it appeared as though it were wholly useless to struggle against evil, yet there was an infinitesimal improvement in each stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The character was becoming more and more developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The temper was becoming firmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Experience was teaching me something of that great lesson of life which enables <num value="1">one</num> to view more calmly lapses of condition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Thus there are <num value="2">two</num> things for which I feel grateful to this strange institution of St. Asaph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>My fellow-man had denied <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>to me the charm of affection, and the bliss of a home, but through his charity I had learned to know <name n="God" type="God">God</name> by faith, as the <rs>Father</rs> of the fatherless, and I had been taught to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It is impossible that in a Christian land like <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName> I could have avoided contracting some knowledge of the <name>Creator</name>, but the knowledge which is gained by hearing is very different from that which comes from feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Nor is it likely that I would have remained altogether ignorant of letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Being as I was, however, the circumstances of my environment necessarily focussed my attention on religion, and my utterly friendless state drove me to seek the comfort guaranteed by it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>It would be impossible to reveal myself, according to the general promise involved in the title of this book, if I were to be silent regarding my religious convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Were I to remain silent, the true key to the actions of my life would be missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Or, rather, let me try to put the matter more clearly: the secret influence which inspired what good I may have done in life, for the same reason prevented me from doing evil, curbed passion, guided me when the fires of youth, licentious company, irreverent mates, and a multitude of strange circumstances must have driven me into a confirmed state of wickedness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>I was therefore grateful, after all, for the implanting of religious principles in me by the <name>Biblical</name> education given me in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The fear of doing wrong intentionally, the feeling of reverence, the impulse of charity, the possession of a conscience, are all due to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Without this teaching I should have been little superior to the <name>African</name> savage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>It has been the driving power for good, the arrestor of evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It has given me an acute and perceptive monitor, able by its own delicacy to perceive evil no matter how deceptive its guise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>It has formed a magnet by which to steer more straightly than I could otherwise have done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>My belief that there was a <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, overseeing every action, observing and remembering, has come often between me and evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Often when sorely tempted, came the sudden strength to say, <quote>No, I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> not, it will be wicked; not criminal, but sinful; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> sees me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>It is precisely for this strength that I am grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Reason would not have been sufficient to restrain me from yielding to temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It required a conscience, and a religious conviction created it. That same inward monitor <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>has restrained me from uttering idle words, from deceiving my fellow-creatures with false promises, and from hastily condemning them without sufficient evidence, from listening to slanders, and from joining with them, from yielding to vindictiveness; it has softened a nature that without its silent and gentle admonitions would, I am sure, be much worse than it is. I do not claim that it has always been successful,--far from it,--but I am grateful for what it has done; and this feeling, so long as I possess it, will induce me to hope that it will ever remain with me, a restraining power, a monitor to do my duty to my Creator, and to my fellow-men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Whether these religious convictions would have continued with me had I lived the life of the city is another question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>I think not. At least, not in sufficient force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>A journalist's life in New York does not give time for reflection or introspection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Religion grew deep roots in me in the solitude of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, so that it became my mentor in civilization, my director, my spiritual guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>With religious conviction we can make real and substantial progress; it gives body, pith, and marrow; without it, so-called progress is empty and impermanent,--for without the thought of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> we are tossed about on a sea of uncertainty; for what is our earth compared with the vast universe of worlds in unmeasurable space?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>But above all the vastness of infinity, of which the thoughts of the wisest men can extend to but an infinitesimal fraction, is the <name>Divine</name> and Almighty Intellect which ordered all this; and to Him I turn,--the <name>Source</name> of the highest energy, the <name>Generator</name> of the principle of duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>In the adults' ward at St. Asaph was a harmless imbecile, named <persName n="Holywell,,John,,," id="n0103.0005.00028.00133" reg="default:Holywell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Holywell</surname></persName>, who had been a resident of the house for about a score of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The words had scarcely escaped me ere I found myself swung upward into the air by the collar of my jacket, and flung into a nerveless heap on the bench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Then the passionate brute pummelled me in the stomach until I fell backward, gasping for breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Again I was lifted, and dashed on the bench with a shock that almost broke my spine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>What little sense was left in me after these repeated shocks made me aware that I was smitten on the cheeks, right and left, and that soon nothing would be left of me but a mass of shattered nerves and bruised muscles.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Recovering my breath, finally, from the pounding in the stomach, I aimed a vigorous kick at the cruel Master as he stooped to me, and, by chance, the booted foot smashed his glasses, and almost blinded him with their splinters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Starting backward with the excruciating pain, he contrived to stumble over a bench, and the back of his head struck the stone floor; but, as he was in the act of falling, I had bounded to my feet, and possessed myself of his blackthorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Armed with this, I rushed at the prostrate form, and struck him at random over his body, until I was called to a sense of what I was doing by the stirless way he received the thrashing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>I was exceedingly puzzled what to do now. My rage had vanished, and, instead of triumph, there came a feeling that, perhaps, I ought to have endured, instead of resisting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>whatever innocent trust I may have entertained, that beyond the walled domain of the <rs type="place">Union House</rs> I should meet with glad friends, was doomed to an early disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>I had often dreamed of a world that was next to Heaven for happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Many a long summer evening I had spent looking out of our windows upon the radiant vale of Clwyd, and the distant lines of hills which rose beyond leafy Cefn, exciting my imagination by the recital to myself of fanciful delights, which I believed to exist beyond the far horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The tides of humanity, as they swept gaily over the highroad in view of our gates, had seemed very beautiful and happy; but, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> contact with the highly privileged people whom we met on the turnpike, they did not appear so gracious to me. Whether they rolled-by in carriages, or sat on the coach, enjoyed the air at the cottage-door, or smashed stones by the road-side, drove swift gigs, or tramped afoot like ourselves, all alike were harsh and forbidding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Even lads of our own age and frocked children assailed us with scorn and abuse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>It impressed itself on me that we were outcasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>We wore the <name>Workhouse</name> livery, and this revealed the sphere we belonged to, to all who met us. Beings in that garb had no business on the public road!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>We were clearly trespassers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>What with the guilty feeling of having absconded, and outraging the public sense by our appearance in scenes where we were undoubted aliens, we began to feel exceedingly uncomfortable, and shrank from the view of every <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>As night approached, other anxieties troubled us sorely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Where should we sleep?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>How should we subsist?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>We could not remain always in hiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The sun was about setting when we came across a disused lime-kiln.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>We crept through the arch into the open bowl-like interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>By cuddling together, we could just find room in the bottom to sleep; but, as it was <pb id="p.36" n="36"/>still daylight, our feet could be seen through the opening of the arch by the passers-by, and we should be taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>We therefore had to lean on the sides of the kiln until the darkness came, before we could forget our misery in sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>In this awkward position we waited silently for the darkness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Our limbs ached with fatigue, our spirits were dejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>In about an hour, probably, it would be dark; but in such a mood, what a time to wait!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Many illusions disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Nothing of what I had seen through the <name>Workhouse</name> windows was real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I had been all the time dreaming, having taken too seriously facts which had been sugared with pleasantness for our childish minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The world was ugly, cruel, and hard, and all grown &mdash; up people were liars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>From my nurse and old women, my head had been crammed with ghost stories, and I had become a believer in signs, omens, auguries, and fetishism, transmitted to me by foolish peasants from our tattooed ancestors, until the clear glass of my mind had been blurred; and, as the darkness settled over me, memories of its spectral inhabitants came trooping to the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>I fancied I saw images of those beings who haunt the dark when unguarded by lock and bolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Through the top and arch of the kiln, we were open to their assaults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>I became nervously watchful, and, the more I strained my eyes, the more I fancied I could see flaming imps acting a ceaseless pantomime of malice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Once or twice I thought I felt the whiff of ghostly wings, and my terror caused a feeling of suffocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The only safe thing to do was to talk, tell stories to each other, that the accursed spirits might know we were awake and fearless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>I continued awake by this method until the sky began to pale before the advancing dawn, when I softly dropped into sleep, and so passed the most uneasy night I remember.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>With the sunrise, we rose, stiff and hungry, to resume our flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>By preference, we clung to the lanes, as being the safest for fugitives who wore the parish uniform; but, near Corwen, our aching vitals compelled us to brave the publicity of the pike road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>We halted, at last, before a stone cottage, at the door of which a stout and motherly old woman stooped over a wash-tub resting on a <num value="3">three</num>-legged stool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Her frilled cap looked very white and clean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>A flaxen-haired baby sat astride of the door-sill, beating a tom-tom with a piece of china-ware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>Our <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>desperately famished state overcame our shyness, and we asked for a piece of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>The woman braced herself up, and, giving us a compassionate look, said, <quote>You seem poorly, children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>Surely you don't belong to these parts?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> <quote>No, ma'am, we belong to St. Asaph.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> <quote>Yes, ma'am.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>She invited us cordially to enter, and, opening a cupboard that was under the stairs, drew out a loaf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>She cut off thick slices, smeared them with butter and treacle, and, filling <num value="2">two</num> large mugs with buttermilk, set them before us, and bade us <quote>eat and welcome.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>After such kindness it was not difficult to win our confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>I well remember how the homely clock, with its face crowned at the top with staring red flowers, ticked loudly during the pauses of our narrative, and how the minute-hand flung itself recklessly round the dial; how, near the door, the wash-tub became covered with a scum as the soap-bubbles exploded <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>; how the good woman suckled her babe to sleep, as we talked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The coloured picture of that cottage stands out unfading in my memory, despite the varied accumulations of so many years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>Having been strengthened by food, and comforted with friendly advice, we decided it would be best to push on towards <placeName key="tgn,7008548" n="1.000 1" reg="denbigh,denbighshire,wales,united kingdom,europe">Denbigh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Night overtook us, and we sought the lee of a haystack in a field, too tired to fear ghosts; and, early next day, drew near the castled town we both loved so well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>We reached the foot of <address><street n="High Street">High Street</street></address>, and looked with envy at the shop-boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>We could not help peeping at the bright shop-windows which exposed such varied wealth, and admiring those singularly-favoured people, who were able to dispense such assortments of luxuries among their friends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>He was hugged convulsively in the maternal bosom, patted on the back, his hair was frizzled by maternal fingers, and I knew not whether the mother was weeping or laughing, for tears poured over smiles, in streams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The exhibition of fond love was not without its effect on me, for I learned how a mother should behave to her boy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>A glow of comfort warmed our hearts as she bustled about the kitchen, intent upon unusual hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>She relieved us of our caps, dusted a polished chair for each of us with her apron, and set them in the snug ingle-corners, laughing and weeping alternately, and sending waves of emotion careering over us out of sheer sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>She burned to talk, but reminded herself, by starts, of our necessities, making us smile at her self-reproaches, her hurried attempts to snatch the food from the shelves of her dresser, and her evident intention to be bountiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>She, finally, arranged a table, and, from a new tin-loaf, cut out generous breadths, on which she dropped circles of black treacle, and pressed them into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>After piling other lavishly-buttered slices on a plate near by, the boiling water was poured over the tea, and not until she had seen us well engaged on her bounties did she slacken her haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Then, bringing a high-backed chair between us, she laid <num value="1">one</num> hand on the other in her lap, and exclaimed,--</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>As my cousin possessed a fair library of solid literature, I soon made sensible progress, as, with his system of tuition, and my eager desire to acquit myself to his satisfaction, I could not fail to do.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He was, however, of delicate constitution, <pb id="p.48" n="48"/>like many slender, overgrown youths, and his health required careful watching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>His residence being new, and exposed to the winds blowing over the moory waste, the damp was perceptible in the weeping walls and the mouldy wall-paper, and he was often subject to fits of lassitude and weakness; but when in tone, he showed all the energy of his mother, and was indefatigable in teaching me. At meal-times he was always cross-examining me on the subject of my tasks, his conversation was highly scholastic, and, when out walking with him, I was treated to lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Most of the boys were uncongenial through their incurable loutishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Few of them were cleanly or orderly, and their ideas of what was right differed from mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Most of them snuffled abominably, while as to being tidy and neat, no savages could have shown greater indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>It would be easier to transform apes into men, than to make such natures gentle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>The gentlest retort was followed by expressions which reminded me of my ignoble origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Often they did not wait to be provoked, but indulged their natural malice as from divine privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The effect of it was to drive me within my own shell, and to impress the lesson on me that I was forever banned by having been an inmate of the <name>Workhouse</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>After months of indefatigable tuition, he relaxed in his efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>He began to affect a disbelief in my advancement, and to indulge in scorn of my progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>My short-comings were now the theme of his discourses, each time we met. My task became heavier and longer, his sarcasms sharper, and his manner more provoking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>As I owed a home to him I was debarred from retorting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>He did not stoop to the vulgar punishment of birching or caning, but inflicted moral torture by a peculiar gift of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>His cutting words were more painful to bear than any amount of physical castigation; their effect bewildered me and made me more despairing, and I think his unkindness increased as my helpless dependency on him was made more manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>My loudest shout could not be heard by man, my wildest thought was free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>The rolling clouds above me had a charm indescribable, they seemed to carry my spirit with them to see the huge, round world, in some far-off corner of which, invisible to everyone but <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I was to work out my particular task.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>At such a time, <persName><foreName>Enoch</foreName></persName>'s glorious and sweet life would be recalled in the lovely land of flowers and sunshine, and it would not be long before I would feel inspired to imitate his holy blamelessness, and, rising to my feet, I would gather stones, and raise a column to witness my vows, like <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> in the patriarchal days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Those hours on the top of the <name>Craig</name> were not wholly without their influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>They stirred up such oppressive fancies that I regarded myself as the most miserable being in existence, deprived of even a right to love the land that I was born in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Who can describe that sadness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>Anguish racked me, and a keen sense of woe and utter beggary so whelmed the mind that my ears became dead to words, my eyes blind to all colours, save that which sympathised with the gloom within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>No <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> had I, nor land, nor any right even to such small share as might be measured for my grave; but my memory was rich with pleasant thoughts, stored with scenic beauties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Often as I have left <name>English</name> shores since, the terrible dejection of spirit of that day has ever recurred to my mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>When about half-way across the <rs>Dee</rs> estuary, I was astonished at seeing many great and grand ships sailing, under towers of bellying canvas, over the far-reaching sea, towards some world not our own. Not long after there appeared on the horizon clouds of smoke, out of which, presently, wound a large city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>There I saw distinctly masses of houses, immensely tall chimneys, towers, lengths of walls, and groves of ship-masts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>My rustic intelligence was diverted by the attempt to comprehend what this sight could mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Was this <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, this monstrous aggregation of buildings, and gloomy home of ships?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Before I could answer the question satisfactorily, <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> was all around me: it had grown, unperceived by me, into a land covered by numberless structures of surpassing vastness and height, and spread on either side of our course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>We sped along a huge sea-wall, which raised its grim front as <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>high as a castle, and before us was a mighty river; on either side there was an immeasurable length of shore, crowded with houses of all sorts; and when I looked astern, the <num value="2">two</num> lines with their wonders of buildings ran far out towards the sea, whence we had so swiftly come.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Before my distracted mind could arrange the multitude of impressions which were thronging on me, my aunt, who had sat through all unmoved and silent, touched me on the shoulder and bade me follow her ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Mechanically, I obeyed, and stepped out on a floating stage which was sufficiently spacious to accommodate a whole town-full of people; and, walking over an iron bridge, we gained the top of the colossal wall, among such a number of human beings that I became speechless with fear and amazement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Entering a carriage, we drove along past high walls that imprisoned the shipping, through an atmosphere impregnated with fumes of pitch and tar, and streets whose roar of traffic was deafening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>My ears could distinguish clinks of iron, grinding roll of wheels, tramp of iron-shod hoofs, but there was a hubbub around them all which was loud and strenuous, of which I could make nothing, save that it was awful and absorbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>Fresh from the slumbering existence of a quiet country home, my nerves tingled under the influence of the ceaseless crash and clamour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>The universal restlessness visible out of the carriage windows, and the medley of noises, were so overwhelming that from pure distraction and an impressive sense of littleness in the midst of such a mighty Babel, every intelligent faculty was suspended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>The tremendous power of this aggregate force so fiercely astir, made me feel so limp and helpless that again I was tempted to implore my aunt to return with me to the peace of <placeName reg="Tremeirchion">Tremeirchion</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>But I refused the cowardly impulse, and, before my total collapse, the carriage stopped at an hotel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>We were received by such smiling and obliging strangers that my confidence was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>The comfort visible everywhere, and the composed demeanour of my aunt and her friends, were most soothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>In the evening, <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Maria</foreName></persName> appeared, and her warm greetings served to dissipate all traces of my late panic, and even infused a trifle of exaltation, that my insignificant self was <pb id="p.58" n="58"/>henceforth to be considered as <num value="1">one</num> of the many-throated army which had made <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> so terrible to a youthful rustic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>She was pressed to stay for a <num value="9">nine</num>-o'clock supper, but when she rose to depart I was by no means reluctant to brave the terror of the street.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>The streets no longer resounded with the startling hurly-burly of the day. At a quick trot we drove through miles of lighted ways, and by endless ranges of ill-lit buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Once I caught a glimpse of a spacious market, aglow with <rs n="gas lights" type="product">gas-lights</rs>, where the view of innumerable carcases reminded me of the wonderful populousness of the great city; but beyond it lay the peaceful region of a sleeping people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>My precious box, with its <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> outfit, was carried into the house, and a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> later I was in the arms of cheery <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>In expectation of my coming there was quite a large party assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>His fault &mdash; if fault it may be called &mdash; may be guessed by the fact that, while his family was increasing, he had rashly undertaken to burden himself with the care of a boy of my age, while the slightest accident or indisposition would leave him wholly without means to support anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>Before I parted from these boys, who were prodigies of practical wisdom, and profound in all nautical matters, I had learned by comparing the <rs>Red Jacket</rs> and <rs>Dreadnought</rs> with the <rs><orgName n="American Congress" type="congress">American Congress</orgName></rs> and <rs>Winfield Scott,</rs> the difference between a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class clipper and an ordinary emigrant packet, and why some ships were <rs>Black-Ballers</rs> and others <rs>Red-Crossers,</rs> and how to distinguish between a vessel built in <placeName reg="Boston, Lincolnshire, England" key="tgn,7010726">Boston</placeName> and <num value="1">one</num> of <name>British</name> build.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>This man, a hard, sinister-faced Scotsman, for his fixed scowl, and implacable irascibility, was a twin brother of Spleen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>There never was such a constant fault-finder, and, for general cantankerousness, I have never met his like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>The necessity of finding some work to do, and of never leaving it, except for a change of work, called forth my utmost efforts to please; but the perpetual scolding and cross tantrums, in which he seemed to take delight, effectually baffled my simple arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>Heaven forbid that after such a long period I should malign him, but I cannot resist the conviction that when he died, those who had known him must have breathed freer!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Wretched as was my fortnight's stay at the butcher's under the inhumanly-malicious foreman, it was the means of my becoming more intimately acquainted with the stern lords of the sea, and their stately ships; for my work consisted in carrying baskets of fresh provisions to the vessels in the <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>docks; and Time and Fate had so ordered it that through this acquaintance I should be shunted into another line of life.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>The finances of the family had fallen very low, and it had been evident that here, also, as at Ffynnon Beuno, there was a wide distinction between children who had parents and those who were orphaned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>For if ever a discussion rose between my cousin and myself, my uncle and aunt were invariably partial to their own, when called to arbitrate between us. It was obvious that I was the least aggressive and troublesome, the most respectful and sympathetic, of the younger members of the family, but these merits were as naught when weighed in the scales of affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>Teddy's temper, made arrogant by the conceit that he was his father's son, required to be curbed sometimes; but if I asserted myself, and promised him a thrashing, the maternal bosom was a sure refuge; and, as each mother thinks her son more perfect than any other boy, a certain defeat awaited me. Just as I had submitted to the humours of <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> at Ffynnon Beuno, I was forced to submit to those of Teddy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>If aunt's censures of me were not sufficient to ensure immunity to the nagging boy, there was the old man's rough tongue to encounter.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Slowly the thought was formed that if I were not to be permitted to resent Teddy's infirmities of temper, nor to obtain the protection of his over-indulgent parents, my condition could not be worse if I exchanged the growing intolerance of the evil for some other, where, at least, I should enjoy the liberty of kicking occasionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>On striking a balance between the gains of living with Teddy's family and the crosses received through Teddy's insolence, it appeared to my imperfect mind that my humiliation was in excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>I had not obtained the clerkship for which I had left <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName>, my gold sovereign was gone, all my clothes were in the pawnshop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>As I strode towards home, my feelings varied from spasms of regret to gushes of joy, as I mentally analysed the coming change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Larded bread, and a sordid life with its pawnshops and family bickerings, were to be exchanged for full rations and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Constant suppression from those who usurped the right to control my actions, words, and thoughts, was to be exchanged for the liberty enjoyed by the rest of the world's toilers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>These were the thoughts which pleased me; but when I regarded the other side, a haunting sense of insecurity and foreboding <pb id="p.68" n="68"/>sobered me, and made me unhappy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>Oh! if my discontent had not been so great, if <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> had been only more just, I had clung to them like a limpet to a rock!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>I was gradually becoming seasoned, and indifferent to the swing-swang of the sea. As <persName n="Nelson,,,,," id="n0103.0007.00076.00270" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelson</surname></persName> said, with a condescending but evil smile, I was <quote>fresh as a daisy.</quote>

From sunrise down to the decline of day our mast-heads drew apparently the same regular lines and curves against a clear sky. But now the blue disappeared under depths of clouds which intensified into blackness very rapidly, and the whistling whispers in the shrouds changed their note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>The sea abandoned its mechanical heave, and languid upshoot of scattered crests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>Whether the sky had signalled the change and the sea obeyed, or whether the elements were acting simultaneously, I knew not, but, just as the cloudiness had deepened, a shadow passed over the ocean, until it was almost black in colour; and then, to windward, I could see battalion after battalion of white-caps rushing gaily, exultingly, towards us. The watches were mustered: captain and mates appeared with oil-skins ready, and when the wind began to sing in <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>louder notes, and the great packet surged over on her side, and the water shot through the scuppers, the captain shook his head disparagingly and cried, <quote>Shorten sail, <persName n="Waters,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0007.00077.00272" reg="mostcommon:Waters,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Waters</surname></persName>; in with royals and top-gallant sails, down with the flying jib,</quote> etc., etc.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>His trumpet-like voice was heard in &lsquo;larum tones, as though the existence of a fleet was at stake; and every <quote>man-jack</quote> seemed electrified and flew to his duty with all ardour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>The warning sounds of the wind had announced that intensity of action was expected from every soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>The waves leaped over the high foreboard, and the ship was pressed over until the deck was as steep as the roof of a church, and a foaming cataract impended over us. Then it was the mates bawled out aloud, and sailors clambered up the shrouds in a frenzy of briskness, and the deck-hands bawled and sang after a fashion I had not heard before, while blocks tam-tammed recklessly, great sail-sheets danced wildly in the air, and every now and then a thunder sound, from bursting canvas, added to the general excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>Though somewhat bewildered by the windy blasts, the uproar of rushing waters, and the fury of captain and crew, I could not help being fascinated by the scene, and admiring the passionate energy of officers and crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>When the area of sail had been reduced to the limit of safety, we had a clearer view fore and aft, and I had more leisure to listen to the wind-music in the shrouds, to observe the graver aspect of the sea, and to be influenced by unspeakable impressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>From this date began, I think, the noting of a strange coincidence, which has since been so common with me that I accept it as a rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>It was a new idea that came across my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>My memory clung to it as a novelty, and at every instance of the coincidence I became more and more confirmed that it was a rule, as applied to me; but, until it was established, I continued to bless those who persecuted me with their hideous curses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>I soon became sensible of a kindling elation of feeling, for the speech of all to me was as though everyone recognised that I had entered into the great human fraternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>The abruptness of the transition, from the slave of yesterday into the free-man of to-day, endowed with a sacred inviolability of person, astonished me.

<p>My activity and fresh memory were soon appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>Half-a-dozen times a day my ready answers saved time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>My hearing seemed to them to be phenomenal; and my accuracy in remembering the numbers of kegs, cases, and sacks remaining in store, caused me, before the end of the week, to be regarded as a kind of walking inventory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>I could tell where each article was located, and the contents of the various lofts had also been committed to my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Unlike the young gentlemen, I never argued, or contradicted, or took advantage of a pettish ebullition to aggravate temper; and, what was a great relief to persons with responsibilities in a warm climate, I was always at hand, near the glass-door of the office, awaiting orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>Previous to my arrival, <persName n="Dan,,,,," id="n0103.0008.00093.00326" reg="mostcommon:Dan,nomatch:0"><surname>Dan</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Samuel</foreName></persName> had always found something to do at a distance, either upstairs or in the back-yard; they pretended not to hear; and it had been a fatiguing task to call them, and trying to the patience to wait for them; but now I was within easy hail, and my promptitude was commended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>Thereupon my week's trial ended satisfactorily, even more so than I had anticipated, for I was permanently engaged at <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure> a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Such a sum left me with <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> a month, net, after payment of board and lodging, and was quite a fortune in <pb id="p.94" n="94"/>my eyes.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>Long before the <quote><persName n="Windermere,,,,," id="n0103.0008.00094.00331" reg="mostcommon:Windermere,nomatch:0"><surname>Windermere</surname></persName></quote> had sailed back for Liver-pool with her cotton cargo, a great change had come over me. Up to my arrival in New Orleans, no indulgence had been shown me. I was scarcely an hour away from the supervision of someone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>From my nurse's maternal care, I had passed under the strict regime of the <rs>Orphan</rs>'s Academy &mdash; the <rs type="place">Work-house</rs>; thence I had been transferred to the no-less-strict guardianship of <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, and the severe <rs>Moses</rs>, thence into that of <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>; and, afterwards, had tasted of the terrible discipline of an American packet-ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>Draconian rules had been prescribed; the birch hung ever in view in <num value="1">one</num> place, censure and menace at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>At <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s there was no alternative but obedience or the street; and the packetship was furnished with rope's ends and belaying-pins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>But, within a few weeks of arriving in <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName>, I had become different in temper and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>That which was natural in me, though so long repressed, had sprung out very quickly under the peculiar influence of my surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>The childish fear of authority had fled &mdash; for authority no longer wore its stem, relentless aspect, but was sweetly reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>Those who <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>exercised it were gentle and sociable, and I repaid them with respect and gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>To them I owed my happiness; and my new feeling of dignity made me stretch myself to my full height, and revel luxuriously in fond ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>I possessed properties in my person which I instinctively valued, and felt bound to cultivate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>The <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two-feet</measure> square of the street I occupied were mine for the time being, and no living man could budge me except at his peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>The view of the sky was as freely mine as another's. These American rights did not depend on depth of pocket, or stature of a man, but every baby had as much claim to them as the proudest merchant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>Neither poverty nor youth was degrading, nor was it liable to abuse from wealth or age. Besides my youth, activity, and intelligence, of which I had been taught the value, I had become conscious of the fact that I possessed privileges of free speech, free opinions, immunity from insult, oppression, and the contempt of class; and that, throughout America, my treatment from men would solely depend upon my individual character, without regard of family or pedigree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>These were proud thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>I respired more freely, my shoulders rose considerably, my back straightened, my strides became longer, as my mind comprehended this new feeling of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>To the extent of so much I could not be indebted to any man living; but for the respectability of the covering and comfort of the body, and the extension of my rights to more ground than I could occupy standing, I must work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>Inspired of these thoughts, I was becoming as un-English in disposition as though I had been <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> in the land, and, as old <persName n="Browne,Sir,Thomas,,," id="n0103.0008.00095.00332" reg="default:Browne,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Browne</surname></persName> puts it, <quote>of a constitution so general that it consorted and sympathised</quote> with things American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>My <name>British</name> antipathies and proclivities were dropping from me as rapidly as the littlenesses of my servile life were replaced by the felicities of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>I shared in the citizens' pride in their splendid port, the length and stability of their levee, their unparalleled lines of shipping, their magnificent array of steamers, and their majestic river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>I believed, with them, that their Custom-<persName n="House,,,,," id="n0103.0008.00095.00333" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>, when completed, would be a matchless edifice, that Canal Street was unequalled for its breadth, that Tchapitoulas Street was, beyond compare, the busiest street in the world, that no markets equalled those of <pb id="p.96" n="96"/>New Orleans for their variety of produce, and that no city, not even <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, could exhibit such mercantile enterprise, or such a smart go-ahead spirit, as old and young manifested in the chief city of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>I am not sure that I have lost all that lively admiration yet, though I have since seen dozens of cities more populous, more cultivated, and more opulent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>Many years of travel have not extinguished my early faith, but it would require ages to eradicate my affection for the city which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taught me that a boy may become a <hi rend="italics">man</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Had the joylessness of boyhood endured a few years longer, it is probable that the power of joyousness would have dried up; but, fortunately, though I had seen <num value="15">fifteen</num> summers, I was a mere child in experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>It was only <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> since I had left St. Asaph, and but <measure n="2.5months" type="date">two months and a half</measure> since I had entered the world outside my family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>Since I became a man, I have often wondered what would have become of me had my melting mood that last night at <address><street n="Roscommon Street">Roscommon Street</street></address> lasted a little longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>It was the turning-point of my life, I am disposed to think, and it was good for me to have had the courage to say <quote>No,</quote> at that critical moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>A trifle more perseverance, on the part of <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, would have overcome my inclination for departure from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and made me a fixture within his own class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>On that occasion my weakly, half-hearted negative served me to good purpose; but I should have been spared many trials had I been educated to utter my <quote> <placeName reg="Noes">Noes</placeName> </quote> more often, more loudly, and more firmly than I have; and I suppose most men have had cause to condemn that unsatisfactory education which sent them into the world so imperfectly equipped for moral resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>In my opinion, the courage to deliver a proper <quote>No</quote> ought to be cultivated as soon as a child's intelligence is sufficiently advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>The few times I have been able to say it have been productive of immense benefit to me, though to my shame, be it said, I yearned to say <quote>Yes.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>He took me by the hand to an ample room luxuriously <pb id="p.99" n="99"/>furnished, and introduced me to a fragile little lady, who was the picture of refinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>My reception was of such a character that it led me to believe she was as tender and mild as her quiet and subdued looks; and the books on the centre table made me think her pious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>Nothing could have been better calculated to conquer my shyness than the gracious welcome she accorded me. We took our respective places at once, she as a motherly patroness, and I as a devotedly-grateful protege, fully sensible of what was due to her as the wife of my benefactor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>Her husband stood towering over me with his hand on my head, and an encouraging smile on his face, that I might speak out without fear; and he watched the impression I made on his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>The ordeal of presentation was made easy through her natural goodness, and the gentle art she possessed of winning my confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>She placed me on a divan near her, and I was soon prattling away with a glibness that a few minutes before would have been deemed impossible to such a stocky boy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>To confine within a sentence my impressions of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lady I ever conversed with, is entirely beyond my power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>There was an atmosphere about her, in the first place, which was wholly new. The elaborateness and richness of dress, the purity and delicacy of her face, the exquisite modulations of her voice, the distinctness of her enunciation, and the sweet courtesy of her manner, I will not say awed me, but it kindled as much of reverence as ever I felt in my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>If I were to combine this with a feeling that the being beside me might command me to endure practically any torture, or dare any danger, for her sake, it will perhaps sum up the effect which this gentlewoman made on my raw mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>It was at this hour I made the discovery of the immense distance between a lady and a mere woman; and, while I gazed at her clear, lustrous eyes, and noted the charms which played about her features, I was thinking that, if a lady could be so superior to an ordinary housewife, with her careless manner of speech, and matter-of-fact ways, what a beautiful thing an angel must be!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>When we adjourned to the breakfast-table, I found more material to reflect upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>There were about a dozen people, of about the age and rank of <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00099.00351" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname n="Stanley"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanley,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0008.00099.00352" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, at the table; and it struck me that there was an almost impassable <pb id="p.100" n="100"/>gulf between me and them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>Their conversation was beyond my understanding, mostly, though I could spell and interpret each word; but the subjects of their talk left me in the clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>Their remarks upon literature, politics, and social life, seemed to me most appropriate to books; but it surprised me to think that people could exchange so much learning across a table with the fluency of boys discussing the quality of pudding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>Their soothing manner of address, the mutual respect, and deferent temper, greatly elevated them above my coarsegrained acquaintances; and, though they must have guessed, by my manner and age, that I did not belong to their sphere, they paid me the honour of including me in their courteous circle, until, unconsciously, I was straining to acquit myself worthily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>Altogether, it was a memorable breakfast; and, when I reached home, it seemed to me that fortune was about to spoil me; otherwise, why this glow and pride that I felt?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>After this <name>Sunday</name>, my acquaintance with <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00100.00353" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName> rapidly ripened into something exceeding common gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>His bearing towards me was different from that which anybody else showed to me. Many were kind and approving; but, nevertheless, no <num value="1">one</num> stooped to court my notice with that warm, genial manner which distinguished <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00100.00354" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>I felt frequently flattered by the encomiums of <persName n="Speake,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00100.00355" reg="nearbymention:Speake,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Speake</surname></persName>, and the friendship of <persName n="Richardson,,,,," id="n0103.0008.00100.00356" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,nomatch:0"><surname>Richardson</surname></persName>; but still, there was something of reserve between us, which kept me somewhat tongue-tied in their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>They never inquired about my welfare or health, or how I liked my boarding-house, or what I thought of anything, or made any suggestion which would stimulate confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Their talks with me were all about the business appertaining to the store, or some hap-hazard remark about the weather, or some scene in the street; but <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00100.00357" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s way was as though it specially concerned him to know everything about me personally, which had the quality of drawing me out, and making me garrulous, to the verge of familiarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>So, little by little, I came to regard him as an elderly associate, with such a charming, infectious frankness, that I could only, for want of a comparison, remember my affection for my old grandfather, as corresponding with the mixed feelings of regard and awe I had towards him. Besides, to be in his company, even for a brief time, was an education for <num value="1">one</num> so <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>ignorant as myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>Information about somebody or something dropped from his lips with every remark he made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>I felt myself becoming intelligent, informed about the geography and history of the city and state that I was in, and learned in the ways and customs of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>The great merchants and institutions assumed a greater interest for me. They were something more than strange names for repetition; they had associations which revealed personalities of worth, colossal munificence, remunerative enterprise, etc., etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>Every <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> I spent with the <name>Stanleys</name>, and the instantaneous impression I had received of their goodness was more than confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>I yielded myself wholly to their influence, so that my conduct when out of their sight was governed by the desire to retain their good opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>Without them, probably, my love of books would have proved sufficient safe-guard against the baser kind of temptations; but, with them, I was rendered almost impregnable to vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>They took me to church, each Sabbath; and, in other ways, manifested a protective care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>I resumed the custom of morning and evening prayer, my industry at the store was of a more thoughtful kind, my comings and goings were of more exemplary punctuality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>The orderly, industrious life I was following not only ensured me the friendship of the <name>Stanleys</name>, but won me favour from <persName n="Speake,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00101.00359" reg="nearbymention:Speake,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Speake</surname></persName>, who, though wearing often a somewhat anxious expression, restrained himself whenever he had an occasion to communicate with me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>In <dateStruct value="-3-"><month reg="3">the third month</month></dateStruct> there was a change at the store.

I was immensely proud, of course, at this acknowledgement; but it was only natural that, being so susceptible and impressionable, it should stimulate me to greater efforts to deserve his approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>Enlightening me, as it did, in duties expected of me, <pb id="p.102" n="102"/>it might be said to have increased my interest in the condition of the store, until it partook of that which a fond proprietor might feel in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>At any rate, this disposition to have everything clean, to keep the stacks in orderly arrangement, to be on hand when wanted, to keep my notes of shipment methodically, to be studiously bent upon perfection in my duties, led to the following incident.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>We were ordered to take stock, and, while counting cases, and sacks, and barrels, etc., I had now and then to rearrange the stacks, because, in the hurry of business, a box of pickles or jams had become mixed with biscuits or candle-boxes; and, in handling these articles, it struck me that several of them were uncommonly light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>I mentioned this, but it did not attract much attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>It was discovered, also, that the coffee-sacks were much slacker than they ought to be; but, though the rents through which the contents must have escaped appeared as if made by rats, as the quantity of berries on the ground was inadequate to the loss, I knew no other way in which to account for it. However, when, on going to the lofts, we gauged the contents of the wine-puncheons and syrup-barrels, and found them to be half-emptied, matters began to look serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>The leakage on the floor was not sufficient to explain the loss of so many gallons; and the discussion between the book-keeper and shipping-clerk suggested trouble when the <quote>old man</quote> would be informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>From what I gathered, the former book-keeper, <persName n="Kennicy,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00102.00364" reg="mostcommon:Kennicy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kennicy</surname></persName>, was supposed to be in fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>We were short of several boxes of biscuits, sardines, and other articles; and it seemed obvious that <persName n="Kennicy,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00102.00365" reg="mostcommon:Kennicy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kennicy</surname></persName> must have omitted to enter sales on his book, and thus caused this unexpected discrepancy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>We do not sell by retail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>If we sold wine, or syrup, at all, we would sell by the cask, or barrel, and not by the gallon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>The barrels seem to tally, but the contents are diminished in some mysterious manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>Then there are the emptied cases, of which this boy has spoken: how can we account for bottles taken from <num value="1">one</num>, <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>and tins from another?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>The invoices were checked when the goods came in, and no deficiency was reported to me. There is gross carelessness somewhere, and it must be looked into,</quote> etc., etc.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>I strove hard to remember whether in conveying the cases to their respective piles, or hoisting the barrels to the lofts, a suspicion of light weight had entered my mind; and while filled with a sense of doubt and misgiving, I proceeded to hunt for a broom to sweep up, before closing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>I found <num value="1">one</num> in the corner of the back-yard; but, on drawing it to me, a tin lunch-bucket was disclosed, the sight of which in such an unexpected place suggested that the broom had been placed to screen it from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>On taking hold of it, I was amazed at its weight; but, on lifting the lid, I no longer wondered, for it was <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> full of golden syrup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>It flashed across my mind that here was the solution of the mystery that troubled us, and that, if <num value="1">one</num> bucket was made the means of surreptitiously conveying golden syrup, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> might be used for the same purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>On searching for the other negro's bucket, I found it placed high above my reach, on a peg, and under his out-door coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>Seizing a board, I struck it underneath, and a few drops of a dark aromatic liquor trickled down the sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>As, now, there could be no reason to doubt that the culprits had been discovered, I hastened to the office to give my information.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>I echoed, quite confounded at the feminine name; and I reproachfully asked, <quote>If you are a girl, say, what do you mean by coming into my bed, and passing yourself off as a boy?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>She had kept up bravely so far, but she now answered me with tears and sobs, and every doubt of her sex vanished, while I was in such a medley of emotions that I stood like <num value="1">one</num> utterly bereft of sense, not knowing what to do. Presently, she said, <quote>Come, let us dress, and I will tell you all about it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/><pb id="p.110" n="110"/></p> 
<p>I lost no time in doing what she advised; and, after taking a turn or <num value="2">two</num> in the yard, returned to find her ready for me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>Now that her sex was revealed, I wondered that I had been so blind as not to perceive it before, for, in every movement, there was unmistakeable femininity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/><persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> made me sit down, and the substance of the story she now told me was as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>She had been born at <placeName reg="Everton, Liverpool, Liverpool" key="tgn,1004447">Everton</placeName>, <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, and, since she had begun to walk, she had lived with a severe old grandmother, who grew more cross as she aged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>From childhood, she had known nothing but ill-treatment; she was scolded and slapped perpetually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>When she was <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of age, she began to struggle with her granny, and, in a short time, she proved that her strength was too great to be beaten by an infirm old woman; little by little, her grandmother desisted from the attempt, but substituted, instead, the nagging system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>As she approached her <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> year, her grandmother developed a parsimony which made her positively hateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>Every crust she ate at the house was begrudged to her, though, so far as she knew, there was no cause for this pinching and starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>Her home contained evidences of respectability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>The furniture was abundant and of good quality, and the many curios in the glass cases in the parlour showed that her parents had been in comfortable circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>How her grandmother obtained her means of living, <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> did not know; but, judging from her dress and condition, her poverty was not so distressing as to be the cause of such extreme penuriousness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>During the last <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, as she was getting on to <num value="15">fifteen</num>, <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> had been acquainted with girlish neighbours, and through them, with some young middies who had just returned from their voyages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>These had delighted to tell her friends of the wonders of foreign lands, and of the genial welcome they had met with from their foreign friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>The stories of their sea-life, and the pictures of <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName> which they gave, fascinated her; and she secretly resolved that, upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> violent outbreak of her grandmother's temper, she would try her fortune as a cabin-boy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>With this view, every penny she could scrape, or steal, from her grandmother she hoarded, until, at last, she had enough to purchase from a slop-shop all she needed for a disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>When her grandmother <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>finally broke out into a bad fit of temper, and, provoked by her defiance, ordered her out of the house, she was ready for her venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>She went to a barber's shop and had her hair cut close; returning home, she dressed herself in boy's costume, and, with a sailor's bag on her back, entered a boarding-house near the docks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>A few days later, she had the good luck to be engaged as a cabin-boy by the captain of the <quote><placeName reg="Pocahontas, Randolph, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009278">Pocahontas</placeName>,</quote> and, by careful conduct, escaped detection during the voyage, though nothing would avail her to avoid the rope's ending and cuffing of the steward and his fellow-officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>By the time she had concluded her narrative, it was full time for me to depart to my work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>We hurriedly agreed to consult together about future plans upon my return in the evening, and I left her with an assurance that all my means and help were at her service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>All that day her extraordinary story occupied my mind, and, though she was undoubtedly an artful and bold character, her uncommon spirit compelled my admiration, while her condition was such as to compel my sympathy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>At the closing hour I sped homeward, but, on arriving at <persName n="Williams,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0008.00111.00416" reg="mostcommon:Williams,Barney,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>'s, I was told <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> had not been seen since the early morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>I waited many hours, but waited in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>She was never seen, or heard of, by me again; but I have hoped ever since that Fate was as propitious to her, as I think it was wise, in separating <num value="2">two</num> young and simple creatures, who might have been led, through excess of sentiment, into folly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>The next Sabbath after the disappearance of <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>, I paid my usual visit to <persName n="Stanley,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0008.00111.00417" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, and was shocked and grieved to hear, from her maid, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, that she was seriously ill, and under medical treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>A glass of ice-water which she had taken on Friday had been speedily followed by alarming symptoms of illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>She was now so prostrated by disease that she required constant attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s face betrayed so much fatigue and anxiety that I tendered my services, and even begged her to employ me in any way. After a little hesitation, she said I might be useful in enabling her to take a little rest, if I would sit at the door, and, upon any movement or sound within the sick chamber, call her. I kept my post all through the day and night, and, though there were frequent calls on <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, her snatches of rest served to <pb id="p.112" n="112"/>maintain her strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>As I went off to my labour, I promised to solicit a few days' leave from <persName n="Ellison,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00112.00418" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>, and to return to her within the hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/><persName n="Ellison,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00112.00419" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>, however, to whom I preferred my request for a few days' liberty, affected to regard me as though I had uttered something very outrageous, and curtly told me I <quote>might go to the D-----, if I liked, and stay with him for good.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>Such an offensive reply, a few months earlier, would have made me shrink into myself; but the New Orleans atmosphere ripens <num value="1">one</num>'s sense of independence and personal dignity, and I replied with something of the spirit that I had admired in <persName n="Kennicy,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00112.00420" reg="mostcommon:Kennicy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kennicy</surname></persName> and <persName n="Richardson,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00112.00421" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName>, and said:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/> <quote>Very well, sir. You may discharge me at once!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/></quote> Of course, to a person of <persName n="Ellison,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00112.00422" reg="mostcommon:Ellison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ellison</surname></persName>'s sanguinary hair and complexion, the answer was sufficient to ensure my furious dismissal on the instant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was greatly vexed at my action when she heard of it, but consoled me by saying that a few days' liberty would do me no harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>My whole time was now placed at her disposal, and I had reason to know that my humble services were a considerable relief and assistance to her at this trying time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>Meanwhile, poor <persName n="Stanley,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0008.00112.00423" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName> was becoming steadily worse; and, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, her case was reported to be desperate by the physician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>There was no more sleep for any of us until the issue should be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>Near <time value="12am">midnight</time>, <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, with a solemn and ghastly face, beckoned me into the sick lady's room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>With my heart throbbing painfully, and expecting I know not what, I entered on tiptoe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>I saw a broad bed, curtained with white muslin, whereon lay the fragile figure of the patient, so frail and delicate that, in my rude health, it seemed insolence in me to be near her. It had been easy for me to speak of illness when I knew so little of what it meant; but, on regarding its ravages, and observing the operation of death, I stood as <num value="1">one</num> petrified.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> pushed me gently to the bedside, and I saw by the dim light how awfully solemn a human face can be when in saintly peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>Slowly, I understood how even the most timid woman could smilingly welcome Death, and willingly yield herself to its cold embrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>I had hitherto a stony belief that those who died had only been conquered through a sheer <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>want of will on their part ( <quote>All men think all men mortal but themselves.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/><note anchored="yes"> 
<p>Young.</p></note> and that the monster, with its horrors of cold, damp earth, and worms, needed only to be defied to be defeated of its prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>While listening at the door, I had wished that, in some way, I could transfuse a portion of my fulness of spirit into her, that she might have the force to resist the foe; for, surely, with a little more courage, she would not abandon husband, friends, and admirers, for the still company in the <name>Churchyard</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>But the advance of Death was not like that of a blustering tyrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>It was imperceptible, and inconceivably subtle, beginning with a little ache &mdash; like <num value="1">one</num> of many known before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>Before it had declared its presence, it had narcotized the faculties, eased the beats of the heart, lessened the flow of blood, weakened the pulse; it had sent its messenger, Peace, before it, to dispel all anxieties and regrets, and to elevate the soul with the hope of Heaven; and then it closed the valves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>She opened her mild eyes, and spoke words as from afar: <quote>Be a good boy. <name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>And, while I strained my hearing for more, there was an indistinct murmur, the eyes opened wide and became fixed, and a beautiful tranquillity settled over the features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>How strangely serene!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>When I turned to look into <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s eyes, I knew Death had come.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>By a curious coincidence, <persName n="Stanley,Captain,,,," id="n0103.0008.00113.00424" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, her brother-in-law, arrived from <placeName reg="Montour Falls, Schuyler, New York" key="tgn,2070618">Havana</placeName> the next day, in a brig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>He knew nothing of me. There was no reason he should be tender to my feelings, and he intimated to me, with the frankness of a ship's captain, that he would take charge of everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>Even <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> subsided before this strong man; and, being very miserable, and with a feeling of irretrievable loss, I withdrew, after a silent clasp of the hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>About <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> later I received a letter from <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, saying that the body had been embalmed, and the casket had been put in lead; and that, according to a telegram received from <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00113.00425" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, she was going up the river to <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> with it, by the steamer <quote><placeName key="tgn,7017545" n="1.000 120" reg="natchez, adams, mississippi">Natchez</placeName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>For a period, I was too forlorn to heed anything greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>I either stayed at home, reading, or brooding over the last scene in <persName n="Stanley,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0008.00113.00426" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s chamber, or I wandered aimlessly about the levee, or crossed over to <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName>, where I sat on the hulks, and <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>watched the river flowing, with a feeling as of a nightmare on me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>My unhappy experiences at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> had not been without their lessons of prudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>My only extravagances so far had been in the purchase of books; and, even then, a vague presentiment of want had urged me to be careful, and hurry to raise a shield against the afflictions of the destitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>Though at liberty, there was no fear that I should abuse it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>By and by, the cloud lifted from my mind; and I set about seeking for work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>Fortune, however, was not so kind this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>The <rs>Mr. Stanleys</rs> of the world are not numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>After <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> diligent search, there was not a vacancy to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Then I lowered my expectations, and sought for work of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>I descended to odd jobs, such as the sawing of wood, and building wood-piles for private families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>The quality of the work mattered little.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/><num value="1">One</num> day there came a mate to our boarding-house, who told me that his captain was ill, and required an attendant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>I offered myself, and was accepted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>The vessel was the <quote><persName n="Dido,,,,," id="n0103.0008.00114.00427" reg="mostcommon:Dido,nomatch:0"><surname>Dido</surname></persName>,</quote> a full-sized brig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>The captain suffered from a bilious fever, aggravated by dysentery, from drinking <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> water, it was thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>He was haggard, and yellow as saffron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>I received my instructions from the doctor, and committed them to paper to prevent mistakes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>My duties were light and agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>During the remission of fever, the captain proved to be a kindly and pious soul; and his long grey beard gave him a patriarchal appearance, and harmonized with his patient temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>For <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> we had an anxious time over him, but, during the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, he showed signs of mending, and took the air on the poop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>He became quite communicative with me, and had extracted from me mostly all that was worth relating of my short history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>At the end of a month I was relieved from my duties; and as I had no desire to resume sea-life, even with so good a man, I was paid off most handsomely, with a small sum as a <quote>token of regard.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>As I was about to depart, he said some words which, uttered with all solemnity, were impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/><quote>Don't be down-hearted at this break in the beginning of your life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>If you will only have patience, and continue in well-doing, your future will be better than you dream of. You have uncommon <pb id="p.115" n="115"/>faculties, and I feel certain that, barring accidents, you will some day be a rich man. If I were you, I would seek your friend at <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and what you cannot find in this city, you may find in that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>You deserve something better than to be doing odd jobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>Good-bye, and take an old man's best wishes.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>The old captain's words were better than his gold, for they gave me a healthful stimulus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>His gold was not to be despised, but his advice inspired me with hope, and I lifted my head, and fancied I saw clearer and further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>All men must pass through the bondage of necessity before they emerge into life and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>The bondage to <num value="1">one</num>'s parents and guardians is succeeded by bondage to <num value="1">one</num>'s employers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>On the very next day I took a passage for <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, by the steamer <quote><placeName reg="Tuscarora, Livingston, New York" key="tgn,2072786">Tuscarora</placeName></quote> ; and, by the end of <dateStruct value="1859-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, I reached that busy city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>The voyage had proved to me wonderfully educative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>The grand pictures of enterprise, activity, and growing cities presented by the river shores were likely to remain with me forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>The successive revelations of scenery and human life under many aspects impressed me with the extent of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>Mental exclamations of <quote>What a river!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/><quote>What a multitude of steamers!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/><quote>What towns, and what a people!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>greeted each new phase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>The intensity of everything also surprised me, from the resistless and deep river, the driving force within the rushing boats, the galloping drays along the levees, to the hurried pace of everybody ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>On our own steamer my nerves tingled incessantly with the sound of the fast-whirling wheels, the energy of the mates, and the clamour of the hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>A feverish desire to join in the bustle burned in my veins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>On inquiring at the <rs type="place">Planters' Hotel</rs>, I extracted from the hotel clerk the news that <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0008.00115.00428" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName> had descended to New Orleans on business a week before!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>For about <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> I hunted for work along the levee, and up and down <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>, and the principal streets, but without success; and, at last, with finances reduced to a very low ebb, the river, like a magnet, drew me towards it. I was by this time shrunk into a small compass, even to my own perception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>Self-depreciation could scarcely have become lower.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>Wearied and disheartened, I sat down near a number of flatboats and barges, several of which were loading, or loaded, <pb id="p.116" n="116"/>with timber, boards, and staves; and the talk of the men,--rough-bearded fellows,--about me, was of oak, hickory, pine shingles, scantling, and lumber; and I heard the now familiar names of <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>At the last word, my attention was aroused, and I discovered that <num value="1">one</num> of the flat-boats was just about to descend the river to that port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Its crew were seated on the lumber, yarning lightheartedly; and their apparent indifference to care was most attractive to an outcast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>I stole nearer to them, found out the boss, and, after a while, offered to work my passage down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>Something in me must have excited his rough sympathy, for he was much kinder than might have been expected from his rough exterior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>I had long since learned that the ordinary <rs>American</rs> was a curious compound of gentleman and navvy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>His garb and speech might be rough, his face and hands soiled, beard and hair unkempt, but the bearing was sure to be free, natural, and grand, and his sentiments becoming; the sense of manly dignity was never absent, and his manners corresponded with his situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>My services were accepted, not without receiving a hint that loafing could not be tolerated aboard a flat-boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>Being the youngest on board, I was to be a general helper, assist the cook, and fly about where wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>But what a joy to the workless is occupation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>Independence may be a desirable thing, but the brief taste I had had of it had, by this, completely sickened me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>We cast off at day-break, and committed our huge unwieldy boat to the current of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, using our sweeps occasionally to keep her in the middle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>For the most part it seemed to me a lazy life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>The physical labours were almost nil, though, now and then, all hands were called to exert their full strength, and the shouting and swearing were terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>When the excitement was passed, we subsided into quietude, smoking, sleeping, and yarning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>A rude galley had been set up temporarily for the cook's convenience, and a sail was stretched over the middle of the boat as a shelter from the sun and rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>There were <num value="11">eleven</num> of us altogether, including myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>My promiscuous duties kept me pretty busy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>I had to peel potatoes, stir mush, carry water, wash tin pans, and scour the plates, and on occasions lend my strength at pulling <num value="1">one</num> of the tremendously long oars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/><pb id="p.117" n="117"/></p> 
<p>No special incident occurred during the long and tedious voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>Once we narrowly escaped being run down by the <q direct="unspecified">Empress</q> steamer, and we had a lively time of it, the angry men relieving themselves freely of threats and oaths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>Steamers passed us every day. Sometimes a pair of them raced madly side by side, or along opposite banks, while their furnaces, fed by pitch-pine, discharged rolling volumes of thick smoke, which betrayed, for hours after they had disappeared from view, the course they had taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The water would splash up the sides of our boat, and the yellow river would part into alarming gulfs on either hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>On the whole, the flat-boatmen had been singularly decent in their behaviour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>Their coarseness was not disproportionate to their circumstances, or what might be expected from wage-earners of their class; but what impressed me most was the vast amount of good feeling they exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>There had been a few exciting tussles, and some sharp exchanges of bellicose talk between the principals, but their bitterness vanished in a short time, while, towards myself, they were more like protectors than employers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>Nevertheless, a few painful truths had been forced on my notice; I had also gained valuable experience of the humours of rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>The fluvial moods had considerably interested me. The play of currents, eddies, and whirlpools afforded inexhaustible matter for observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>The varying aspects of the stream in calm and storm, when deep or shallow, in the neighbourhood of snags, sandbars, and spits, reflecting sunshine or leaden sky, were instructive, and the veteran flat-boatmen were not averse to satisfying my inquisitiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>Being naturally studious and reflective, I carried away with me far more than I could rehearse of what was of practical value; but, boy-like, I relegated my impressions to memory, where, in process of time, they could be solidified into knowledge. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>My shore-clothes restored me to the semblance of my former self, and, with many a protest of good &mdash; will from my late companions, I walked towards the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>In a few hours I reached <address><street n="St. Charles Street">St. Charles Street</street></address>, and, as though wearied with its persecution of me, Fortune brought me into the presence of <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0009.00118.00429" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>His reception of me was so paternal that the prodigal son could not have been more delighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>My absence from New Orleans had but intensified my affection for the only friend I seemed to possess in all <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>Once out of his presence, I felt as a stranger among strangers; on re-entering it, I became changed outwardly and inwardly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Away from him, I was at once shy, silent, morosely severe; with him, I was exuberantly glad, and chatted freely, without fear of repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>Since we had parted, I had met some <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and spoken with a few hundreds; but no <num value="1">one</num> had kindled in me the least spark of personal interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>It may, then, be understood how my greeting expressed my sense of his preeminence and rarity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Between the last sentence and what follows, there should be an interval represented by many * * * * * *. I do not know how it came about, but I was suddenly fixed immovably, for a period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>Preoccupied with my bursting gladness, I had observed nothing but our mutual gratification; and then I had poured my tale of woes unchecked, except by an expression of sympathy, now and again, from him. But, presently, after some commonplaces, his words sounded a deeper note, and stirred my innermost being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>A peculiar sensation &mdash; as though the wind of a strong breathing was flowing down my back, and ran up with a refluent motion to the head, blowing each hair apart &mdash; came over me, and held me spellbound and thrilled to the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/><hi rend="italics">He was saying, with some</hi> <pb id="p.119" n="119"/><hi rend="italics">emotion, that my future should be his charge</hi>! He had been so powerfully affected by what <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> had told him, with all the warmth of her <name>Irish</name> nature, of the last scene at the deathbed of his wife, that he had been unable to dissociate me from his thoughts of her; he had wondered what I was doing, what had become of me, imagined that I was starving, and, knowing how friendless and unsophisticated I was, each conjecture had been dismal and pitiful; and he had resolved, on reaching New Orleans, to make diligent search for me, and take me to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>While he related his extraordinary intentions, it seemed to me as if my spirit was casting an interested regard upon my own image, and was glorying in the wonderful transformation that was taking place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>To think that any man should be weaving such generous designs upon a person so unworthy and insignificant as myself, and plotting a felicitous future for me, nursed in contumely and misery, seemed to me to be too wonderful for belief!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>Then, again, there was a certain mysterious coincidence about it which awed me. In my earliest dreams and fancies, I had often imagined what kind of a boy I should be with a father or mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>What ecstasy it would be if my parent came to me, to offer a parent's love, as I had enviously seen it bestowed on other children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>In my secret prayers, something of a wish of this kind had been behind the form of words; and now, as an answer from the <name>Invisible</name>, came this astounding revelation of His power!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>He had cast a little leaven of kindness into the heart of a good man. From the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encounter, it had acted beneficially for me and now it had leavened his whole nature, until it had become a fatherly affection, which would shield my youth from trial and temptation, and show me the best side of human nature!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>Before I could quite grasp all that this declaration meant for me, he had risen, taken me by the hand, and folded me in a gentle embrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>My senses seemed to whirl about for a few half-minutes: and, finally, I broke down, sobbing from extreme emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>It was the only tender action I had ever known, and, what no amount of cruelty could have forced from me, tears poured in a torrent under the influence of the simple embrace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The golden period of my life began from that supreme <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>moment!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>As I glance back at it from the present time, it seems more like a dream, as unreal as a vision of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>Compared with these matter-of-fact days, or the ruthless past, it was like a masquerade among goodly felicities and homely affections, and its happy experiences have been too precious and sacred for common chat, though they have lain near enough for the fitting occasion, moulded and ready for utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>They have formed my best memories, and furnished me with an unfading store of reflections, and, probably, have had more influence than any other upon my conduct and manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>For, to be lifted out of the depths of friendlessness and destitution to a paternal refuge, and made the object of care and solicitude so suddenly, at a time, too, when I was most impressionable, without an effort on my own part, and without an advocate, bordered on the miraculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>Predisposed to inward communing, with a strong but secret faith in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, I regarded it as principally the result of a Divine interposition, the course of which was a mystery not to be lightly talked of, but to be remembered for its significance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>After a restful night, and when breakfast had been despatched, we adjourned to a room used as an office and sitting apartment, and there I was subjected to a sympathetic cross-examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>Every incident of my life, even to the fancies that had fled across the mind of callow boyhood, was elicited with the assistance of his searching questions, and then I was, as it were, turned completely inside out. <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0009.00120.00430" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName> said that what I had told him only bore out the conclusion he had long before arrived at concerning me. He had suspected that I was an orphan, or <num value="1">one</num> who had been flatly disowned, and a waif exposed to every wind of Chance; and he was glad that it had deposited me in his keeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>He expressed amazement that helpless children were treated so unfeelingly in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and marvelled that no <num value="1">one</num> cared to claim them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>Being a childless man, he and his wife had often prayed for the blessing of offspring, until they were wearied with desiring and expecting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>Then they had gone to the <rs>Faubourg St. Mary</rs>, and had visited the <rs>Infant Asylum</rs>, with the view of adopting some unclaimed child; but they had made no choice, from over-fastidiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>It much surprised him that none of my <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>relations had discovered in me what had struck him and <persName n="Speake,,,,," id="n0103.0009.00121.00431" reg="mostcommon:Speake,James,,,:5"><surname>Speake</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Had he searched New Orleans all through, he said, he could not have found <num value="1">one</num> who would have shared his views respecting me with more sympathy than his friend; and, had <persName n="Speake,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0009.00121.00432" reg="mostcommon:Speake,James,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Speake</surname></persName> lived, he added, I should have been as good as established for life.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>Then, at some length, he related the circumstances which had induced him to take a warmer interest in me. He had often thought of the start I had given him by the question, <quote>Do you want a boy, sir?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>It seemed to voice his own life-long wish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>But he thought I was too big for his purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>For the sake, however, of the long-desired child, he determined to do the best he could for me, and had obtained my engagement with his friend <persName n="Speake,,,,," id="n0103.0009.00121.00436" reg="mostcommon:Speake,James,,,:5"><surname>Speake</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>When he had gone home, his wife had been much interested in the adventure with me, and had often asked how his <quote>protege</quote> was getting on?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>When she had, finally, seen me, she had said something to him which had given a new turn to his thoughts; but, as I was already established, and was likely to succeed, he had ceased thinking about it. On <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>'s arrival at <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> with his wife's remains, she had been so eloquent in all the details of what had occurred, that he inwardly resolved that his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object on reaching the city should be to seek me and undertake what <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had pointed out to him; namely, to educate me for the business of life, and be to me what my father should have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/><quote>The long and the short of it is,</quote> said he, <quote>as you are wholly unclaimed, without a parent, relation, or sponsor, I promise to take you for my son, and fit you for a mercantile career; and, in future, <hi rend="italics">you are to bear my name, <quote><persName n="Stanley,,Henry,,," id="n0103.0009.00121.00437" reg="default:Stanley,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>.</quote></hi></quote> Having said which, he rose, and, dipping his hands in a basin of water, he made the sign of the cross on my forehead, and went seriously through the formula of baptism, ending with a brief exhortation to bear my new name worthily.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>In answer, as it might seem, to the least shade of doubt on <pb id="p.122" n="122"/>my face, which he thought he observed, he gave me a brief summary of his own life, from which I learned that he had not always been a merchant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>He told me that he had been educated for the ministry, and had been ordained, and for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> had preached in various places between <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>; but, finally, becoming lukewarm, he had lost his original enthusiasm for his profession, and had turned his attention to commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>Intimacy with men of business, and social life, had led him by degrees to consider himself unfitted for a calling which seemed to confine his natural activities; but, though he had lost the desire to expound the <rs>Christian</rs> faith from the pulpit, he had not lost his principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>The greater gains of commerce had seemed to him to be more attractive than the work of persuading men and women to be devout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>After <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> unsuccessful essays as a storekeeper, he had finally adopted a commission business, and had succeeded in several profitable ventures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>He thought that, in a few years, he would return to the store business, and settle in <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">one</num> of the back-country places</q> for which he had a great hankering; but, at present, he could not make up his mind to terminate his city connections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>Much else he related to me, for it was a day of revelations; but to me, personally, it mattered little &mdash; it was quite sufficient that he was he, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, best friend, my benefactor, my father!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Only the close student of the previous pages could compass my feelings at finding the <num value="1">one</num> secret wish of my heart gratified so unexpectedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>To have an unbreathed, unformed wish plucked out of the silence, and fashioned into a fact as real as though my dead father had been restored to life and claimed me, was a marvel so great that I seemed to be divided into <num value="2">two</num> individuals--<num value="1">one</num> strenuously denying that such a thing could be, and the other arraying all the proofs of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>It was even more of a wonder than that <persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n0103.0009.00122.00438" reg="mostcommon:Dick,nomatch:0"><surname>Dick</surname></persName> the boy should be transformed into <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> the girl!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>But when hour after hour passed, and each brought its substantial evidence of the change, the disturbed faculties gradually returned to their normal level, though now more susceptible to happiness than when existence was <num value="1">one</num> series of mortifications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>As we walked the streets together, many a citizen must have guessed by my glowing face and shining eyes that I was <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>brimful of joy. I began to see a new beauty in everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>The men seemed pleasanter, the women more gracious, the atmosphere more balmy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>It was only by severe suppression that I was able to restrain myself from immoderate behaviour, and breaking out into hysteric and unseemly ebullience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>A gush of animal enjoyment in life, from this date, would sometimes overtake me, and send me through the streets at the rate of a professional pedestrian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>I would open my mouth and drink the air, with deep disdain for all physical weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>I had to restrain the electrical vitality, lest the mad humour for leaping over a dray or cart might awaken the suspicion of the policeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>On such days, and during such fits, it was indeed joy to be alive,--<quote>but to be young was very Heaven.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Most of the day was spent in equipping me for the new position I was to assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>I was sumptuously furnished with stylish suits, new linen, collars, flannels, low-quarter shoes, and kip<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>It had never entered my head, before, that teeth should be brushed, or that a nail-brush was indispensable, or that a night-dress contributed to health and comfort!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>When we returned to <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0009.00123.00439" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s boarding-house, we had a pleasant time in the arrangement of the piles of new garments and accessories, and in practising the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons in the art of personal decoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>In <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName> the inhabitants considered it unbecoming in <num value="1">one</num> who aspired to manliness to ape the finicky niceties of women, and to be too regardful of <num value="1">one</num>'s personal appearance; and had they heard my new father descant so learnedly on the uses of tooth-and <rs n="nail brushes" type="product">nail-brushes</rs>, I feel sure they would have turned away with grimaces and shrugs of dissatisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>What would stern <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> have said, had she viewed this store of clothing and linen that was destined for the use of a boy whom, at <num value="1">one</num> time, she had seriously meditated indenturing to a cobbler?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>But, previous to the assumption of my new habiliments, I was conducted to a long bath, set in a frame of dark wood, and, while looking at it, and wondering at its splendour, I heard so many virtues ascribed to its daily use that I contracted quite a love for it, and vowed to myself that since it <pb id="p.124" n="124"/>appeared to be a panacea for so many ills, all that scented soap and scrubbing could effect would be gladly tested by me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>I steeped myself that afternoon, as though I would wash out the stains ugly poverty and misery had impressed upon my person since infancy; and, when I emerged out of the bath, my self-esteem was as great as befitted the name and character I was hereafter to assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>But there was much to improve inwardly as well as outwardly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>The odium attached to the old name, and its dolorous history, as it affected my sense of it, could not be removed by water, but by diligent application to a moral renovation, and making use of the new life, with the serious intent to hold the highest ideal I knew of, as my exemplar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>To aid me in my endeavours, my new father was gentleness itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, he made no great demand on me; but our intercourse was permitted to grow to that familiar intimacy which inspired perfect confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>There was no fear that I could ever be contemptuous or disrespectful; but, had he not allowed a certain time for familiarising me with his presence and position towards me, I might not have been able to overcome a natural timidity which would have ill-suited our connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>When I had learned to touch him without warning, and yet receive a genial welcome, laugh in his presence unchecked, and even comb his beard with my fingers, then I came completely out of my shell; and, after that, development was rapid.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>The rule was now agreeably reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>I was encouraged to speak upon every occasion, and to utter my opinions regardless of age and sex. No incident occurred, and no subject was mentioned, that I was not invited to say what I thought of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Apart from commercial and cognate details, I think my ripening understanding was made more manifest in anything relating to human intercourse and human nature, owing, probably, to the greater efforts made by my father to assist me in recovering lost ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>I had had no home, and therefore I was singularly deficient in the little graces of home life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Unconsciously to myself, from the <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>moment I had stepped out of the bath-room in my new garments, I began that elementary education which was to render me fit to be seen by the side of a respectable man.

Being attentive and intelligent, acute of hearing, quick of eye-sight, and with a good memory, I had gained immensely in my father's estimation, and he was, to me, a sufficient judge.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>Our wanderings from city to city, steamer to steamer, and store to store, which the business of my father necessitated, I do not propose to dwell upon; in fact, it would be impossible to contain within a volume all that I remember of this, and subsequent periods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>During nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, we travelled several times between New Orleans, <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>; but most of our time was spent on the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">lower</rs> Mississippi</placeName> tributaries, and on the shores of the <placeName reg="Ouachita River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021027">Washita</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2769106;tgn,2638211" n="0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2769106;Whittington, Hot Spring, Arkansas,Hot Spring,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;0.114 000000.2273	placename;tgn,2638211;Saline River, Grant, Arkansas,Grant,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="Whittington, Hot Spring, Arkansas,Hot Spring,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;Saline River, Grant, Arkansas,Grant,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America">Saline</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019842">Arkansas Rivers</placeName>, as the more profitable commissions were gained in dealings with country merchants between <placeName reg="Harrisonburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2112170">Harrisonburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2007622" n="1.000 10" reg="arkadelphia, clark, arkansas">Arkadelphia</placeName>, and between <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0103.0009.00125.00440" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Little Rock, Pulaski, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013897">Little Rock</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>From these business tours I acquired a better geographical knowledge <pb id="p.126" n="126"/>than any amount of school-teaching would have given me; and at <num value="1">one</num> time I was profound in the statistics relating to population, commerce, and navigation of the <rs>Southern</rs> and South-Western States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>Just as <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n0103.0009.00126.00441" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName> was said to be remarkable for being able to know a book from beginning to end by merely turning over its pages, I was considered a prodigy by my father and his intimate friends for the way names and faces clung to my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>I could tell the name of every steamer we had passed, the characteristics of her structure, and every type of man we met. A thing viewed, or a subject discussed likely to be useful, became impressed indelibly on the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>Probably this mental acquisitiveness was stimulated by the idea that it formed the equipment of a merchant, which I believed it was my ultimate destiny to be; and that every living man should be a living gazetteer, and possess facts and figures at his fingers' ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>Meantime, my memory was frequently of great use to my father as an auxiliary to his memorandum-book of shipments, purchases, and sales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>Once having seen the page, I could repeat its record with confidence; and I was often rewarded by his admiring exclamation, <quote>Well, I never heard the like!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>It is perfectly astonishing how you remember details,</quote> etc. But, though eyes and ears and technical memory were well exercised, it was some time before judgement was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Understanding was slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>It took long for me to perceive wherein lay the superiority of <num value="1">one</num> sugar over another, or why <num value="1">one</num> grade of flour fetched a higher price than another, or wherein <rs n="bourbon whiskey" type="product">Bourbon whiskey</rs> was superior to rye, and to distinguish the varying merits of coffees, teas, etc. What a man said, or how he looked, his dress, appearance, and so on, were ineffaceable; but the unwritten, or untold, regarding him was a blank to me; and when I heard comments from bystanders upon the nature of some person, I used to wonder how they formed their opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>However, the effect of these criticisms upon men and their manners was to inspire me with a desire to penetrate beneath, and to school myself in comparing different people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>I had abundance of opportunities, in the multitudes we met in the crowded steamers, and the many towns we visited; but that which would have given the key to the mystery was wanting, viz., personal intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>In the absence of direct conversation and dealings with people, <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>it was difficult to discover the nature of a spirit lurking under a fair outside.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>When we left New Orleans, at the end of <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, we had brought with us a portmanteau packed with choice literature, and I was given to understand that the histories of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, and America, poetry and drama, were especially for my use, and that I was to pursue my studies as diligently as at a school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>The practice of travel enabled my father to dispose himself comfortably for the indulgence of reading, within a very short time after reaching his cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>He acted as <num value="1">one</num> who had only changed his room, and was only concerned with his own business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>With such a man, a river-voyage was no impediment to instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>He set me an example of application to my book, which, added to my own love of study, enabled me to cultivate indifference to what was passing outside of our cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>Our travelling library was constantly replenished at the large cities, with essays, memoirs, biographies, and general literature; but novels and romances were rigidly excluded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taught me how a book should be read aloud, and, in a few seconds, had corrected a sing-song intonation which was annoying to him. He said that <num value="1">one</num> could almost tell whether a reader understood his author by the tone of his delivery; and, taking up a Shakespeare, he illustrated it by reading, <quote>Who steals my purse steals trash,</quote> etc.; and the various styles he adopted were well calculated to enforce his lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>From the monotone I was unable to see any beauty or point in the quotation; but, when he assumed the tone of the moralist, the lines certainly set me thinking, and the truth of the sentiments appeared so clear that I was never able to forget the quotation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Sometimes, also, when reading aloud a page of history, I would come to a dull paragraph, and my attention would flag; but he was quick to detect this, and would compel me to begin again, because he was sure that I knew not what I had been reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>I merely note this because during <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> we read together a large number of books; and, as I had the benefit of his disquisitions and comments on my reading, it will be seen that with such a companion these river-voyages considerably advanced my education, as much so, indeed, as <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>though I had been with a tutor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>Nor, when we dropped our books, and promenaded the deck, was my mind left to stagnate in frivolity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>He took advantage of every object worthy of notice to impress on me some useful, or moral lesson,--to warn me against errors of omission, or commission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Whatever it may have been in my personal appearance that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attracted him to me, it is certain that the continued affection he always showed towards me was secured by my zealous efforts always to follow his slightest suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>I think it would have been difficult to have found a boy in the neighbourhood of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> who observed his parent's wishes with a more scrupulous exactitude than I did those of my adopted father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>As I came to have an entire knowledge of him, I knew not which to admire most, the unvarying, affectionate interest he showed in my personal welfare, or his merits as a man and moral guardian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>Being of original ideas, acute mind, and impressive in speech, the matter of his conversation glued itself into my memory, and stirred me to thought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>I remember well when, <num value="1">one</num> day, he revealed something of the method he proposed to follow with me for the perfecting of my commercial education, I expressed a doubt as to whether, after all his trouble and care, I would ever come up to his expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>I said that as to carrying out plain instructions with all good &mdash; will there need be no fear &mdash; I loved work, and the approbation given to fidelity and industry; but, when I contemplated being left to my own judgement, I felt strong misgivings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>How admirably he interpreted my thoughts, explained my doubts!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>He infused me with such confidence that, had a store been given me there and then, I should have instantly accepted its management!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/><quote>But,</quote> he said, <quote> I am not going to part with you yet. You have much to learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>You are a baby in some things yet, because you have been only a few months in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>By the time I have wound up matters, you will have learned <num value="1000">thousands</num> of little trifles, and will be so grounded in solid knowledge that you may safely be trusted under another merchant to learn the minutiae of business, and so get ready to keep store with me.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>I suggested to him that I laboured under disadvantages such as hampered very few other boys, which would act as a <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>clog on the free exercise of my abilities, and that, even if other people refrained from alluding to my Parish breeding, the memory of it would always have a depressing effect on me. But such thoughts he met with something like angry contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/><quote>I don't know,</quote> said he, <quote>what the custom of the <name>Welsh</name> people may be, but <hi rend="italics">here</hi> we regard personal character and worth, not pedigree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>With us, people are advanced, not for what their parentage may have been, but for what they are themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>All whom I meet in broadcloth have risen through their own efforts, and not because they were their father's children.

We put a premium on the proper exercise of every faculty, and guarantee to every man full freedom to better himself in any way he chooses, provided always he does not exercise it at the expense of the rights of other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>It is only those who refuse to avail themselves of their opportunities, and shamefully abuse them, that we condemn.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>At other times, the vehemence of youth would frequently betray itself; and, if I had not been checked, I should probably have developed undue loquacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>Being of sanguine temper by nature, I was led through gushes of healthy rapture into excesses of speech; but he would turn on me, and gravely say that he was not accustomed to carry magnifiers with him; that, owing to his own sense of proportion, my figures gave him no true idea of the fact I wished to state, that my free use of unnecessary ciphers only created confusion in his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>Sometimes he would assume a comical look of incredulity, which brought me to my senses very quickly, and made me retract what I had said, and repeat the statement with a more sacred regard for accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/><quote>Just so,</quote> he would say; <quote>if a thing is worth stating at all, it might as well be stated truly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>A boy's fancy is very warm, I know; but, if once he acquires the habit of multiplying his figures, every fact will soon become no better than a fable.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>Being an early riser himself, he insisted on my cultivating the habit of rising at dawn, but he also sent me to bed at an early hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>He lost no occasion to urge me to apply the morning hours to study; and, really, his anxiety that I should <pb id="p.130" n="130"/>snatch the flying minutes appeared to be so great, that I was often infected with it as though they were something tangible, but so elusive that only a firm grasp would avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>If he saw me idly gazing on the shores, he would recall me, to ask if I had finished some chapter we had been discussing, or if I had found a different answer to his question than I had last given; and, if he detected an inclination in me to listen to the talk of passengers round the bar, he would ask if there were no books in the cabin, that I must needs hanker for the conversation of idlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/><quote>All the babble of these topers, if boiled down,</quote> he would say, <quote>would not give a drachm of useful knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>Greatness never sprang from such fruitless gossip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Those men were merely wasting time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>From motives of selfishness, they, no doubt, would be glad to exchange trivial talk with anyone, big or little, who might come near them, but it was not to my interest to be in their company.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>He would put his arm in mine, and lead me away to deliver himself of his thoughts on the glory of youth, painting it in such bright colours that, before long, I would be seized with a new idea of its beauty and value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>It appeared to be only a brief holiday, which ought to be employed for the strengthening of muscles, gathering the flowers of knowledge, and culling the riper fruits of wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Youth was, really, only the period for gaining strength of bone, to endure the weight put on it by manhood, and for acquiring that largeness of mind necessary to understand the ventures I should hereafter be compelled to take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>To squander it among such fellows as congregated around bar-rooms and liquor-counters was as foolish as to open my veins to let out my life-blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/><quote>Now is the time to prepare for the long voyage you are to take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>You have seen the ships in the docks taking in their stores before leaving for the high sea where nothing can be bought.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>The sight in the steamer saloons of crowds of excited gamblers <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>was employed by him in exposition of his views on the various ways of acquiring wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Those piles of golden eagles that glittered on the table of the saloon would enrich none of the gamblers permanently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>Money obtained by such methods always melted away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>Wealth was made by industry and economy, and not by gambling or speculating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>To know how to be frugal was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step towards a fortune, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was to practice frugality, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> step was to know what to do with the money saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>It was every man's duty to put something aside each day, were it only a few cents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>No man in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> was paid such low wages that, if he were determined, he could not put away half of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>A man's best friend, after <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, was himself; and, if he could not rely on himself, he could not rely on anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty was to himself, as he was bound to his own wants all his life, and must provide for them under every circumstance; if he neglected to provide for his own needs, he would always be unable to do anything towards the need of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>Then, as his custom was, he would proceed to apply these remarks to my case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>I was to retain in my mind the possibility of being again homeless, and friendless, and adrift in the world, the world keeping itself to itself, and barring the door against me, as it did at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, New Orleans, and <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, <quote>The poor man is hated, even by his own neighbour; but the rich man has many friends,</quote> etc., etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>An original method of instruction which he practised with me was to present me different circumstances, and ask me what I would do. These were generally difficult cases, wherein honesty, honour, and right-doing, were involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>No sooner had I answered, than he would press me with another view of it, wherein it appeared that his view was just as fair as the <num value="1">one</num> I had; and he would so perplex me that I would feel quite foolish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>For instance, a fellow-clerk of mine was secretly dishonest, but was attached to me in friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>He made free with his employer's till, and <num value="1">one</num> day was discovered by me alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>What would I do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>I would dissuade him. But supposing, despite his promises to you, he was still continuing to abstract small sums: what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>I would accuse him of it, and say to him he was a thief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>Supposing that, seeing you could give no positive proof of his theft, he denied it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Then <pb id="p.132" n="132"/>he would be a liar, too, and there would be a quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>And what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>That is all. What of the employer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>In what way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>Is he not in question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>does he not pay you for looking after his interests?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>But I do look after his interests, in trying to prevent the theft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>And yet, with all your care of his interests, the pilfering goes on, and nobody knows it but you. You think, then, that I ought to tell on him, and ruin him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>Well, when you engaged with your employer, did you not make something of a bargain with him, that, for a certain wage, you would make his interests your own, and keep him duly informed of all that was going on?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> example of the painstaking way in which he would stir up my reasoning powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>When we walked through the streets, he would call my attention to the faces of the passers-by, and would question me as to what professions or trades they belonged to; and, when I replied that I could not guess them, he would tell me that my eyes were the lamps to my feet, and the guides to my understanding, and would show me that though I might not guess accurately each time, in many instances I might arrive at the truth, and that, whether wrong or right, the attempt to do so was an exercise of the intellect, and would greatly tend, in time, to sharpen my wits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Moral resistance was a favourite subject with him. He said the practice of it gave vigour to the will, which required it as much as the muscles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>The will required to be strengthened to resist unholy desires and low passions, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the best allies that conscience could have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Conscience was a good friend, and the more frequently I listened to it, the more ready it was with its good offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Conscience was the sense of the soul; and, just as the senses of smell and taste guarded my body from harm or annoyance, it guarded the spirit from evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>It was very tender and alert now, because I was yet at school and the influence of the <name>Scriptures</name> was strong in me; but, when neglected, it became dull and insensitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Those, however, who paid heed to it grew to feel the sensation of its protective presence, and, upon the least suspicion of evil, it strenuously summoned the will to its aid, and thus it was that temptations were resisted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>Whether afloat or ashore, his manners were so open and <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>genial, that <num value="1">one</num> would think he courted acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Many people, led by this, were drawn to accost him; but no man knew better than he, how to relieve himself of undesirable people, and those who enjoyed his company were singularly like himself, in demeanour and conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>It is from the character of his associates that I have obtained my most lasting impressions of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0103.0009.00133.00443" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and, whenever mentioned, these are the figures which always rise <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the mental view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>It was some <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> or so after my adoption that I ventured to broach a subject of more than ordinary interest to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>My ideas respecting the <name>Deity</name> I suspected were too peculiar to trust them to speech; and yet, if someone did not enlighten me, I should remain long in ignorance of the <name>Divine</name> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>True, certain coincidences made me secretly believe that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> heard me; nevertheless, I burned to know from an authoritative source whether I was the victim of illusions, or whether the <name>Being</name> of my conceptions bore any resemblance to that of the learned and old I had met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>My father did not ridicule this idea as I feared he would, and I was much relieved to hear him ask how I had come to form such a fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>This was difficult to express in words, but, at last, I managed to explain that, probably, it was from the verse which said that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had made man after His own image, and because clergymen always looked upward when in church.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>Probably, many a sermon which I had heard had contained them in a diluted form; but they had not been adapted to my understanding, and his clear exposition of these subjects was an immense relief to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>My temper was quick, which, with an excess of false pride, inspired me to the verge of rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>A sense of decency prevented me from any overt act of defiance, but the spirit was not less fierce because I imposed the needful restraint on it. Outwardly, I might be tranquil enough, but my smothered resentment was as wicked and unjustifiable as if I had openly defied him. A choleric disposition on his part would have been as a flame to my nature, and the result might have been guessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>Happily for me, he was consistently considerate, and declined to notice too closely the flushed face, and the angry <pb id="p.138" n="138"/>sparkles of the eye, which betokened revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>An occasional blood-letting might perhaps have been beneficial to me; but he had discovered other methods, just as efficacious, for reducing me to a state of reason, and never once had recourse to threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>My fits of sullenness had been probably provoked by an unexpected sharpness of tone, or a denial of some liberty, or graver censure than I thought I deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>Constrained to silence by the magnitude and character of my obligations to him, I, of course, magnified my grievances; and, the longer reconciliation was deferred, the larger these seemed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>Before this dangerous mood sought vent, some look, a word, some secret transmission of sympathy occurred, and, in an instant, the evil humour vanished; for weeks afterwards, I would endeavour to atone for my churlish behaviour by a contrite submissiveness which was capable of undergoing any penance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>This, in itself, was an education; for I learned, after several experiences, not to disturb myself too seriously because of a temporary change in his manner or mood, and to accept it rather as being due to some cross in business, or physical condition, than to any offence in me, and so the customary cordiality was soon restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>By his method of teaching, no passive reception of facts was possible, and the stimulus to intellect was given by being urged to observe, sift, and examine every article of conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>I absorbed considerable practical knowledge during this period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>His level-headedness, which I was prone to regard at that time as the height of worldly wisdom, and his intense realness, aided greatly to clarify my ideas upon many things, and was excellently adapted to form a sound judgement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>The candour and good faith with which he spoke, the expansive benevolence, and the large amount of sympathy he always showed when I sought his advice, or exposed my doubts or fears, were the very qualities which were best calculated to ensure my affection, extract my shy confidences, and cultivate in me a fearless openness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>With the exception of those fits of sullen resentment to which I was now and then subject, like other human whelps, my life with him was <num value="1">one</num> unbroken period of pleasantness, and, so far as I required and knew, every condition of a Paradise was present, in the unfretting, fair, and healthful existence which I led.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>I endeavoured to be, as the phrase is, good and grateful; but, <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>as I have reason to remember, I was by no means perfect in my endeavours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>We were passengers on the steamer <quote><placeName reg="Little Rock, Pulaski, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013897">Little Rock</placeName>,</quote> as she was returning, laden with cotton, down the <rs>Washita</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>My father had been paid money due to him for goods by a merchant near <placeName key="tgn,2027799" n="1.000 1" reg="fairview, fulton, illinois">Fairview</placeName>, and, through neglect, or some other reason, had deferred entrusting it to the purser longer than he ought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>We were approaching near <placeName reg="Sicily Island, Catahoula, Louisiana" key="tgn,2044022">Sicily Island</placeName>, when, in the gloom caused by the mountain-pile of cotton bales, I observed a man lingering rather suspiciously near our cabin-door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I took him for <num value="1">one</num> of the stewards; but, on observing him more particularly, his conduct, I thought, suggested some nefarious design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>My father had retired, and, according to custom, I ought to have been abed; but the unusual freight of cotton the boat carried had kept me in a state of suppressed excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Being light and active, I ensconced myself in a dark gap between <num value="2">two</num> tiers of bales, and waited patiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>After a little time the man put his ear to our door, and presently opened it, and entered our cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>In a few minutes, I heard my father's voice ask, <quote>Who is there?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>and, immediately, sounds of a struggle were heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>Upon this I bounded in, and found the stranger wrestling with my father, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> seemed to be choking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Upon seeing me, the intruder turned rapidly towards me. I saw the flash as of steel, and something struck me between my arm and left breast in my overcoat, and a piece of metal tinkled on the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>Then, with a deep curse, I was flung aside, and the man fled along the guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>We instantly raised a cry of <quote>Thieves!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>which brought crowds of stewards and passengers to us, carrying lights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>These revealed an open portmanteau, with rumpled contents, and the half of a carving-knife blade on the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>On examining my coat it was seen that it had a cut as far as the canvas stiffening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>All these evidences tended to prove that a daring attempt at robbery had been made, and, it was suspected, by someone connected with the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>The chief steward mustered the waiters, but they all answered <pb id="p.142" n="142"/>to their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>He next counted the carving-knives, and, according to him, <num value="1">one</num> was missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>The incident caused quite a commotion for the time, but the culprit was never discovered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>Beyond this incident, we were singularly free from mishaps, and exciting episodes, upon waters that had been the scene of many a calamity; and yet, when I chanced to find myself among a group of passengers, I frequently heard terrible recitals of experiences at boiler-explosions, and shipwrecks, and other events hazardous to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>We had often been fellow-passengers with gamblers, some of whom were wrought into fury by their losses at cards; but, whether it was owing to my good or evil fortune, I never happened to be present when the issue was left to the arbitrament of revolver and bowie-knife, as there were plenty of peace-makers always ready to interfere at the critical moment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>From what I gathered, he was a <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> by birth, but, some few years since, had removed to <placeName reg="Saline, Arkansas, United States" key="tgn,2000167">Saline County, Arkansas</placeName>, and had established a plantation not far from <placeName reg="Warren, Jo Daviess, Illinois" key="tgn,2030567">Warren</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>My father and he had an abundant amount of small-talk together relating to acquaintances and localities, which occupied their leisure during the voyage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>The <rs>Major</rs> also ingratiated himself with me, and, through his description of the forests of pine and oak, and accounts of the wild animals, such as catamounts, bears, and deer, in his region, I became warmly attached to him. Before reaching New Orleans, we had become so intimate that he extended an invitation to me to spend a month with him on his <placeName reg="Arkansas plantation">Arkansas plantation</placeName>; and, on referring him to father, I found that he was not so averse to the proposal as I feared he would be.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>After about a fortnight's stay at the <rs type="place">St. Charles Hotel</rs>, my father was made anxious by a letter from <placeName reg="Havana, Mason, Illinois" key="tgn,2028231">Havana</placeName> from his brother, and he resolved to go and see him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>For some time he had been debating as to how it would be best to take the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step for establishing <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>my future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>He had been much struck with the opportunities for doing a good business in a country store, at some place below <placeName reg="Pine Bluff, Jefferson, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009230">Pine Bluff</placeName> on the <rs>Arkansas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>There were a large number of planters settled there, and a general supply store such as he had fancied for their convenience could not fail to be a success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>Here was an opportunity of approaching his project in a methodical way without loss of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>His brother's illness at <placeName reg="Havana, Mason, Illinois" key="tgn,2028231">Havana</placeName> had caused some confusion in his affairs, and it was necessary for him to cross the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> and set things in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>Meantime, I had a safe escort to within a day's drive of the merchant's store, to which, after being tired of the plantation, I was to go to be grounded in the minutiae of a retail store; and in a few months he would have wound up his commission business, and be able to avail himself of my local knowledge, and proceed to choose the best locality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>I saw no objection to any of his arrangements, as they rather coincided with my secret ambitions, which had been fostered by many previous allusions to such a scheme as had been now explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>The suddenness of the parting was somewhat of a drawback to the beauty of the project; but, as accident was the cause, and his absence was to be only for a few months, during which we could often correspond, I became inclined, with the sanguineness of my nature, to anticipate much enjoyment from the novelty of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>In my highly-coloured fancy, I saw illimitable pine-woods, infested by <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0103.0010.00143.00448" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, and by wild-cats, and other savage felines; and the fact that I was about to prepare myself to be a dealer in merchandise, preliminary to a permanent establishment, appeared such an enchanting prospect that I felt no disposition to peer into sober realities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>Could we have foreseen, however, that this parting, so calmly proposed and so trustfully accepted, was to be for ever, both of us would have shrunk from the thought of it; but, unknown to ourselves, we had arrived at the parting of the ways, and though we both sincerely hoped the ways would meet, we were gliding along steep planes which would presently precipitate us into the wide gulf of separation.

<p>From the moment it was agreed to part for a while, my father lost no opportunity to fill me with practical counsel, which, had my memory been a knapsack, I could have extracted at will for consolation and guidance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>Unfortunately, for some things my memory was like a sieve: it retained the larger rules, but dropped the lesser ones; it preserved certain principles that had an affinity with my nature, but the multitude of minor ones that he had attempted to graft on my nature fell away, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>I was to be industrious, orderly, honourable, and steady, patient, and obliging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>But something of these I would naturally have shown under any circumstances; but contact with real life discovers that these virtues are insufficient to keep us serene and immaculate, that the spirit of youth requires its sensibilities to be disciplined in many ways before it endures with sweetness and patience the spurns, and gibes, and mocks, of a rude world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>It frequently meets conditions wherein nothing will avail but force, of a most strenuous kind.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>At that moment, there was a wild fluttering of the heart; and something like an ugly cloud of presentiments, vague shadows of unknown evils to come, which started strong doubts of the wisdom of parting, came over me all at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>But, as usual, when clear expression was most needed, I was too tongue-tied for much speech, so many ideas thronged for utterance, and I turned away as though stricken dumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>Half an hour later, the steamer was only discernible by its trail of smoke.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>After he had gone, the flood-gates were opened, the feelings relieved themselves by torrents of words, and my loss and loneliness pressed hard upon the senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>Much as I had valued him, it needed this time of anguish to reveal fully what he had been to me. Then, pang after pang of poignant contrition pierced me through and through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>I was dissatisfied with the sum of my conduct, with his own professions that I had been to him what he had hoped and wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>If he had but returned there and then, with the clear light that fell on my deficiencies now, how I should have striven to satisfy my own exact ideas of what was due to him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>This little absence, with <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>its unutterable remorse, had been more efficacious in showing me my own inwardness than all his unselfish generosity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>Nearly <num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> have passed since, and I have not experienced such wretchedness as I did that night following his departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>A very little more, and I think it would have exceeded the heart's power to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>My emotions were much more distressing than anyone could have judged from my appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>I caught a view of myself in a mirror, and my face struck me as exhibiting an astonishing contrast to the huge disorder beneath it. For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, I understood the sharpness of the pang which pierces the soul when a loved <num value="1">one</num> lies with folded hands, icy cold, in the sleep of Death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>I vexed myself with asking, Had my conduct been as perfect as I then wished it had been?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>Had I failed in aught?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>Had I esteemed him as he deserved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>Then a craving wish to hear him speak but <num value="1">one</num> word of consolation, to utter <num value="1">one</num> word of blessing, made me address him as though he might hear; but no answer came, and I experienced a shiver of sadness and wished that I could die.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>I have often looked back upon the boy who sat like a stone in his father's chair for hours, revolving with fixed eyes and unmoved face all that this parting seemed to him to mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>Up to a certain point he traced minutely all its details, went over every word and little act, and then a great blank wall met him, into which he strove and strove again to penetrate, and, being baffled, resumed his mental rehearsals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>Before <persName n="Ingham,Major,,,," id="n0103.0010.00145.00450" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName> turned his steps homeward, I received a letter from my father duly announcing his arrival at the island of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>After describing the passage across the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, he went on to say that the more he thought of his plans, the more he was inclined to regard the <rs>Major</rs>'s invitation as a happy incident in his programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>He had often pondered over the best means of starting me in a business for which I had a decided bent, and he had been sounding several country merchants with a view of giving me a preliminary training, but he had constantly deferred a decision in the hope of finding something that more nearly suited his ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>Now, however, it all seemed clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>He had always fancied the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas River</placeName>, as it had a richer back country than any other, and, by means of the steamers and its superior navigation, was <pb id="p.146" n="146"/>in direct communication with the cities on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>There were many professions and trades for which I was fit, but he thought that I was more partial to a mercantile career, and he was glad of it. He went on to say that I had made a wonderful advance during the last year with him, but it was on the next few years that my future depended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>For tiding over them successfully, I had only to hold fast to my principles, and be fearless in all manly things; to persevere and win.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>The letter seemed to be his very self, full of practical sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>I felt enriched by its possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>It was a novelty to have a letter of my own, sent from such a distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>I read it over and over, and found new meanings and greater solace each time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>The signature attracted my attention with its peculiar whip, or flourish, below; and in my reply, which covered many pages, I annexed that whip and ended my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> epistle with it; and, ever since, no signature of mine has been complete without it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>Soon after, <persName n="Ingham,Major,,,," id="n0103.0010.00146.00451" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName> started on his return home in a stern-wheeler bound for the <placeName reg="Ouachita River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021027">Washita</placeName> and <placeName reg="Whittington, Hot Spring, Arkansas" key="tgn,2769106">Saline Rivers</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>On, or about, the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> day from New Orleans, the steamer entered the <rs>Saline</rs>, and a few miles above <placeName key="tgn,2469366" n="1.000 2" reg="longview, bradley, arkansas">Long View</placeName> we landed on the right bank, and, mounting into a well-worn buggy, were driven a few miles inland to <persName n="Ingham,,,,," id="n0103.0010.00146.00452" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><surname>Ingham</surname></persName>'s plantation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>I am as unaware of the real status of my host among his neighbours, as I am of the size of his domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>It then appeared in my eyes immense, but was mostly a pine forest, in the midst of which some few score of black men had cleared a large space for planting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>The house was of solid pine logs, roughly squared, and but slightly stained by weather, and neatly chinked without with plaster, and lined within with planed boards, new and unpainted &mdash; it had an air of domestic comfort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>My welcome from <persName n="Ingham,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0010.00146.00453" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName> left nothing to be desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>The slaves of the house thronged in her train, and curtsied <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>and bobbed, with every token of genuine gladness, to the <quote><rs type="role2">Massa</rs>,</quote> as they called him, and then were good enough to include me in their bountiful joy. The supper which had been got ready was something of a banquet, for it was to celebrate the return of the planter, and was calculated to prove to him that, though New Orleans hotels might furnish more variety, home, after all, had its attractions in pure, clean, well-cooked viands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>When the hearth-logs began to crackle, and the fire-light danced joyfully on the family circle, I began to feel the influence of the charm, and was ready to view my stay in the western woods with interest and content.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>But there was <num value="1">one</num> person in the family that caused a doubt in my mind, and that was the overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>He joined us after supper, and, almost immediately, I contracted a dislike for him. His vulgarity and coarseness revived recollections of levee men. His garb was offensive; the pantaloons stuffed into his boots, the big hat, the slouch of his carriage, his rough boisterousness, were all objectionable, and more than all his accents and the manner of his half-patronising familiarity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>I set him down at once as <num value="1">one</num> of those men who haunt liquor-saloons, and are proud to claim acquaintance with bar-tenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>Something in me, perhaps my offishness, may probably have struck him with equal repulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>Under pretence of weariness I sought my bed, for the circle had lost its charm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>The next day the diet was not so sumptuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>The breakfast at <num value="7">seven</num>, the dinner at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, and the supper at <num value="6">six</num>, consisted of pretty much the same kind of dishes, except that there was good coffee at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meal, and plenty of good milk for the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>The rest mainly consisted of boiled, or fried, pork and beans, and corn scones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>The pork had an excess of fat over the lean, and was followed by a plate full of mush and molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>I was never very particular as to my diet, but as day after day followed, the want of variety caused it to pall on the palate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>Provided other things had not tended to make me critical, I might have gratefully endured it, but what affected me principally were the encomiums lavished upon this style of cookery by the overseer, who, whether with the view of currying favour with <persName n="Ingham,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0010.00147.00454" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName>, or to exasperate my suppressed squeamishness, would bawl out, <quote>I guess you can't beat this, howsumdever you crack up New Or-lee-ans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>Give <pb id="p.148" n="148"/>me a raal western pot-luck, to your darned fixin's in them &lsquo;ar <placeName reg="Mississippi, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> towns.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>With such society and fare, I could not help feeling depressed, but the tall pine forest, with its mysterious lights and shades, had its compensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>As, in process of time, the planter intended to extend his clearing and raise more cotton, every tree felled assisted in widening the cultivable land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>On learning this, I asked and obtained permission to cut down as many trees as I liked, and, like a ruthless youth with latent destructive propensities, I found an extraordinary pleasure in laying low with a keen axe the broad pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>I welcomed with a savage delight the apparent agony, the portentous shiver which ran from root to topmost plume, the thunderous fall, and the wild recoil of its neighbours, as it rebounded and quivered before it lay its still length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>After about a score of the pine monarchs had been levelled, the negroes at work presented new features of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>On the outskirts of the clearing they were chopping up timber into portable or rollable logs, some were <quote>toting</quote> logs to the blazing piles, others rolled them hand over hand to the fires, and each gang chanted heartily as it toiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>As they appeared to enjoy it, I became infected with their spirit and assisted at the logrolling, or lent a hand at the toting, and championed my side against the opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>I waxed so enthusiastic over this manly work, which demanded the exertion of every ounce of muscle, that it is a marvel I did not suffer from the strain; its fierce joy was more to my taste than felling timber by myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>The atmosphere, laden with the scent of burning resin, the roaring fires, the dance of the lively flames, the excitement of the gangs while holding on, with grim resolve and in honour bound, to the bearing-spikes, had a real fascination for me. For a week, I rose with the darkies at the sound of the overseer's horn, greeted the revivifying sunrise with anticipating spirits, sat down to breakfast with a glow which made the <rs>Major</rs> and his wife cheerier, and then strode off to join in the war against the pines with a springy pace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>How long this toil would have retained its sportive aspect for me I know not, but I owed it to the overseer that I ceased to love it. He was a compound of a Legree<note anchored="yes">

It was his duty to oversee all the gangs, the hoers, wood-cutters, fire-attendants, log-rollers, and toters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>When he approached the gang with which I worked, the men became subdued, and stopped their innocent chaff and play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>He had <num value="2">two</num> favourite songs: <num value="1">one</num> was about his <quote>deah Lucindah,</quote> and the other about the <quote>chill winds of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>,</quote> which he hummed in a nasal tone when within speaking distance of me, while the cracks of his <quote>black snake</quote> whip kept time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>But, as he sauntered away to other parts, I felt he was often restive at my presence, for it imposed a certain restraint on his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/><num value="1">One</num> day, however, he was in a worse humour than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>His face was longer, and malice gleamed in his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>When he reached us we missed the usual tunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>He cried out his commands with a more imperious note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>A young fellow named <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victim of his ire, and, as he was carrying a heavy log with myself and others, he could not answer him so politely as he expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>He flicked at his naked shoulders with his whip, and the lash, flying unexpectedly near me, caused us both to drop our spikes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>Unassisted by us, the weight of the log was too great for the others, and it fell to the ground crushing the foot of <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>Meantime, furious at the indignity, I had engaged him in a wordy contest: hot words, even threats, were exchanged, and had it not been for the cries of the wounded man who was held fast by the log, we should probably have fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>The end of it was, I retired from the field, burning with indignation, and disgusted with his abominable brutality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>I sought <persName n="Ingham,Major,,,," id="n0103.0010.00149.00458" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName>, whom I found reclining his length in an easy-chair on the verandah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>Not hearing the righteous condemnation I had hoped he would express, and surprised at his want of feeling, I hotly protested against the cruelty of the overseer in attacking a man while all his strength was needed to preserve others from peril, and declaimed against him for using a whip in proximity to my ears, which made the <rs>Major</rs> smile compassionately at my inexperience in such matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>This was too much for my patience, and I then and there announced my intention to seek the hospitality of <persName n="Waring,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0010.00149.00459" reg="mostcommon:Waring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Waring</surname></persName>, his neighbour, as I could not be any longer the guest of a man who received my complaint so unsympathetically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>On hearing me say this, <persName n="Ingham,Mrs.,,,," id="n0103.0010.00149.00460" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName> came out of the house, <pb id="p.150" n="150"/>and expressed so much concern at this sudden rupture of our relations that I regretted having been so hasty, and the <rs>Major</rs> tried to explain how planters were compelled to leave field-work in charge of their overseer; but it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>Words had been uttered which left a blister in the mind, personal dignity had been grossly wounded, the <rs>Major</rs> had not the art of salving sores of this kind, and I doggedly clung to my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>In another quarter of an hour I had left the plantation with a small bundle of letters and papers, and was trudging through the woods to <persName n="Waring,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0010.00150.00461" reg="mostcommon:Waring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Waring</surname></persName>'s plantation.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>Strange to say, in proportion to the period spent at <persName n="Ingham,Major,,,," id="n0103.0010.00150.00463" reg="mostcommon:Ingham,Charles,Edward,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Ingham</surname></persName>'s, I possess a more vivid recollection of the night I passed at <persName n="Waring,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0010.00150.00464" reg="mostcommon:Waring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Waring</surname></persName>'s, and my thoughts have more often reverted to the more ancient house and its snugness and pleasant details, than to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>As I did not mention anything about the causes of my departure from his neighbour's plantation, it was tacitly understood that I was only resting for the night, previous to resuming my journey next morning, and they did not press me to stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>I begged, however, <persName n="Waring,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0010.00150.00465" reg="mostcommon:Waring,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Waring</surname></persName> to do me the favour to send a buggy for my trunk the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>When it arrived, I repacked it; and, leaving it in his charge, I set off on a tramp across country to the <rs>Arkansas</rs>, rejecting many an offer of aid up to the last minute.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>The road wound up and down pine-clothed hills, and, being a sandy loam, was dry and tolerably smooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>In the hollows I generally found a stream where I quenched my thirst, but I remember to have travelled a considerable distance for a young pedestrian without meeting any water, and to have reflected a little upon what the pains of dying from thirst would be like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2165"/>I rested at a small farm-house that night; and, next morning, at an early hour, was once more footing it bravely, more elated, perhaps, than my condition justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2166"/>I regarded myself as being upon a fine adventure, the narration <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>of which would surprise my father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2167"/>My eyes travelled through far-reaching colonnades of tapering pine and flourishing oak, and for a great part of the time I lost consciousness of my circumstances, while my mind was absorbed in interminable imaginings of impossible discoveries and incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>I saw myself the hero of many a thrilling surprise, and looked dreamily through the shades, as though in some places like them I would meet the preying beasts whom it would be my fortune to strike dead with my staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>But, invariably, on being brought to a proper sense of the scenes, and my real condition, I recognized how helpless I was against a snarling catamount, or couchant panther; I was devoutly thankful that <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> was so civilised that my courage was in no fear of being tested.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>We had hip-pockets made in our trousers, and the <rs>Smith</rs> and <rs>Wesson</rs> was regarded as an indispensable adjunct to manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Our leisure hours were devoted to target-practice, until my proficiency was so great that I could sever a pack-thread at <num value="20">twenty</num> paces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>Theoretically, we were already man-slaughterers, for our only object in practice was to be expert in killing some imaginary rowdy, or burglar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>In our rude world such a person might present himself at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>The rowdy needed only a little liquor to develop himself, and the store, guarded only by a boy at night, offered a tempting inducement to a burglarious individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>Among our <num value="100">hundred</num> and odd customers there were several who were not over-regardful of our susceptibilities; and as my colleagues were of their own kidney, and had an acute sense of their dignity, there was no saying when a crisis might arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>Personally, I was not yet wrought up to this fine susceptiveness, though, probably, I had as quick a spirit as any fire-eater in <placeName reg="Arkansas, Arkansas, United States" key="tgn,2000105">Arkansas County</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>What I might do if my patience was abused, or how much bullying would be required to urge me to adopt the style in vogue, was, however, as yet undetermined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>Of the code of honour and <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>usage I had heard enough, but whenever I supposed myself to be the object of rude aggression, the dire extreme made me shrink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>The contingency was a daily topic, but, when I dwelt on the possibility of being involved, I inwardly held that liquory ebullience ought not to be noticed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>Among our customers was a man named <persName n="Coleman,,,,," id="n0103.0010.00159.00497" reg="mostcommon:Coleman,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleman</surname></persName>, a large, loose-jointed young fellow, who owned a plantation and some <num value="20">twenty</num> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>At regular intervals he came to make his purchase of cloth for his slaves, provisions, etc., and always departed with a bottle of whiskey in each saddle-bag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>At the commencement it was taken to be the rough pleasantry of a drunken rustic; but, as <persName n="Coleman,,,,," id="n0103.0010.00159.00498" reg="mostcommon:Coleman,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleman</surname></persName> reiterated the charge, the clerk's patience was exhausted, and he retorted that swamp-water was whole &mdash; some for drunkards such as he.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>Almost immediately after, the clerk had flung himself against his opponent, and we all <num value="3">three</num> came to the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>Some weeks after this event, I was despatched round the neighbourhood to collect debts, and his name was on my list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>There was an ominous silence about his house as I rode up, but, on making my way to the negro quarter to make enquiries, I was told in a frightened whisper that their master had disappeared into parts unknown, after killing Francis Rush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/><pb id="p.160" n="160"/></p> 
<p>An evening came when the long-expected burglarious adventure occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>Near the main entrance to the store was a candle, which I proceeded to light after entering the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>Then, closing and dropping the strong bar across the door, I walked down the length of the store towards the office and my bedroom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>Holding the candle well up, I noticed as I passed the fire-place a pile of soot on the hearth-stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>As it had been swept clean after the day's business, the sight of it instantly suggested a burglar being in the chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>Without halting, I passed on to the office, cast a quick look at the back door and windows, and, snatching my little revolver from under the pillow, retraced my steps to the fire-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>Pointing the weapon up the chimney, I cried out, <quote>Look out, I am about to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>After the word <quote><num value="3">three</num></quote> I shall shoot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/><num value="1">One</num>! <num value="2">two</num>!--</quote> A cloud of soot poured down on my arm, the rumble of a hasty scramble was heard, and I fired into the brick to hasten his departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>I then flew into the office, set my candle upon a chair, opened the back door, and darted out in time to see a negro's head and shoulders above the chimney-top.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>By means of threats, and a sufficient demonstration with the fire-arm, he was made to descend, and marched to <placeName><persName n="Altschul,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0010.00160.00504" reg="mostcommon:Altschul,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Altschul</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, where he surrendered to the proprietor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>Except that he was severely bound, his treatment was respectful, for he represented over a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure>, and to injure him was to injure <persName n="Goree,Doctor,,,," id="n0103.0010.00160.00505" reg="nearbymention:Goree,Dan,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Goree</surname></persName>, his owner, and <num value="1">one</num> of our most respected customers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>In the afternoon, he was attending a clamouring crowd of about <num value="30">thirty</num> negroes, with his counter littered with goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>As I came in, I observed that he was not so alertly watchful as he ought to have been, with such a number of men, and so many exposed articles, I sat down and closely watched, and saw that, each time his back was turned, <num value="2">two</num> men abstracted stockings, thread-spools, <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>and ribands, stuffing them into their capacious pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>After considering the best method of compelling restoration, I withdrew and called <persName n="Simon,,,,," id="n0103.0010.00161.00508" reg="mostcommon:Simon,nomatch:0"><surname>Simon</surname></persName>, <persName n="Altschul,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0010.00161.00509" reg="mostcommon:Altschul,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Altschul</surname></persName>'s burly slave, and instructed him how to assist me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>A few seconds after re-entering the store, the <num value="2">two</num> halves of the front door were suddenly flung to, and barred, and a cry of <q direct="unspecified">Thieves</q> was raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>There was a violent movement towards me, but <persName n="Simon,,,,," id="n0103.0010.00161.00510" reg="mostcommon:Simon,nomatch:0"><surname>Simon</surname></persName> flourished a big knife above his head, and swore he would use it, if they did not stand still and be searched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>Those who were conscious of their innocence sided with us.; and through their help we turned out a pretty assortment of small goods, which the clerk, by referring to his sales-book, found had not been sold.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>I went out to shoot turtle-doves <num value="1">one</num> holiday, and aimed at <num value="1">one</num> on a branch about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> above the road, and over-hanging it.

Seeing no <num value="1">one</num> else near, and assuming that he was under some great mistake, I asked what the matter was, upon which he boldly accused me of shooting at him, and he put his hand to his face to show the wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>As there was not the slightest trace of even a bruise, I laughed at him, as it seemed to me that only an overdose of whiskey could account for such a paroxysm of passion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>Since my arrival at <placeName reg="Auburn, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2110491">Auburn</placeName> I had received <num value="3">three</num> letters from my father from <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName>, within a period of about <measure n="9weeks" type="date">nine weeks</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>The last letter had stated that his brother was convalescent, and that, in about a month, he intended to return to New Orleans, and would then pay me a visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>In the mean time, wholly unheeded by me, astounding national events had occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>Forts, arsenals, and ships of war had been seized by the revolted States, and, what was of more importance to me, the forts below New Orleans had been taken by the <rs>Louisiana</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/><pb id="p.162" n="162"/>These events were known to readers of newspapers in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, but the only newspaper taken at the <rs type="place">Auburn store</rs> was a <placeName reg="Pine Bluff, Jefferson, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009230">Pine Bluff</placeName> weekly, which, as I seldom saw it, I never imagined would contain any news of personal interest to me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>It was not until <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> that I began dimly to comprehend that something was transpiring which would involve every individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>Their determine accents and resolute gestures roused my curiosity, and I heard them say that the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> others, had already formed a separate government, and <num value="1">one</num> called <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName> had been proclaimed <rs type="role2">President</rs> of a new government; and they wondered why <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> was slow to join the <rs>Confederates</rs>, etc., etc. This was news to me and when they unfolded their respective newspapers and read extracts from them, it dawned upon me that if I wished to post myself upon the grave national affairs, I should have to read those stupid sheets which hitherto I had regarded as being only fit for merchants and bearded men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>Thus stimulated to think that the events of the time affected the people of <placeName reg="Arkansas, Arkansas, United States" key="tgn,2000105">Arkansas County</placeName>, even youths like myself, I began to read the <rs type="place">Pine Bluff</rs> paper, and to be more inquisitive; and it was not long before I had a vague conception that the country was in a terribly disturbed state, and that there would be war. Notwithstanding the information gleaned from persons who gave themselves little trouble to satisfy a strange boy, it was not until young <persName n="Goree,,Dan,,," id="n0103.0010.00162.00514" reg="default:Goree,Dan,,,"><foreName>Dan</foreName> <surname>Goree</surname></persName> returned from <placeName reg="Nashville College">Nashville College</placeName> that I could assimilate properly all that I had heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>Of course, said he, in that event all slave-holders <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>would be ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>That was the reason that all the people of the <rs>South</rs> were rising against the <rs>Northern</rs> people, and they would fight, to the last man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>I need not pursue the theme, but it was from such a source that I obtained my elementary lessons in American Politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>From the time when, in <dateStruct value="1857-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, I had read some leaderette about the <rs>Louisiana Legislative Assembly</rs>, politics had been repulsively dry to me, and newspapers were only useful for their shipping and trade details.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>Specially interesting to me, however, was it to know that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and its metropolis, <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, would assuredly join the <rs>South</rs>; though I was saddened to learn that <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> and <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> were enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>The conditions of trade would be altogether altered!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>It was not, however, until I had propounded the question as to how the seizure of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> forts affected people who were abroad, and wished to return home, that I understood how deeply involved I was by this rupture of relations between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>I was told that all communication was stopped, that ships coming in from sea would be turned back, or else, if they were permitted to come in by the cruisers outside, would certainly not be permitted to leave; that every ship insisting on going to New Orleans would be searched, and, if anything likely to assist the enemy was <pb id="p.164" n="164"/>found, she would be detained, and perhaps confiscated; and that, as no vessel was permitted to enter the river, so none would have the privilege of leaving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>It was an evil hour to meditate any design of a personal nature, for the sentiment of the period was averse from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>Man after man unresistingly succumbed to its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>So far, I had made none of any importance; but enlisting in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, because I received a packet of female clothes, was certainly a grave blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>but after a while, as the heat began to force a copious perspiration, and the limy dust from the metalled highway parched our throats, they sobered down, and allowed us to march at ease.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2459"/>Within an hour the sweat had darkly stained our grey coats about the arm-pits and shoulders, and it rolled in streams down our limbs into our boots, where, mingling with the dust and minute gravel, it formed a gritty mud which distressed our feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2460"/>Our shoulders ached with the growing weight and hardness of the muskets, our trousers galled us sorely, the straps and belts became painfully constrictive, and impeded respiration, but, through fear of shame, we endured all, without complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2461"/>At the end of the hour we were halted for <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> rest, and then resumed the march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>Like all new recruits, we carried a number of things that veterans dispense with: for instance, keepsakes, and personal treasures; mine were a daguerreotype of my adopted father, and a lock of his grey hair,--very trivial and valueless to others, but my own peculiar treasures, carried in my knapsack to be looked at every <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> when we smartened <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>For growing and lean youths this was a tremendous weight; and, during the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> hour, the sense of oppression and soreness rapidly increased; but, excepting more frequent changes of the musket from shoulder to shoulder, we bated nothing of our resolve to endure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>After the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> halt we were sensibly lamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>The gravel created blisters, and the warm mud acted like a poultice on the feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>The military erectness gave way to a weary droop, and we leaned forward more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>We were painfully scalded, restlessly shifted our weapons, and tried scores of little experiments, hustled our cartridge-pouches, inch by inch, then from back to front, from right to left; tugged at our breast-straps, eased our belts, drank copious draughts of water; and still the perspiration rolled in a shower down our half-blinded faces, and the symptoms of collapse became more and more pronounced.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>Finally, the acutest point of endurance was reached, and nature revolted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>Our feet were blistered, our agonies were unendurable, and, despite official warning and menace, we hopped to the road-side, whipped off our boots to relieve our burning feet; after a little rest, we rose and limped after the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>But the column had stretched out to a tremendous length with its long wagon-train, and to overtake our friends seemed hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>As we limped along, the still untired soldiers mocked and jeered at us, and this was very hard to endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>The next day was a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>Many of us were more fitted for hospital at day-break than for marching, but, after a bathe in the stream, a change of linen, and salving our wounds, we were in better mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>We have seen what a process the physical training is, by the brief description of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>It takes some time to bring the body to a suitable <pb id="p.176" n="176"/>state for ungrudging acceptance of the hard conditions of campaigning, so that it can find comfort on a pike, or in a graveyard, with a stone for a pillow, and ease on clods, despite drenching rain and chilling dew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>Our ordinary march was now more in the nature of an agreeable relief from monotonous camp-duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>We were not so captious and ready to take offence as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and some things that were once most disagreeable were now regarded as diversions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>I now fully accepted it as a rule that a soldier must submit to military law; but many, like myself, had lost a great deal of that early enthusiasm for a soldier's life by the time we had reached <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>It had struck us when at picket-duty alone, in the dark, that we had been great fools to place ourselves voluntarily in a position whence we could not retreat without forfeit of life; and that, by a monosyllable, we had made our comrades our possible enemies upon a single breach of our oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>We had condemned ourselves to a servitude more slavish than that of the black plantation-hands, about whose condition <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> had declared war to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>To say the truth, I had not even a desire to shirk the duties I had undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>Nevertheless, when far removed from the hubbub of camp, at my isolated post, my reason could not be prevented from taking a cynical view of my folly in devoting myself to be food for powder, when I might have been free as a bird, to the extent of my means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>And if, among my vague fancies, I had thought that, by gallantry, I might win promotion such as would be some compensation for the sacrifice of my liberty, that idea had been exploded as soon as I had measured myself by hundreds of cleverer, abler, and braver men, and saw that they, even, had no chance of anything but to fill a nameless grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>If I had not a fraction of an ear, and an eye inclined towards my <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> and Company, I had been spell-bound by the energies now opposed to us. I likened the cannon, with their deep bass, to the roaring of a great herd of lions; the ripping, cracking musketry, to the incessant yapping of terriers; the windy whisk of shells, and zipping of minie bullets, to the swoop of eagles, and the buzz of angry wasps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>All the opposing armies of <persName n="Grey,,,,," id="n0103.0012.00192.00617" reg="mostcommon:Grey,George,,,:15"><surname>Grey</surname></persName> and Blue fiercely blazed at each other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>After being exposed for a few seconds to this fearful downpour, we heard the order to <quote>Lie down, men, and continue your firing!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>Before me was a prostrate tree, about <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> in diameter, with a narrow strip of light between it and the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>Behind this shelter a dozen of us flung ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>The security it appeared to offer restored me to my individuality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>We could fight, and think, and observe, better than out in the open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>But it was a terrible period!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>How the cannon bellowed, and their shells plunged and bounded, and flew with screeching hisses over us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>Their sharp rending explosions and hurtling fragments made us shrink and cower, despite our utmost efforts to be cool and collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>I marvelled, as I heard the unintermitting patter, snip, thud, and hum of the bullets, how anyone could live under this raining death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>I could hear the balls beating a merciless tattoo on the outer surface of the log, pinging vivaciously as they flew off at a tangent from it, and thudding into something or other, at the rate of a <num value="100">hundred</num> a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>. <num value="1">One</num>, here and there, found its way under the log, and buried itself in a comrade's body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/><num value="1">One</num> man raised his chest, as if to yawn, and jostled me. I turned to him, and saw that a bullet had gored his whole face, and penetrated into his chest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>Another ball struck a man a deadly rap on the head, and he turned on his back and showed his ghastly white face to the sky. <pb id="p.193" n="193"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>He lifted his head a little too high, and a bullet skimmed over the top of the log and hit him fairly in the centre of his forehead, and he fell heavily on his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>But his thought had been instantaneously general; and the officers, with <num value="1">one</num> voice, ordered the charge; and cries of <quote>Forward, forward!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>raised us, as with a spring, to our feet, and changed the complexion of our feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>The pulse of action beat feverishly once more; and, though overhead was crowded with peril, we were unable to give it so much attention as when we lay stretched on the ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>Just as we bent our bodies for the onset, a boy's voice cried out, <quote>Oh, stop, <hi rend="italics">please</hi> stop a bit, I have been hurt, and can't move!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>I turned to look, and saw <persName n="Parker,,Henry,,," id="n0103.0012.00193.00618" reg="default:Parker,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, standing on <num value="1">one</num> leg, and dolefully regarding his smashed foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>In another <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, we were striding impetuously towards the enemy, vigorously plying our muskets, stopping only to prime the pan and ram the load down, when, with a spring or <num value="2">two</num>, we would fetch up with the front, aim, and fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>Our progress was not so continuously rapid as we desired, for the blues were obdurate; but at this moment we were gladdened at the sight of a battery galloping to our assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>It was time for the nerve-shaking cannon to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>After <num value="2">two</num> rounds of shell and canister, we felt the pressure on us slightly relaxed; but we were still somewhat sluggish in disposition, though the officers' voices rang out imperiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>Newton Story at this juncture strode forward rapidly with the <name>Dixies</name>' banner, until he was quite <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> ahead of the foremost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>Finding himself alone, he halted; and turning to us smilingly, said, <quote>Why don't you come on, boys?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/><quote>You see there is no danger!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>His smile and words acted on us like magic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>We raised the yell, and sprang lightly and hopefully towards him. <quote>Let's give them hell, boys!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>said <num value="1">one</num>. <quote>Plug them plum-centre, every time!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>It was all very encouraging, for the yelling and shouting were taken up by <num value="1000">thousands</num>. <quote>Forward, forward; don't give them breathing time!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>was cried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>We instinctively obeyed, and soon came in clear view of the blue-coats, who were scornfully unconcerned at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but, seeing the leaping tide of <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>men coming on at a tremendous pace, their front dissolved, and they fled in double-quick retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>Again we felt the <quote>glorious joy of heroes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>It carried us on exultantly, rejoicing in the spirit which recognises nothing but the prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>We were no longer an army of soldiers, but so many school-boys racing, in which length of legs, wind, and condition tell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>We gained the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of camps, continued the rush through them, and clean beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>It was now about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>. My physical powers were quite exhausted, and, to add to my discomfiture, something struck me on my belt-clasp, and tumbled me headlong to the ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>I could not have been many minutes prostrated before I recovered from the shock of the blow and fall, to find my clasp deeply dented and cracked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>My company was not in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>I was grateful for the rest, and crawled feebly to a tree, and plunging my hand into my haversack, ate ravenously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>Within half an hour, feeling renovated, I struck north in the direction which my regiment had taken, over a ground strewn with bodies and the debris of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>The desperate character of this day's battle was now brought home to my mind in all its awful reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>While in the tumultuous advance, and occupied with a myriad of exciting incidents, it was only at brief intervals that I was conscious of wounds being given and received; but now, in the trail of pursuers and pursued, the ghastly relics appalled every sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>I felt curious as to who the fallen Greys were, and moved to <num value="1">one</num> stretched straight out. It was the body of a stout <persName n="Sergeant,,English,,," id="n0103.0012.00194.00619" reg="default:Sergeant,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Sergeant</surname></persName> of a neighbouring company, the members of which hailed principally from the <rs type="place">Washita Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>At the crossing of the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas River</placeName> this plump, ruddy-faced man had been conspicuous for his complexion, jovial features, and good-humour, and had been nicknamed <quote><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> bull.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>He was now lifeless, and lay with his eyes wide open, regardless of the scorching sun, and the tempestuous cannonade which sounded through the forest, and the musketry that crackled incessantly along the front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>Close by him was a young <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, who, judging by the new gloss on his uniform, must have been some father's darling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>A clean bullet-hole through the centre of his forehead had instantly ended his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>A little further were <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>some <num value="20">twenty</num> bodies, lying in various postures, each by its own pool of viscous blood, which emitted a peculiar scent, which was new to me, but which I have since learned is inseparable from a battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>Beyond these, a still larger group lay, body overlying body, knees crooked, arms erect, or wide-stretched and rigid, according as the last spasm overtook them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>The company opposed to them must have shot straight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>Other details of that ghastly trail formed a mass of horrors that will always be remembered at the mention of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>I can never forget the impression those wide-open dead eyes made on me. Each seemed to be starting out of its socket, with a look similar to the fixed wondering gaze of an infant, as though the dying had viewed something appalling at the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/><quote>Can it be,</quote> I asked myself, <quote>that at the last glance they saw their own retreating souls, and wondered why their caskets were left behind, like offal?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>My surprise was that the form we made so much of, and that nothing was too good for, should now be mutilated, hacked, and outraged; and that the life, hitherto guarded as a sacred thing, and protected by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, Law, <rs type="role" reg="Minister">Ministers</rs> of Justice, Police, should, of a sudden,--at least, before I can realise it,--be given up to death!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>An object once seen, if it has affected my imagination, remains indelibly fixed in my memory; and, among many other scenes with which it is now crowded, I cannot forget that half-mile square of woodland, lighted brightly by the sun, and littered by the forms of about a <measure n="1000" type="dead">thousand dead</measure> and wounded men, and by horses, and <rs n="military equipments" type="product">military equipments</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>It formed a picture that may always be reproduced with an almost absolute fidelity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>For it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Field of Glory I had seen in my <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> of life, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that Glory sickened me with its repulsive aspect, and made me suspect it was all a glittering lie. In my imagination, I saw more than it was my fate to see with my eyes, for, under a flag of truce, I saw the bearers pick up the dead from the field, and lay them in long rows beside a wide trench; I saw them laid, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, close together at the bottom,--thankless victims of a perished cause, and all their individual hopes, pride, honour, names, buried under oblivious earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/><pb id="p.196" n="196"/></p> 
<p>My thoughts reverted to the time when these festering bodies were idolized objects of their mothers' passionate love, their fathers standing by, half-fearing to touch the fragile little things, and the wings of civil law out-spread to protect parents and children in their family loves, their coming and going followed with pride and praise, and the blessing of the <name>Almighty</name> over-shadowing all. Then, as they were nearing manhood, through some strange warp of Society, men in authority summoned them from school and shop, field and farm, to meet in the woods on a <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> for mutual butchery with the deadliest instruments ever invented, Civil Law, Religion, and Morality complaisantly standing aside, while <num value="90000">90,000</num> young men, who had been preached and moralized to, for years, were let loose to engage in the carnival of slaughter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>Only yesterday, they professed to shudder at the word <quote>Murder.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>To-day, by a strange twist in human nature, they lusted to kill, and were hounded on in the work of destruction by their pastors, elders, mothers, and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>Oh, for once, I was beginning to know the real truth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>Man was born for slaughter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>All the pains taken to soothe his savage heart were unavailing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>Holy words and heavenly hopes had no lasting effect on his bestial nature, for, when once provoked, how swiftly he flung aside the sweet hope of Heaven, and the dread of Hell, with which he amused himself in time of ease!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>As I moved, horror-stricken, through the fearful shambles, where the dead lay as thick as the sleepers in a London park on a Bank Holiday, I was unable to resist the belief that my education had been in abstract things, which had no relation to our animal existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>For, if human life is so disparaged, what has it to do with such high subjects as <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, Heaven, and Immortality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>And to think how devotional men and women pretended to be, on a Sunday!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>Oh, cunning, cruel man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>He knew that the sum of all real knowledge and effort was to know how to kill and mangle his brothers, as we were doing to-day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>Reflecting on my own emotions, I wondered if other youths would feel that they had been deluded like myself with man's fine polemics and names of things, which vanished with the reality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>A multitude of angry thoughts surged through me, which <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>I cannot describe in detail, but they amounted to this, that a cruel deception had been practised on my blank ignorance, that my atom of imagination and feeling had been darkened, and that man was a portentous creature from which I recoiled with terror and pity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>He was certainly terrible and hard, but he was no more to me now than a <num value="2">two</num>-legged beast; he was cunning beyond finding out, but his morality was only a mask for his wolfish heart!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>Thus, scoffing and railing at my infatuation for moral excellence as practised by humanity, I sought to join my company and regiment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>The battle-field maintained the same character of undulated woodland, being, in general, low ridges separated by broad depressions, which sunk occasionally into ravines of respectable depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>At various places, wide clearings had been made; and I came across a damp bottom or <num value="2">two</num> covered with shrubs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>For a defensive force there were several positions that were admirable as rallying-points, and it is perhaps owing to these, and the undoubted courage exhibited by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, that the battle was so protracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>Though our attack had been a surprise, it was certain that they fought as though they were resolved to deny it; and, as the ground to be won from the enemy was nearly <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> in depth, and every half mile or so they stood and obstinately contested it, all the honours of the day were not to be with us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>I overtook my regiment about <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>, and found that it was engaged in <num value="1">one</num> of these occasional spurts of fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>The enemy resolutely maintained their ground, and our side was preparing for another assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>The firing was alternately brisk and slack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>We lay down, and availed ourselves of trees, logs, and hollows, and annoyed their upstanding ranks; battery pounded battery, and, meanwhile, we hugged our resting-places closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Of a sudden, we rose and raced towards the position, and took it by sheer weight and impetuosity, as we had done before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>About <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, the battle grew very hot. The enemy appeared to be more concentrated, and immovably sullen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>Both sides fired better as they grew more accustomed to the din; but, with assistance from the reserves, we were continually pressing them towards the river <rs>Tennessee</rs>, without ever retreating an inch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>About this time, the enemy were assisted by the gun-boats, <pb id="p.198" n="198"/>which hurled their enormous projectiles far beyond us; but, though they made great havoc among the trees, and created terror, they did comparatively little damage to those in close touch with the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>The screaming of the big shells, when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> began to sail over our heads, had the effect of reducing our fire; for they were as fascinating as they were distracting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>But we became used to them, and our attention was being claimed more in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>Our officers were more urgent; and, when we saw the growing dyke of white cloud that signalled the bullet-storm, we could not be indifferent to the more immediate danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>Dead bodies, wounded men writhing in agony, and assuming every distressful attitude, were frequent sights; but what made us heart-sick was to see, now and then, the well-groomed charger of an officer, with fine saddle, and scarlet and yellow-edged cloth, and brass-tipped holsters, or a stray cavalry or artillery horse, galloping between the lines, snorting with terror, while his entrails, soiled with dust, trailed behind him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>Our officers had continued to show the same alertness and vigour throughout the day; but, as it drew near <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, though they strove to encourage and urge us on, they began to abate somewhat in their energy; and it was evident that the pluckiest of the men lacked the spontaneity and springing ardour which had distinguished them earlier in the day. Several of our company lagged wearily behind, and the remainder showed, by their drawn faces, the effects of their efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>Yet, after a short rest, they were able to make splendid spurts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>As for myself, I had only <num value="1">one</num> wish, and that was for repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>The long-continued excitement, the successive tautening and relaxing of the nerves, the quenchless thirst, made more intense by the fumes of sulphurous powder, and the caking grime on the lips, caused by tearing the paper cartridges, and a ravening hunger, all combined, had reduced me to a walking automaton, and I earnestly wished that night would come, and stop all further effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>Finally, about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>, we assaulted and captured a large camp; after driving the enemy well away from it, the front line was as thin as that of a skirmishing body, and we were ordered to retire to the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>There we hungrily sought after provisions, and I was lucky in finding a supply of biscuits <pb id="p.199" n="199"/>and a canteen of excellent molasses, which gave great comfort to myself and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>The plunder in the camp was abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>There were bedding, clothing, and accoutrements without stint; but people were so exhausted they could do no more than idly turn the things over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Night soon fell, and only a few stray shots could now be heard, to remind us of the thrilling and horrid din of the day, excepting the huge bombs from the gun-boats, which, as we were not far from the blue-coats, discomforted only those in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>By <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, I was repeating my experiences in the region of dreams, indifferent to columbiads and mortars, and the torrential rain which, at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, increased the miseries of the wounded and tentless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>An hour before dawn, I awoke from a refreshing sleep; and, after a hearty replenishment of my vitals with biscuit and molasses, I conceived myself to be fresher than on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. While awaiting day-break, I gathered from other early risers their ideas in regard to the events of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>They were under the impression that we had gained a great victory, though we had not, as we had anticipated, reached the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee River</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>At daylight, I fell in with my Company, but there were only about <num value="50">fifty</num> of the <name>Dixies</name> present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>Almost immediately after, symptoms of the coming battle were manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Regiments were hurried into line, but, even to my inexperienced eyes, the troops were in ill-condition for repeating the efforts of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>However, in brief time, in consequence of our pickets being driven in on us, we were moved forward in skirmishing order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>With my musket on the trail I found myself in active motion, more active than otherwise I would have been, perhaps, because <persName n="Smith,Captain,,,," id="n0103.0012.00199.00625" reg="nearbymention:Smith,L.,G.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> had said, <quote>Now, <persName n="Stanley,Mister,,,," id="n0103.0012.00199.00626" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Henry,Morton,,:27"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, if you please, step briskly forward!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>This singling-out of me wounded my <hi rend="italics">amour-propre</hi>, and sent me forward like a rocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>In a short time, we met our opponents in the same formation as <pb id="p.200" n="200"/>ourselves, and advancing most resolutely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>We threw ourselves behind such trees as were near us, fired, loaded, and darted forward to another shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>Presently, I found myself in an open, grassy space, with no convenient tree or stump near; but, seeing a shallow hollow some <num value="20">twenty</num> paces ahead, I made a dash for it, and plied my musket with haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>I became so absorbed with some blue figures in front of me, that I did not pay sufficient heed to my companion greys; the open space was too dangerous, perhaps, for their advance; for, had they emerged, I should have known they were pressing forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>Seeing my blues in about the same proportion, I assumed that the greys were keeping their position, and never once thought of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>However, as, despite our firing, the blues were coming uncomfortably near, I rose from my hollow; but, to my speechless amazement, I found myself a solitary grey, in a line of blue skirmishers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>My companions had retreated!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>The next I heard was, <quote>Down with that gun, Secesh, or I'll drill a hole through you!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>Drop it, quick!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>Half a dozen of the enemy were covering me at the same instant, and I dropped my weapon, incontinently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>Before my consciousness had returned to me, I was being propelled vigorously from behind, and I was in view of a long, swaying line of soldiers, who were marching to meet us with all the precision of drill, and with such a close front that a rabbit would have found it difficult to break through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>But, as time passed, we found it to be a dreary task to endure the unchanging variety of misery surrounding us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>In our treatment, I think there was a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>If so, it may have been from a belief that we should the sooner recover our senses by experiencing as much misery, pain, privation, and sorrow as could be contained within a prison; and, therefore, the authorities rigidly excluded every medical, pious, musical, or literary charity that might have alleviated our sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>It was a barbarous age, it is true; but there were sufficient <name>Christian</name> families in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, who, I am convinced, only needed a suggestion, to have formed societies for the relief of the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>And what an opportunity there was for such, to strengthen piety, to promote cheerfulness, soothe political ferocity, and subdue the brutal and vicious passions which possessed those <num value="1000">thousands</num> of unhappy youths immured within the horrible pen!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>Left to ourselves, with absolutely nothing to do but to brood over our positions, bewail our lots, catch the taint of disease from each other, and passively abide in our prison-pen, we were soon in a fair state of rotting, while yet alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>The reaction from the excitement of the battle-field, and the cheerful presence of exulting <num value="1000">thousands</num>, was suspended for a few days by travel up the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, the generosity of ladysympathisers in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and the trip across <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>; but, after a few days, it set in strong upon us, when once within the bleak camp at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>Everything we saw and touched added its pernicious influence &mdash; the melancholy faces of those who were already wearied with their confinement, the numbers of the sick, the premature agedness of the emaciated, the distressing degeneration of manhood, the plaints of suffering wretches, the increasing bodily discomfort from ever-multiplying vermin, which infested every square inch.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>Within a week, our new draft commenced to succumb under the maleficent influences of our surroundings.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>The latrines were all at the rear of our plank barracks, and each time imperious nature compelled us to resort to them, we lost a little of that respect and consideration we owed our fellow-creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>For, on the way thither, we saw crowds of sick men, who had fallen, prostrate from weakness, and given themselves wholly to despair; and, while they crawled or wallowed in their filth, they cursed and blasphemed as often as they groaned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>In the edge of the gaping ditches, which provoked the gorge to look at, there were many of the sick people, who, unable to leave, rested there for hours, and made their condition hopeless by breathing the stenchful atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>He was gentlemanly and white-haired, which, added to his unvarying benevolence and politeness, caused him to be regarded by me as something of an agreeable wonder in that pestful yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>But it was useless to try and influence me by political reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>In the first place, I was too ignorant in politics, and too slow of comprehension, to follow his reasonings; in the second place, every American friend of mine was a Southerner, and my adopted father was a Southerner, and I was blind through my gratitude; and, in the third place, I had a secret scorn for people who could kill <num value="1">one</num> another for the sake of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>As I had seen him in the <rs>South</rs>, he was <num value="0.5">a half</num>-savage, who had been exported by his own countrymen, and sold in open market, agreeable to time-honoured custom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>But, so far as I knew of the matter, it was only the accident of a presidential election which had involved the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> in a civil war, and I could not take it upon me to do anything more than stand by my friends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>These were the increase in sickness, the horrors of the prison, the oily atmosphere, the ignominious cartage of the dead, the useless flight of time, the fear of being incarcerated for years, which so affected my spirits that I felt a few more days of these scenes would drive me mad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>A friend of the family came into my room <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>this afternoon, and was, in features, voice, and conduct, infectiously congratulatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>He told me that the marriage was as good as concluded, that I had only to name the day. I gasped, and with good reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Here was an event which I had always considered as sacred, mysterious, requiring peculiar influences and circumstances to bring within range of possibilities, so imminent, that it depended only on my own wish.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>In the evening I visited the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>I was allowed to see <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and, in a short time, whatever misgivings I may have had as to the wisdom of my act were banished by the touch of her hand, and the trust visible in her eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>There was no doubt as to her ultimate responsiveness to the height and depth of love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>As yet, naturally, there was no love; but it was budding, and, if allowed to expand, there would be no flaw in the bloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>If I know myself at all, I think that my condition was much the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>All that I knew of her I admired; and, if she were as constant in goodness as she was beautiful, there would be no reason to regret having been so precipitate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>From these rapid reflections I was recalled by the mother's remarks, which in a short time satisfied me that the marriage was not so positively determined upon as I had been led to believe that afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>As she went on I perceived it was not settled at all. The same fear I had felt, of committing an imprudence, was swaying her.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>The wisdom of this act I could not but applaud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>The mother was just and prudent, and my respect for her increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/><pb id="p.236" n="236"/>Still, it was tantalising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>My decision to marry, though so quickly arrived at, cost me a struggle and some grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>My independence I valued greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>Freedom was so precious to me. To be able to wander where I liked, at a moment's thought, with only a portmanteau to look after, I should not have bartered for a fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>But now, after looking into the face of such a sweet girl as <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and seeing her readiness to be my companion, for better, or for worse, and believing that she would not hinder my movements, the disagreeability of being wedded had been removed, and I had been brought to look upon the event as rather desirable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>Many people have greeted me, and expressed their wish that it should be a happy <num value="1">one</num>, and that I should see many more such days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>They were no doubt sincere, but what avail their wishes, and what is happiness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>What a curious custom it is, to take this day, above all others, to speak of happiness, when inwardly each must think in his soul that it admonishes him of the lapse of time, and what enormous arrears there still remain to make up the sum of his happiness!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>As for me, I know not what I lack to make me happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>Therefore, take care to keep that health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>The knowledge that every moment makes me older, the fluctuations to which the spirit is subject, hour by hour, for ever remind me that happiness is not to be secured in this world, except for brief periods; and, for a houseless, friendless fellow like myself, those periods when we cast off all thought which tends to vex the mind cannot, by any possibility, be frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>But, if to be happy is to be without sorrow, fear, anxiety, doubt, I have been happy; and, if I could find an island in mid-ocean, remote from the presence or reach of man, with a few necessaries sufficient to sustain life, I might be happy yet; for then I could forget what reminds me of unhappiness, and, when death came, I should accept it as a long sleep and rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>But, as this wish of mine cannot be gratified, I turn to what many will do to-day; meditate; think with regret of all the things left undone that ought to have been done; of words said that ought not to have been uttered; of vile thoughts that stained the mind; and resolve, with <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> help, to be better, nobler, purer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>I had taken with me my Bible, and the <rs>American</rs> consul had given me, to pack up bottles of medicine with, a great many <quote>New York Heralds,</quote> and other American newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>Strange connection!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/>But yet strangest of all was the change <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>wrought in me by the reading of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and these newspapers in melancholy <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>My sicknesses were frequent, and, during my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attacks of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> fever, I took up the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> to while away the tedious, feverish hours in bed. Though incapacitated from the march, my temperature being constantly at <num value="105">105</num>&deg; Fahr., it did not prevent me from reading, when not light-headed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>I read <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>, and then the <name>Psalms</name>; and when I recovered and was once more in marching state, I occupied my mind in camp in glancing at the newspaper intelligence; and then, somehow or another, my views towards newspapers were entirely recast; not as regards my own profession, which I still esteemed very highly, perhaps too highly, but as to the use and abuse of newspapers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>Solitude taught me many things, and showed newspapers in quite a new light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>There were several subjects treated in a manner that wild nature seemed to scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>It appeared to me that the reading of anything in the newspapers, except that for which they were intended, namely news, was a waste of time; and deteriorative of native force, and worth, and personality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>The <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, however, with its noble and simple language, I continued to read with a higher and truer understanding than I had ever before conceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>Its powerful verses had a different meaning, a more penetrative influence, in the silence of the wilds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>I came to feel a strange glow while absorbed in its pages, and a charm peculiarly appropriate to the deep melancholy of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> scenery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>When I laid down the book, the mind commenced to feed upon what memory suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>Then rose the ghosts of by-gone yearnings, haunting every cranny of the brain with numbers of baffled hopes and unfulfilled aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>Here was I, only a poor journalist, with no friends, and yet possessed by a feeling of power to achieve!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>How could it ever be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>Then verses of Scripture rang iteratingly through my mind as applicable to my own being, sometimes full of promise, often of solemn warning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>Alone in my tent, unseen of men, my mind laboured and worked upon itself, and nothing was so soothing and sustaining as when I remembered the long-neglected comfort and support of lonely childhood and boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/>I flung myself on <pb id="p.254" n="254"/>my knees, and poured out my soul utterly in secret prayer to Him from whom I had been so long estranged, to Him who had led me here mysteriously into <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, there to reveal Himself, and His will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>I became then inspired with fresh desire to serve Him to the utmost, that same desire which in early days in New Orleans filled me each morning, and sent me joyfully skipping to my work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>As seen in my loneliness, there was this difference between the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>The <num value="1">one</num> reminded me that, apart from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, my life was but a bubble of air, and it bade me remember my Creator; the other fostered arrogance and worldliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>When that vast upheaved sky, and mighty circumference of tree-clad earth, or sere downland, marked so emphatically my personal littleness, I felt often so subdued that my black followers might have discerned, had they been capable of reflection, that <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> was changing me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>It may be taken for granted that some of the newspaper issues which I took up, <num value="1">one</num> after another, when examined under this new light, were uncommonly poor specimens of journalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>Though all contained some facts appertaining to the progress of the world's affairs, in which every intelligent man ought to be concerned, these were so few and meagre that they were overwhelmed by the vast space devoted to stupid personalities, which were either offensively flattering or carpingly derogatory; and there came columns of crime records, and mere gutter-matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>It was during these days I learned that, as teeth were given to chew our bread, and taste to direct our sense of its quality, so knowledge and experience were capable of directing the judgement; and from that period to this, I have never allowed another to govern my decisions upon the character of any person, or to pervert my own ideas as to the rights and wrongs of a matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3647"/>I find, if <num value="1">one</num> wishes to be other than a mere number, he must learn to exercise his own discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>I have practised these rules ever since, and I remember my delight when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> found that this method had so trained and expanded my judgement that my views upon things affecting other people, or affairs in which I had no personal concern, were in harmony with those expressed by the best leading journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>I was but a few days in the wilderness, on the other side of the <placeName reg="Kingani River">Kingani River</placeName>, when it dawned upon me with a most sobering effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>He saw that I was outwardly human, but his desire to know whether my faculties and usages were human as well was very evident, and until it was gratified by the putting of my hand into his and speaking to him, his doubt was manifest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>To think of self, friends, banking-account, <rs n="life insurance" type="product">life-insurance</rs>, or any worldly interest but the <num value="1">one</num> sole purpose of reaching the spot where <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00255.00859" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> might happen to rest, could only tend to weaken resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>Intense application to my task assisted me to forget all I had left behind, and all that might lie ahead in the future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>In some ways, it produced a delightful tranquillity which was foreign to me while in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>To be indifferent to the obituaries the papers may publish to-morrow, that never even a thought should glance across the mind of law-courts, jails, tombstones; not to care what may disturb a Parliament, or a Congress, or the state of the <name>Funds</name>, or the nerves excited about earthquakes, floods, wars, and other national evils, is a felicity few educated men in Britain know; and it compensated me in a great measure for the distress from heat, meagreness of diet, malaria, and other ills, to which I became subject soon after entering <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>Every day added something to my experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>I saw that <pb id="p.256" n="256"/>exciting adventures could not happen so often as I had anticipated, that the fevers in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> were less frequent than in some parts of the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>, that game was not visible on every acre, and that the ambushed savage was rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>There were quite as many bright pictures to be met with as there were dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>Troubles taught patience, and with the exercise of patience came greater self-control and experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>My ideas respecting my Zanzibari and Unyamwezi followers were modified after a few weeks' observation and trials of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>Certain vices and follies, which clung to their uneducated natures, were the source of great trouble; though there were brave virtues in most of them, which atoned for much that appeared incorrigible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>With such authorities it is somewhat bold, perhaps, to disagree; but after experiences of <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00256.00862" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pocock,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00256.00863" reg="mostcommon:Pocock,Frank,,,:4"><surname>Pocock</surname></persName>, <persName n="Swinburne,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00256.00864" reg="mostcommon:Swinburne,A.,B.,,:2"><surname>Swinburne</surname></persName>, <persName n="Parke,Surgeon,,,," id="n0103.0017.00256.00865" reg="mostcommon:Parke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon">Surgeon</roleName> <surname>Parke</surname></persName>, and other white men, <num value="1">one</num> must not take these remarks too literally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>As for my black followers, no quality was so conspicuous and unvarying as good-temper; and I think that, since I had more occasion to praise my black followers than blame them, even I must surely take credit for being more often good-tempered than bad; and besides, I felt great compassion for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>How often the verse in the <name>Psalms</name> recurred to me: <quote>Like as a father pitieth his own children</quote> !</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>It was on my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expedition that I felt I was ripening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>Hitherto, my faculties had been too busy in receiving impressions; but, like the young corn which greedily absorbs the rain and cool dews, and, on approaching maturity, begins to yellow under summer suns, so I began to feel the benefit of the myriad impressions, and I grew to govern myself with more circumspection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>On the <dateStruct value="1871-05-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1871</year>,</dateStruct> we began to ascend the <name>Usagara</name> range, and, in <num value="8">eight</num> marches, we arrived on the verge of the dry, rolling, and mostly wooded plateau, which continues, almost without change, for nearly <measure n="600miles" type="distance">six hundred miles</measure> west-ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>We soon after entered Ugogo, inhabited by a bumptious, full-chested, square-shouldered people, who exact heavy <pb id="p.257" n="257"/>tribute from all caravans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/><num value="9">Nine</num> marches took us through their country; and, when we finally shook the dust of its red soil off our feet, we were rich in the experience of native manners and arrogance, but considerably poorer in means.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>Beyond Ugogo undulated the <name>Land</name> of the <rs>Moon</rs>, or Unyamwezi, inhabited by a turbulent and combative race, who are as ready to work for those who can afford to pay as they are ready to fight those they consider unduly aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>Towards the middle of this land, we came to a colony of Arab settlers and traders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>Some of these had built excellent and spacious houses of sun-dried brick, and cultivated extensive gardens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>The <rs>Arabs</rs> located here were great travellers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>Every region round about the colony had been diligently searched by them for ivory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>If <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00257.00866" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> was anywhere within reach, some of these people ought surely to have known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>But, although I questioned eagerly all whom I became acquainted with, no <num value="1">one</num> could give me definite information of the missing man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>I was preparing to leave the <name>Arab</name> colony in Unyanyembe when war broke out between the settlers and a native chief, named Mirambo, and a series of sanguinary contests followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>In the hope that, by adding my force to that of the <name>Arabs</name>, a route west might be opened, I, foolishly enough, joined them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>I did not succeed in my enterprise, however, and a disastrous retreat followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/>The country became more and more disturbed; bandits infested every road leading from the colony; cruel massacres, destruction of villages, raids by predatory Watuta, were daily reported to me; until it seemed to me that there was neither means for advance nor retreat left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3684"/>As my expedition had become thoroughly disorganized during my flight with the <name>Arabs</name> from the fatal campaign against Mirambo, I turned my attention to form another, which, whether I should continue my search for the lost traveller, or abandon it, and turn my face homeward, would be equally necessary; and, as during such an unquiet period it would be a task requiring much time and patience, I mean-while consulted my charts, and the best informed natives, as to the possibility of evading the hostile bands of Mirambo by taking a circuitous route round the disturbed territory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3685"/>Finally, on the <dateStruct value="1871-09-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month>, <year>1871</year>,</dateStruct> I set out from the <pb id="p.258" n="258"/>Arab settlement at Kwihara to resume the journey so long interrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3686"/>I had been detained <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> at Unyanyembe by an event totally unlooked &mdash; for when the expedition left the sea. Almost every day of this interval had witnessed trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>Some troubles had attained the magnitude of public and private calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>Many Arab friends had been massacred; many of my own people either had been slain in battle or had perished from disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>Over <num value="40">forty</num> had deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/><num value="1">One</num> of my white companions was dead; the other had become a mere burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>All the transport animals but <num value="2">two</num> had died; days of illness from fever had alternated with days of apparent good health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>My joys had been few indeed, but my miseries many; yet this day, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> expedition that I had organised, through great good fortune numbered nearly <num value="60">sixty</num> picked men, almost all of whom were well armed, and loaded with every necessary that was portable, bound to demonstrate if somewhere in the wild western lands the lost traveller lived, or was dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>The conclusion I had arrived at was, that, though Mirambo and his hordes effectually closed the usual road to <placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName>, a flank march might be made, sufficiently distant from the disturbed territory and sufficiently long to enable me to strike west, and make another attempt to reach the <name>Arab</name> colony on <placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>I calculated that from <num value="200">two hundred</num> to <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure> extra marching would enable me to reach <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName> safely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>Agreeably to this determination, for <measure n="22days" type="date">twenty-two days</measure> we travelled in a south-westerly direction, during which I estimated we had performed a journey of <measure n="240miles" type="distance">two hundred and forty miles</measure>. At a place called Mpokwa, Mirambo's capital lying due north <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> distant, I turned westward, and after <measure n="35miles" type="distance">thirty-five miles</measure>, gradually turned a little to the westward of north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>At the <num value="105" type="ordinal">105th</num> mile of this northerly journey we came to the ferry of the <placeName reg="Malagarazi River">Malagarazi River</placeName>, Mirambo being, at that point, <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> march direct east of us, from whence I took a north-westerly course, straight for the port of the <name>Arab</name> colony on the great <rs>Lake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/>With the exception of a mutiny among my own people, which was soon forcibly crushed, and considerable suffering from famine, I had met with no adventures which detained me, or interrupted my rapid advance on the <rs type="place">Lake</rs>. <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>At the river just mentioned, however, a rumour reached me, by a native caravan, of a white man having reached <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName> from Manyuema, a country situated a few <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> west of the lake, which startled us all greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>The caravan did not stay long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>The ferriage of the river is always exciting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>The people were natives of West Tanganyika.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>The evidence, such as it was,--brief, and given in a language few of my people could understand,--was conclusive that the stranger was elderly, grey-bearded, white, and that he was a man wearing clothes somewhat of the pattern of those I wore; that he had been at <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName> before, but had been years absent in the western country; and that he had only arrived either the same day they had left <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName> with their caravan, or the day before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>To my mind, startling as it was to me, it appeared that he could be no other than <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00259.00867" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>True, <persName n="Baker,Sir,Samuel,,," id="n0103.0017.00259.00868" reg="default:Baker,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Baker</surname></persName> was known to be in <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242"><rs type="direction">Central</rs> Africa</placeName> in the neighbourhood of the <rs type="place">Nile lakes</rs> &mdash; but he was not grey-bearded; a traveller might have arrived from the <rs type="place">West Coast</rs>,--he might be a Portuguese, a German, or a Frenchman,--but then none of these had ever been heard of in the neighbourhood of <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>Therefore, as fast as doubts arose as to his personality, arguments were as quickly found to dissipate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>Quickened by the hope that was inspired in my mind by this vague rumour, I crossed the <placeName reg="Malagarazi River">Malagarazi River</placeName>, and soon after entered the country of the factious and warlike Wahha.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>A series of misfortunes commenced at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> village we came to in Uhha.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>I was summoned to halt, and to pay such a tribute as would have beggared me had I yielded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>To reduce it, however, was a severe task and strain on my patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>I had received no previous warning that I should be subjected to such extortionate demands, which made the matter worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>The inevitable can always be endured, if due notice is given; but the suddenness of a mishap or an evil rouses the combative instincts in man. Before paying, or even submitting to the thought of payment, my power of resistance was carefully weighed, but I became inclined to moderation upon being assured by all concerned that this would be the only instance of what must be endured unless we chose to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>After long hours of haggling over the amount, I paid my forfeit, and was permitted to proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/><pb id="p.260" n="260"/></p> 
<p>The next day I was again halted, and summoned to pay. The present demand was for <measure n="2barrels" type="mass">two bales</measure> of cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>This led to half-formed resolutions to resist to the death, then anxious conjectures as to what would be the end of this rapacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>The manner of the <name>Wahha</name> was confident and supercilious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>This could only arise from the knowledge that, whether their demands were agreeable or not to the white man, the refusal to pay could but result in gain to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>After hours of attempts to reduce the sum total, I submitted to pay <num value="1">one</num> bale and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>Again I was assured this would be the last.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>The next day I rose at dawn to resume the march; but, <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> later, we were halted again, and forfeited another half-bale, notwithstanding the most protracted and patient haggling on my part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>And for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time I was assured we were safe from further demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/>The natives and my own people combined to comfort me with this assurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>I heard, however, shortly after, that Uhha extended for <num value="2">two</num> long marches yet, further west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>Knowing this, I declined to believe them, and began to form plans to escape from Uhha.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>I purchased <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> rations as a provision for the wilderness, and at <time value="12am">midnight</time> I roused the caravan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>Having noiselessly packed the goods, the people silently stole away from the sleeping village in small groups, and the guides were directed, as soon as we should be a little distance off, to abandon the road and march to the southward over the grassy plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>After <measure n="18hours" type="date">eighteen hours</measure> marching through an unpeopled wilderness, we were safe beyond Uhha and the power of any chief to exact tribute, or to lay down the arbitrary law, <quote> Fight, or pay.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>A small stream now crossed was the boundary line between hateful Uhha and peaceful Ukaranga.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>We were in a hilly country, thickly-wooded, towering trees nodding their heads far above, tall bush filling darkly the shade, the road winding like a serpent, narrow and sinuous, the hollows all musical with the murmur of living waters and their sibilant echoes, the air cool and fragrant with the smell of strange flowers and sweet gums.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>Then, my mind lightened with pleasant presentiments, and conscience complaisantly approving what I had done hitherto, you can imagine the vigour of our pace in that cool and charming twilight of the forest shades!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>About <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> we were climbing the side of a steep and wooded hill, and we presently stood on the very crest of it, and on the furthest edge looked out into a realm of light &mdash; wherein I saw, as in a painted picture, a vast lake in the distance below, with its face luminous as a mirror, set in a frame of dimly-blue mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>On the further side they seemed to be of appalling height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>On the hither side they rose from low hills lining the shore, in advancing lines, separated by valleys, until they terminated at the base of that tall mountain-brow whereon I stood, looking down from my proud height, with glad eyes and exultant feelings, upon the whole prospect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>On our admiring people, who pressed eagerly forward to gaze upon the scene, contentment diffused itself immediately, inspiring a boisterous good-humour; for it meant a crowning rest from their daily round of miles, and a holiday from the bearing of burdens, certainly an agreeable change from the early reveille, and hard fare of the road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>With thoughts still gladder, if possible, than ever, the caravan was urged down the descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>The lake grew larger into view, and smiled a broad welcome to us, until we lost sight of it in the valley below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>For hours I strode nervously on, tearing through the cane-brakes of the valleys, brushing past the bush on the hill-slopes and crests, flinging gay remarks to the wondering villagers, who looked on the almost flying column in mute surprise, until near <time value="12pm">noon</time>, when, having crossed the last valley and climbed up to the summit of the last hill, lo!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/><placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName> was distant from us but half a mile!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>Before such a scene I must halt once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>To me, a lover <pb id="p.262" n="262"/>of the sea, its rolling waves, its surge and its moan, the grand lake recalls my long-forgotten love!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>I look enraptured upon the magnificent expanse of fresh water, and the white-tipped billows of the inland sea. I see the sun and the clear white sky reflected a <num value="1000000">million</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> times upon the dancing waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>I hear the sounding surge on the pebbled shore, I see its crispy edge curling over, and creeping up the land, to return again to the watery hollows below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>I see canoes, far away from the shore, lazily rocking on the undulating face of the lake, and at once the sight appeals to the memories of my men who had long ago handled the net and the paddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>Hard by the lake shore, embowered in palms, on this hot noon, the village of <placeName reg="Ujiji,Kigoma,Tanzania,Africa" key="tgn,7016574">Ujiji</placeName> broods drowsily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>No living thing can be seen moving to break the stilly aspect of the outer lines of the town and its deep shades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>The green-swarded hill on which I stood descended in a gentle slope to the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>The path was seen, of an ochreous-brown, curving down the face of the hill until it entered under the trees into the town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>I rested awhile, breathless from my exertions; and, as the stragglers were many, I halted to re-unite and re-form for an imposing entry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>Meantime, my people improved their personal appearance; they clothed themselves in clean dresses, and snowy cloths were folded round their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>When the laggards had all been gathered, the guns were loaded to rouse up the sleeping town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>It is an immemorial custom, for a caravan creeps not up into a friendly town like a thief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>Our braves knew the custom well; they therefore volleyed and thundered their salutes as they went marching down the hill slowly, and with much self-contained dignity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>Presently, there is a tumultuous stir visible on the outer edge of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>Groups of men in white dresses, with arms in their hands, burst from the shades, and seem to hesitate a moment, as if in doubt; they then come rushing up to meet us, pursued by hundreds of people, who shout joyfully, while yet afar, their noisy welcomes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>The foremost, who come on bounding up, cry out: <quote>Why, we took you for Mirambo and his bandits, when we heard the booming of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>It is an age since a caravan has come to <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>.

<p>Being told it was a white man's caravan by the guides in front, the boisterous multitude pressed up to me, greeted me with salaams, and bowed their salutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>Hundreds of them jostled and trod on <num value="1">one</num> another's heels as they each strove to catch a look at the master of the caravan; and I was about asking <num value="1">one</num> of the nearest to me whether it was true that there was a white man in <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>, who was just come from the countries west of the <rs type="place">Lake</rs>, when a tall black man, in long white shirt, burst impulsively through the crowd on my right, and bending low, said,--</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3782"/>The same idea striking Susi's mind, he undertook in his impulsive manner to inform the <rs>Doctor</rs>, and I saw him racing headlong, with his white dress streaming behind him like a wind-whipped pennant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3783"/>The column continued on its way, beset on either flank by a vehemently-enthusiastic and noisily-rejoicing mob, which bawled a jangling chorus of <q direct="unspecified">Yambos</q> to every mother's son of us, and maintained an inharmonious orchestral music of drums and horns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>I was indebted for this loud ovation to the cheerful relief the people felt that we were not Mirambo's bandits, and to their joy at the happy rupture of the long silence that had perforce existed between the <num value="2">two</num> trading <pb id="p.264" n="264"/>colonies of Unyanyembe and <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>, and because we brought news which concerned every householder and freeman of this lake port.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>After a few minutes we came to a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>The guides in the van had reached the market-place, which was the central point of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3787"/>For there the great <rs>Arabs</rs>, chiefs, and respectabilities of <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>, had gathered in a group to await events; thither also they had brought with them the venerable <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> traveller who was at that time resting among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>The caravan pressed up to them, divided itself into <num value="2">two</num> lines on either side of the road, and, as it did so, disclosed to me the prominent figure of an elderly white man clad in a <rs n="red flannel" type="product">red flannel</rs> blouse, grey trousers, and a blue cloth, gold-banded cap.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>Up to this moment my mind had verged upon non-belief in his existence, and now a nagging doubt intruded itself into my mind that this white man could not be the object of my quest, or if he were, he would somehow contrive to disappear before my eyes would be satisfied with a view of him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3790"/>Consequently, though the expedition was organized for this supreme moment, and every movement of it had been confidently ordered with the view of discovering him, yet when the moment of discovery came, and the man himself stood revealed before me, this constantly recurring doubt contributed not a little to make me unprepared for it. <quote>It may not be <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00264.00874" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> after all,</quote> doubt suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>If this is he, what shall I say to him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3792"/>My imagination had not taken this question into consideration before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3793"/>All around me was the immense crowd, hushed and expectant, and wondering how the scene would develop itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>Under all these circumstances I could do no more than exercise some restraint and reserve, so I walked up to him, and, doffing my helmet, bowed and said in an inquiring tone,--</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>At various times I have remarked that the question most frequently given to me has been: <quote>Why did not <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00267.00885" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> return of his own accord when he found his energies waning, age creeping on him and fettering him in its strong bonds, his means so reduced that he was unable to accomplish anything, even if youth could have been restored to him?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>Briefly, I will answer that his return to home and kindred was prevented by an over-scrupulous fidelity to a promise that he had made to his friend <persName n="Murchison,Sir,R.,,," id="n0103.0017.00267.00886" reg="expanded:Murchison,Roderick,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Murchison</surname></persName>--that he would set the matter of that watershed north of the <name>Tanganyika</name> at rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>But, strive as he might, misfortune dogged him; dauntlessly he urged his steps forward over the high plateaus between Nyasa and Tanganyika, but, steadily, evil, in various disguises, haunted him. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, his transport animals died, his <pb id="p.268" n="268"/><name>Indian</name> escort malingered, and halted, faint-hearted, on the road, until they were dismissed; then his <persName><foreName>Johanna</foreName></persName> escort played the same trick and deserted him, after which his porters under various pretences absconded; the natives took advantage of his weakness, and tyrannised over him at every opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>A canoe capsized on <placeName reg="Lake Bangweolo">Lake Bangweolo</placeName>, which accident deprived him of his medicine-chest; then, malarial diseases, finding the body now vulnerable and open to attack, assailed him, poisoned his blood, and ravished his strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>Malignant ulcers flourished on the muscles of his limbs, dysentery robbed him of the vital constituent of his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>Still, after a time, he rose from his sick-bed, and pressed on unfalteringly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>The watershed, when he reached it, grew to be a tougher problem than he had conceived it to be. On the northern slope, a countless multitude of streams poured northward, into an enormously wide valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>At its lowest depression, they were met by others, rushing to meet them from the <name>north</name> and <name>east</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>United, they formed a river of such volume and current that he paused in wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>So remote from all known rivers &mdash; Nile, <persName n="Niger,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00268.00887" reg="mostcommon:Niger,nomatch:0"><surname>Niger</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Congo, Africa, " key="tgn,7017971">Congo</placeName> &mdash; and yet so large!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>Heedless of his beggared state, forgetful of his past miseries, unconscious of his weakness, his fidelity to his promise drives him on with the zeal of an honourable fanatic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>He <hi rend="italics">must</hi> fulfil his promise, or die in the attempt!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>We, lapped as we are in luxury, feeding on the daintiest diet, affecting an epicurean cynicism, with the noble virtues of our youth and earlier life blunted from too close contact with animal pleasures, can only smile contemptuously, compassionating these morbid ideas of honour!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>This man, however, verging upon old age, is so beset by these severely-rigid scruples of his that he <hi rend="italics">must</hi> go on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>He traces that voluminous river until it enters a shallow lake called Bangweolo, which spreads out on either hand beyond sight, like a sea. He attempts to navigate it; his intention is frustrated by a calamity &mdash; the last of his medicines are lost, his instruments are damaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>He determines to go by land, reaches <persName><foreName>Cazembe</foreName></persName>, and by the natives he is told of other lakes and rivers without end, all trending northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/>He directs his steps <name>north</name> and <name>west</name> to gather the clues to the <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>riverine labyrinth, until he is, perforce, halted by utter exhaustion of his means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>He meets an Arab, begs a loan for mere subsistence; and, on that account, must needs march whither the <name>Arab</name> goes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>Hearing of a caravan bound coastward, he writes a letter to <placeName reg="Zanzibar Island, Tanzania, Africa" key="tgn,6006673">Zanzibar</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, and directs that goods should be sent to him at <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>; and, bidding his soul possess itself with patience, he wanders with the <name>Arab</name> merchant for a whole year, and, in <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>, arrives at <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>There is nothing there for him; but a draft on <placeName reg="Zanzibar Island, Tanzania, Africa" key="tgn,6006673">Zanzibar</placeName> suffices to purchase, at an extortionate charge, a few bags of beads and a few bales of cloth, with which he proposes to march due west to strike that great river discovered <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before so far south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>This is loyalty to a friend with a vengeance!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3864"/>The friend to whom he had given his promise, had he but known to what desperate straits the old man was reduced, would long ago have absolved him. <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00269.00888" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> was now in his <num value="57" type="ordinal">fifty-seventh</num> year, toothless, ill-clad, a constant victim to disease, meagre and gaunt from famine: but <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00269.00889" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>'s word was not a thing to be obliterated by forgetfulness &mdash; he had made it his creed, and resolved to be true to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>Well, this insatiable zeal for his word demands that he proceed due west, to find this river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>He travels until within a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> of it, when he is stricken down by <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> ulcers of a peculiarly virulent type, which confine him to his bed for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>During this forced rest, his few followers become utterly demoralised; they refuse to stay with a man who seems bent on self-destruction, and so blind, they say, that he will not see he is marching to his doom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3868"/><dateStruct value="-9-"><month reg="9">The ninth month</month></dateStruct> brings relief &mdash; his body is cured, a small re-enforcement of men appear before him, in answer to the letter he had sent in <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3869"/>The new men inform him they have only come to convey him back to the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3870"/>He repudiates the insinuation their words convey with indignant warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3871"/>He buys their submission by liberal largesse, and resumes his interrupted journey westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3872"/>In a few days, he arrives at the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1126412" n="1.000 10" reg="Lualaba,Congo,Africa">Lualaba</placeName>, which is now <measure n="2000yards" type="distance">two thousand yards</measure> wide, deep, and flowing strong still northward, at a point <measure n="1300miles" type="distance">thirteen hundred miles</measure> from its source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3873"/>The natives as well as the <name>Arab</name> traders <pb id="p.270" n="270"/>unite in the statement that, as far as their acquaintance with it is, its course is northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3874"/>The problem becomes more and more difficult, and its resolution is ever elusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3875"/>His instruments make it only <measure n="2000feet" type="distance">two thousand feet</measure> above the sea &mdash; the <rs>Nile</rs>, <measure n="600miles" type="distance">six hundred miles</measure> northward, is also <measure n="2000feet" type="distance">two thousand feet</measure>! How can this river be the <rs>Nile</rs>, then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/>Yet its course is northward and Nileward,--has been northward and Nileward ever since it left <placeName reg="Bangweolo Lake">Bangweolo Lake</placeName>, <measure n="700miles" type="distance">seven hundred miles</measure> south of where he stands,--and, for many weeks' travel along its banks, all reports prove that it continues its northerly flow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3877"/>To settle this exasperating puzzle, he endeavours to purchase canoes for its navigation; but his men become rebellious and frantic in their opposition, and <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00270.00890" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> finds that every attempt he makes is thwarted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>While hesitating what to do, he receives a letter, which informs him that another caravan has arrived for him at <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3879"/>He resolves to journey back to <placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName>, and dismiss these obstinate and mutinous followers of his; and, with new men, carefully chosen, return to this interesting field, and explore it until he discovers the bourn of that immense river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3880"/>He arrives at <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName> about the <dateStruct value="1871-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month>, <year>1871</year>,</dateStruct> only to find that his caravan has been disbanded, and the goods sold by its chief; in other words, that his present state is worse than ever!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>He is now in his <num value="59" type="ordinal">fifty-ninth</num> year, far away from the scene of his premeditated labours; the sea, where he might have rest and relief from these continually-repeating misfortunes, though only <measure n="900miles" type="distance">nine hundred miles</measure> off, is as inaccessible as the moon to him, because Mirambo and his bandits are carrying on a ravaging and desolating war throughout all the region east of <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>The <rs>Arabs</rs> of the colony have no comfort to impart to him, for they, too, feel the doom of isolation impending over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>Over and over again, they have despatched scouts eastward, and each time these have returned with the authentic news that all routes to the sea are closed by sanguinary brigandage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>Not knowing how long this period may last, the <name>Arabs</name> practise the strictest economy; they have neither cloth nor bead currency to lend, however large may be the interest offered for the loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>But, as the position of the old man has become desperate, and he and his few followers may die of <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>starvation, if no relief be given, Sayed bin Majid and <persName><foreName>Mohammed</foreName></persName> bin Gharib advance a few dozen cloths to him, which, with miserly economy, may suffice to purchase food for a month.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/>And then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3887"/>Ah! then the prospect will be blank indeed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3888"/>However, <quote>Thy will be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>When fatigued by his constrained position on the clay floor in that east-facing verandah, he would lift his heavy Journal from his lap, and, with hand to chin, sit for hours in his brooding moods, thinking, ever thinking &mdash; mind ever revolving the prayer, <quote>How long, <num value="0">0</num> <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, must Thy servant bear all this?</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>The town was wakened from its <hi rend="italics">siesta</hi> by the alarming sound of firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>The inhabitants hurriedly issued out of their homes somewhat frightened, asking <num value="1">one</num> another if it were Mirambo and his bandits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>The general suspicion that the strangers could be no other than the ubiquitous <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> chief and his wild men caused all to lay their hands on their arms and prepare for the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>The boldest, creeping cautiously out of the town, see a caravan descending slowly towards <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>, bearing the <name>Zanzibar</name> and American flags in front, and rush back shouting out the news that the strangers are friends from <placeName reg="Zanzibar Island, Tanzania, Africa" key="tgn,6006673">Zanzibar</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>In a few minutes the news becomes more definite: people say that it is a white man's caravan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/>Looking out upon the market-place from his verandah, <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00271.00893" reg="mostcommon:Livingstone,David,,,:3"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> is, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, aware of the excitement which the sudden firing is causing; <pb id="p.272" n="272"/>but if it be Mirambo, as all suspect it to be, it does not matter much to him, for he is above the miserable fear of death; violent as it may be, it will be but a happy release from the afflictions of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>Soon, however, men cried out to him, <quote>Joy, old master, it is a white man's caravan; it may belong to a friend of thine.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3916"/>The effect of the meeting was a rapid restoration to health he was also placed above want, for he had now stores in abundance sufficient to have kept him in comfort in <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3928"/>I conclude, from the importance he attaches to these, that he is more interested in ethnology than in topographical geography.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>He preached no sermon, by word of mouth, while I was in company with him; but each day of my companionship with him witnessed a sermon acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>The Divine instructions, given of old on the <rs>Sacred Mount</rs>, were closely followed, day by day, whether he rested in the jungle-camp, or bided in the traders' town, or savage hamlet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>Lowly of spirit, meek in speech, merciful of heart, pure in mind, and peaceful in act, suspected by the <name>Arabs</name> to be an informer, and therefore calumniated, often offended at evils committed by his own servants, but ever forgiving, often robbed and thwarted, yet bearing no ill-will, cursed by the marauders, yet physicking their infirmities, most despitefully used, yet praying daily for all manner and condition of men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>Narrow, indeed, was the way of eternal life that he elected to follow, and few are those who choose it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>Though friends became indifferent to his fate, associates neglectful, and his servants mocked and betrayed him, though suitable substance was denied to him, and though the rain descended in torrents on him in his wanderings, and the tropic tempests beat him sore, and sickened him with their rigours, he toiled on, and laboured ever in the <name>Divine</name> service he had chosen, unyielding and unresting, for the <rs>Christian</rs> man's faith was firm that <quote>all would come right at last.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>Had my soul been of brass, and my heart of spelter, the powers of my head had surely compelled me to recognise, with due honour, the <name>Spirit</name> of Goodness which manifested itself in him. Had there been anything of the <name>Pharisee</name> or the hypocrite in him, or had I but traced a grain of meanness or guile in him, I had surely turned away a sceptic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>But my every-day study of him, during health or sickness, deepened my reverence and increased my esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>He was, in short, consistently noble, upright, pious, and manly, all the days of my companionship with him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>He professed to be a Liberal Presbyterian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>Presbyterianism I have heard of, and have read much about it; but Liberal Presbyterianism,--whence is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>What special country throughout the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British Isles</placeName> is its birthplace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>Are there any more disciples of that particular creed, or was <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00281.00926" reg="nearbymention:Livingstone,May,,,"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> the last?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>I never discovered that there was any printed code of religious laws or moral precepts issued by his church, wherein these were specially alluded to; but it grew evident during our acquaintance that he erred not against any of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>Greater might he could not have shown in this interminable exploration set him by <persName n="Murchison,Sir,Roderick,,," id="n0103.0017.00282.00927" reg="default:Murchison,Roderick,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Roderick</foreName> <surname>Murchison</surname></persName>, because the work performed by him was beyond all proportion to his means and physical strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>What bread he ate was insufficient for his bodily nourishment, after the appalling fatigues of a march in a tropical land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>His conversation was serious, his demeanour grave and earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>Morn and eve he worshipped, and, at the end of every march, he thanked the <rs>Lord</rs> for His watchful <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>On <date value="--7">Sundays</date> he conducted Divine Service, and praised the glory of the <name>Creator</name>, the <name>True</name> <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to his dark followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>His hand was <pb id="p.283" n="283"/>clear of the stain of blood-guiltiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/>Profanity was an abomination to him. He was not indolent either in his <rs type="role2">Master</rs>'s service, or in the cause to which he was sacrificing himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>His life was an evidence that he served <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with all his heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>Nothing in the scale of humanity can be conceived lower than the tribes of Manyuema with whom he daily conversed as a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>Regardless of such honours as his country generally pays to exceeding merit, he continued his journeyings, bearing messages of peace wherever he went; and when he rested, chief and peasant among the long-neglected tribes ministered to his limited wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>Contented with performing his duty according as he was enabled to, such happiness as can be derived from righteous doings, pure thoughts, and a clear conscience, was undoubtedly his. His earnest labours for the sake of those in bonds, and the unhappy people who were a prey to the <name>Arab</name> kidnapper and land pirate, few will forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>The number of his appeals, the constant recurrence to the dismal topic, and the long lines of his travels, may be accepted as proofs of his heartiness and industry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>He was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to penetrate to those lands in the <placeName reg="Chambezi valley">Chambezi</placeName> and the <placeName reg="Lualaba valley">Lualaba valleys</placeName>; his was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> voice heard speaking in the hamlets of Eastern Sunda of the beauties of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion; and he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> preacher who dared denounce the red-handed Arab for his wickedly aggressive acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>In regions beyond ken of the most learned geographers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, he imitated the humility of the <name>Founder</name> of his religion, and spoke in fervent strains of the <name>Heavenly</name> message of peace and good-will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/>Should I ever return to the scenes that we knew together, my mind would instantaneously revert to the good man whom I shall never see more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4094"/>Be it a rock he sat upon, a tree upon which he rested, ground that he walked upon, or a house that he dwelt in, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought would naturally be that it was associated with him. But my belief is that they would flush my mind with the goodness and nobleness of his expression, appealing to me, though so silently, to remember, and consider, and strive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4095"/>I remember well when I gazed at <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>, <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> later, from the same hill as where I had announced the coming of my caravan: I had not been thinking much of him until that moment, <pb id="p.284" n="284"/>when, all at once, above the palm grove of <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>, and the long broad stretch of blue water of the lake beyond, loomed the form of <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0017.00284.00928" reg="nearbymention:Livingstone,May,,,"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>, in the well-remembered blue-grey coat of his marching costume, and the blue naval cap, gold-banded, regarding me with eyes so trustful, and face so grave and sad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>It is the expression of him that so follows and clings to me, and, indeed, is ever present when I think of him, though it is difficult to communicate to others the expression that I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> studied and that most attracted me. There was an earnest gravity in it; life long ago shorn of much of its beauty &mdash; I may say of all its vulgar beauty and coarser pleasures, a mind long abstracted from petty discontents, by preference feeding on itself, almost glorifying in itself as all-sufficient to produce content; therefore a composure settled, calm, and trustful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4097"/>Even my presence was impotent to break him from his habit of abstraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4098"/>I might have taken a book to read, and was silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>If I looked up a few minutes later, I discovered him deeply involved in his own meditations, right forefinger bent, timing his thoughts, his eyes gazing far away into indefinite distance, brows puckered closely &mdash; face set, and resolute, now and then lips moving, silently framing words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/> <quote>What can he be thinking about?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>I used to wonder, and once I ventured to break the silence with,--</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>After which I invariably let him alone when in this mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>Sometimes these thoughts were humorous, and, his face wearing a smile, he would impart the reason with some comic story or adventure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>I have met few so quickly responsive to gaiety and the lighter moods, none who was more sociable, genial, tolerant, and humorous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>You must think of him as a contented soul, who had yielded himself with an entire and loving submission, and who laboured to the best of his means and ability, awakening to the toil of the day, and resigning himself, without the least misgiving, to the rest of the night; believing that the effect of his self-renunciation would not be altogether barren.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4114"/>The few lines given to the contest with Mirambo represent months of struggle with a bandit-chief, and with slippery allies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/>The <num value="3">three</num>-line mention of the joint exploration of <placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName> stands for <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> of adventurous voyaging, geographical discovery, and encounters with hostile or thievish natives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4116"/>Through the whole period <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0018.00285.00937" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> carried an immense and varied responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>He was not only commander, and chief of staff, but the whole staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>The discipline, commissariat, and medical care, of a force often numbering <num value="200">two hundred</num> and more, all fell on him. For his followers he had to take the part of doctor, and occasionally of nurse, sometimes including the most menial offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>Often he was prostrated by fever, and once, before finding <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0018.00285.00938" reg="nearbymention:Livingstone,May,,,"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>, he lay unconscious for a week.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4120"/>Problems of war and diplomacy confronted him. Shall he pay tribute, or resist?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4121"/>Shall he join forces with the friendly tribes, and fight the fierce and powerful Mirambo who blocks the way to <placeName key="tgn,7016574" n="1.000 1" reg="ujiji,kigoma,tanzania,africa">Ujiji</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4122"/>He fights, and his allies fail him at the pinch; so then he resorts to a long flanking march through unknown country, and literally circumvents his foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>So, for over a year, every faculty is kept at the highest tension.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4124"/>Along with the developing effect of the experience, comes the solitary communing with Nature, which brings a spiritual exaltation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4126"/>His return to civilisation was not altogether a genial home-coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4127"/>In a way, he had been more at home in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> than he found himself in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4130"/>Relatives and acquaintances of his early years became suddenly affectionate and acquisitive; greedy claims were made on his purse, which he would not wholly reject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4131"/>Worst of all, with the acclamations of the public which greeted him, were mingled expressions of doubt or disbelief, innuendoes, sneers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4138"/>Perhaps no great and eminent body of scholars escapes a touch of the <rs>Mutual-Admiration Society</rs>; there are shibboleths of nationality, of social class, of clan and coterie; and when an outsider steps on the stage, there is solemn wrinkling of official foreheads, and lifting of distinguished eyebrows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4428"/>A minute later, firing began, and the companies moved forward briskly, firing as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/>Then every axe-man was marched out, to cut the bush, and fortify the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4430"/>The savages were driven back for an hour, and a recall was sounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4431"/>No enemy being in sight, we occupied ourselves in making the camp impregnable, constructed <num value="4">four</num> towers, <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> high, to command all sides, and, filling them with marksmen, waited events.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4432"/>The day, and the night, passed quietly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4433"/>Our camp was unassailable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4434"/>I had only lost <num value="2">two</num> men so far. At <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, the enemy reappeared in good order, re-enforced in numbers, for the adjoining districts had responded to the war-cries we had heard pealing the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4435"/>They advanced confidently, probably <num value="2000">two thousand</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4436"/>The marksmen in the towers opened deliberately on them, and <num value="2">two</num> companies were marched out of camp, and deployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4437"/>A deadly fire was kept up for a few minutes, before which the enemy fell back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4438"/>A rush was made upon them, the natives fled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4439"/>I called back my people, and then formed out of these companies <num value="5">five</num> detachments of twenties, each under a chosen man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4440"/>Those remaining behind cleared the bush further, so that we might have an open view <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> all around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4441"/>Until late in the afternoon the fighting was kept up, messengers keeping me in contact with my people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4442"/>At <time value="4pm">4 P. M.</time>, the enemy having collected on the summit of a hill several miles away, my men retired upon our camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4443"/>Our losses amounted to <measure n="22" type="killed">twenty-two killed</measure>, and <measure n="3" type="wounded">three wounded</measure>. My effective force now numbered <num value="208">two hundred and eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4444"/>The camp was full of cattle, goats, fowls, milk, and grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4447"/>We waited within the camp; but, at <time value="9am">9 A. M.</time>, the natives advanced as before, more numerous than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4448"/>Despite the losses they had experienced, they must have been heartened by what we had suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4449"/>This explains their pertinacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4450"/>If we lost <num value="20">twenty</num> each day, <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> would end us all. It was thus they argued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4451"/>I, on the other hand, to prevent this constant drain, was resolved to finish the war on this day. Accordingly, when they appeared, we advanced upon them with <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> rifles; and, leaving only <num value="50">fifty</num> in the camp, delivered several volleys, and pursued them from village to village, setting fire to each as soon as captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4452"/>In close order, we made the circuit of the entire district of <placeName reg="Vinyata">Vinyata</placeName>, until we arrived at the stronghold of the tribe, on the summit of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4453"/>We halted a short time to breathe, and then assailed it by a rush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4454"/>The enemy fled precipitately, and we returned to camp, having lost but <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure> throughout the arduous day.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4459"/>Suppressing my grief as much as possible, I set about reducing the baggage, and burnt every possible superfluous article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>My crew sighed dolorously, and rowed like men bound to certain death, often casting wistful looks at me, as though I shared their doubts, and would order a return, and confess that the preparations were only an elaborate joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>The waves hissed as we tore along; leaping seas churned white, racing with us and clashing their tops with loud, engulfing sounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>The crew collapsed, and crouched with staring eyes into the bottom of the boat, and expected each upward heave, and sudden fall into the troughs, to be the end of the wild venture; but the boat, though almost drowned by the spray and foam, dashed gaily along, until, about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, we swept round to the lee of an island, and floated into a baylet, still as a pond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>Our mop-headed guide and pilot grunted his terror, and sought every opportunity to escape the doom which we were hurrying to meet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>Another gale visited us at Usuguru, blowing as though from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>Its force seemed to compress the water; repelled by the weightier element, it brushed its face into <num value="1000000">millions</num> of tiny ripples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4567"/>A few days later, we coasted by the island of Wavuma.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4568"/><num value="5">Five</num> piratical craft came up, and we behaving, as we always did, in that lackadaisical, so fatally-encouraging manner, they became rude, insolent, and, finally, belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>Of course, it resulted in a violent rupture; there was an explosion, <num value="1">one</num> of their canoes sank, and then we had peace, and sailed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>We were on the <name>Equator</name> now. We cut across the <rs type="place">Napoleon Channel</rs>, through which the superfluous waters of the lake flow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>At the northern end they abruptly fall about <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure>, and then rush northward as the <rs>Victoria Nile</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>On the western side of the channel is Uganda, dominated by a prince, entitled Kabaka, or <rs type="role2">Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>He soon heard of the presence of my boat on the lake, and despatched a flotilla to meet me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/>In the stern of the boat was a white man gazing wistfully towards Uganda.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>The dream of the <rs>Imperial</rs> lady is no sooner told, than a breathless messenger appears at the palace gate and informs the astonished Court that he had seen a boat, with white wings like those of the fish-eagle, skimming along the shores, and at the after-end of the boat there was a white man, scrutinizing the land!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4579"/>Hence, the commodore of the flotilla, on meeting with me, uses words which astonish me by their courtly sound; and, following in the wake of the canoes, we sail towards Usavara, where, I am told, the <rs>Emperor</rs> of Uganda awaits me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4580"/>We see <num value="1000">thousands</num> of people arranging themselves in order, as we come in view of the immense camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/>The crews in the canoes fire volleys of musketry, which are answered by volleys from shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4582"/>Kettle and bass-drums thunder out a welcome, flags and banners are waved, and the people vent a great shout.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>He himself was probably the main cause of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>The facility with which he comprehended what was alluded to in conversation, the eagerness of his manner, the enthusiasm he displayed when the wonders of civilisation were broached to him, tempted me to introduce the subject of Christianity, and I delayed my departure from Uganda much longer than prudence counselled, to impress the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rudimentary lessons on his mind.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>But I must leave my friend <persName><foreName>Mtesa</foreName></persName>, and his wonderful court, and the imperial capital, Rubaga, for other scenes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/><measure n="10days" type="date">Ten days</measure> after we left the genial court, I came upon the scene of a tragedy, which was commented upon in Parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>We were coasting the eastern side of a large island, looking for a port where we could put in to purchase provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>We had already been <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure> without food, and though the people on the neighbouring main were churlish, I hoped the islanders would be more amenable to reason and kindly largesse of cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>Herds of cattle grazed on the summit and slopes of the island hills; plantations of bananas, here and there, indicated abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>As we rowed along the shore, a few figures emerged from the shades of the frondent groves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>They saw us rowing, and raised the war-cry in long-drawn, melodious notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>It drew numbers out of the villages; they were seen gathering from summit, hollow, and slope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>Besides the fierce shouting, their manner was not reassuring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>But hungry as we were, and not knowing whither to turn to obtain supplies, this manifest hostility we thought would moderate after a closer acquaintance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>We pulled gently round a point to a baylet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>The natives followed our movements, poising their spears, stringing their bows, picking out the best rocks for their slings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>Observing them persistent in hostile preparations, we ceased rowing about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> from the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>The interpreter with the mop head was requested to speak to the natives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>You can imagine how he pleaded, hunger inspiring his eloquence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>The poised spears were lowered, the ready rocks were dropped, and they invited us by signs with open palms to advance without fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>We were <num value="13">thirteen</num> souls, including myself; they between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="400">four hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>Prudence advised retreat, hunger impelled <pb id="p.314" n="314"/>us on; the islanders also invited us. Wisdom is a thing of exceedingly slow growth; had we been wise, we should have listened to the counsels of prudence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/> <quote>It is almost always the case, master,</quote> said Safeni, the coxswain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/><quote>These savages cry out and threaten, and talk big; but, you will see, these people will become fast friends with us. Besides, if we leave here without food, where shall we get any?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/></quote> At the same time, without waiting for orders, <num value="4">four</num> men nearest the bow dipped their oars into the water, and gently moved the boat nearer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>Seeing the boat advance, the natives urged us to be without fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>They smiled, entered the water up to their hips, held out inviting hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>They called us <quote>brothers,</quote> <quote>friends,</quote> <quote>good fellows.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>This conquered our reluctance; the crew shot the boat towards the natives; their hands closed on her firmly; they ran with her to the shore; as many as could lay hold assisted, and dragged her high and dry about <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure> from the lake.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>Then ensued a scene of rampant wildness and hideous ferocity of action beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/>When this outbreak first took place, I had sprung up to kill and be killed, a revolver in each hand; but, as I rose to my feet, the utter hopelessness of our situation was revealed to me &mdash; a couple of mitrailleuses only could have quenched their ferocious fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>We resigned ourselves to the tempest of shrieking rage with apparent indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>This demeanour was not without its effect; the delirious fury subsided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>Our interpreter spoke, our coxswain pleaded with excellent pantomime, and, with Kiganda words, explained; but the arrival of <num value="50">fifty</num> new-comers kindled anew the tumult; it increased to the perilous verge of murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>The coxswain was pushed headlong into the boat; <placeName reg="Kirango's head">Kirango's head</placeName> received a sounding thwack from a lance-staff; a club came down heartily on the back of my mop-headed guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>I grinned fiendishly, I fear, because they deserved it for urging me to such a hell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>I had presently to grin another way, for a gang paid their attentions to me. They mistook my hair for a wig, and attempted <pb id="p.315" n="315"/>to pull it off. They gave it a wrench until the scalp tingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>Unresisting, I submitted to their abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>But, though I was silent, I thought a great deal, and blessed them in my heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>After a little while they seized our oars &mdash; our legs, as they called them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>The boat would lie helpless in their power, they thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>The natives took position on a small eminence about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> away, to hold a palaver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4660"/>It was a slow affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4661"/>They lunched and drank wine.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>About noon, the boat was launched for her final work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>When we rowed across the river, the mere sight of her long oars, striking the water with uniform movement, alarmed the unsophisticated aborigines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>They yielded at last, and the double caravan was transported to the left bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>Nothing could be more pacific than the solitary boat gliding down on the face of the stream, without a movement of oar or paddle; but its appearance, nevertheless, was hailed by the weird war-cries of the <name>Wenya</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>We came to the confluence of the <name>Ruiki</name> with the <rs>Lualaba</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>I formed a camp at the point to await our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>On the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> the land-column appeared, weary, haggard, sick, and low-spirited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>Nevertheless, nothing was to be gained by a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>We were in search of friendly savages, if such could be found, where we might rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>But, as day after day passed on, we found the natives increasing rather than abating in wild rancour, and unreasonable hate of strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>At every curve and bend they <quote>telephoned</quote> along the river the warning signals; the forests on either bank flung hither and thither the strange echoes; their huge wooden drums sounded the muster for fierce resistance; reed arrows, tipped with poison, were shot at us from the jungle as we glided by. To add to our distress, the small-pox attacked the caravan, and old and young victims of the pest were flung daily into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>What a terrible land!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>Both banks, shrouded in tall, primeval forests, were filled with invisible, savage enemies; out of every bush glared eyes flaming with hate; in the stream lurked the crocodiles to feed upon the unfortunates; the air seemed impregnated with the seeds of death!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>On the <dateStruct value="-12-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, our miseries culminated in a grand effort of the savages to annihilate us. The cannibals had manned the topmost branches of the trees above the village of <placeName reg="Vinya Njara">Vinya Njara</placeName>; they lay like pards crouching amidst the garden-plants, or coiled like pythons in clumps of sugar-cane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>Maddened by wounds, we became deadly in our aim; the rifle <pb id="p.325" n="325"/>seldom failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>But, while we skirmished in the woods, the opposite bank of the river belched flotillas, which recalled us to the front, and the river-bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>For <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, with scarcely any rest, the desperate fighting lasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>Finally, Tippu-Tib appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>His men cleared the woods; and by night I led a party across the river, and <measure n="36" type="captured">captured thirty-six</measure> canoes belonging to those who had annoyed us on the right bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>Then peace was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>I purchased <num value="23">twenty-three</num> canoes, and surrendered the others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>Beyond <placeName reg="Vinya Njara">Vinya Njara</placeName>, the <name>Arabs</name> would not proceed, and I did not need them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>We were far enough from <placeName reg="Nyangwe">Nyangwe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>Its seductive life could no longer tempt my people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>Accordingly, we prepared to part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>I embarked my followers in the canoes and boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>Tippu-Tib ranged his people along the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>His Wanyamuezi chanted the mournful farewell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>We surrendered ourselves to the strong flood, which bore us along to whatever Fate reserved in store for us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>Dense woods covered both banks and islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>Though populous settlements met our eyes frequently, our intercourse with the aborigines was of a fitfully fierce character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>With an audacity sprung from ignorance, and cannibal greed, they attacked us with ever fresh relays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>A few weak villages allowed our flotilla to glide by unmolested, but the majority despatched their bravest warriors, who assailed us with blind fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>Important tributaries, such as the <name>Uruidi</name>, the <name>Loweva</name>, the <name>Leopold</name>, and the <name>Lufu</name>, opened wide gaps in the dark banks, and lazy creeks oozed from amid low flats and swamps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>Armies of parrots screamed overhead as they flew across the river; aquatic birds whirred by us to less disturbed districts; legions of monkeys sported in the branchy depths; howling baboons alarmed the solitudes; crocodiles haunted the sandy points and islets; herds of hippopotami grunted thunderously at our approach; elephants bathed their sides by the margin of the river; there was unceasing vibration from <num value="1000000">millions</num> of insects throughout the livelong day. The sky was an azure dome, out of which the sun shone large and warm; the river was calm, and broad, and brown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>While we floated past the wilderness, we were cheered by its calm and restful aspect, but the haunts of the wild men became positively hateful.

<p>Such were my experiences until I arrived at what is now known as the <rs type="place">Stanley Falls</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>The savages gathered about us on the river, and lined the shore to witness the catastrophe, but I faced the left bank, drove the natives away, and landed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>I myself was still in doubt as to what river-system it belonged to. But below the <rs type="place">Falls</rs>, the <rs>Lualaba</rs>, nearly a mile wide, curved northwest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>I had not much time to speculate, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>Every hour was replete with incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>The varied animal life on the shores, the effervescing face of the turbid flood, the subtle rising and sinking of the greedy crocodile, the rampant plunge and trumpet snort of the hippos, the unearthly, flesh-curdling cry of the relentless cannibal &mdash; had it not been for these, which gave tone to our life, there was every disposition to brood, and dream, and glide on insensibly to eternal forget-fulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>Looked I ahead, I viewed the stem river streaming away &mdash; far away into a tremulous, vaporous ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>But see!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>we have arrived at the confluence of the <rs>Lualaba</rs> with a river which rivals it in breadth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>Down the latter, a frantic host of feathered warriors urge a fleet of monstrous canoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>They lift their voices in a vengeful chorus, the dense <pb id="p.327" n="327"/>forest repeats it, until it flies pealing from bank to bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>The war-horns are blown with deafening blasts, the great drums boom out a sound which fills our ears and deafens our sense of hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>For a moment, we are aghast at the terrific view!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>The instinct of most of our party is to fly. Fly from that infuriate rush!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>Impossible! The rifles of our boat are directed against the fugitives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>They are bidden to return, to form a line, to drop anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>The shields which have been our booty from many a fight are lifted to bulwark the non-combatants, the women and the children; and every rifleman takes aim, waiting for the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>It is <quote>neck or nothing</quote> ! I have no time to pray, or take sentimental looks around, or to breathe a savage farewell to the savage world!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>There are <num value="54">fifty-four</num> canoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>The foremost is a Leviathan among native craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>It has <num value="80">eighty</num> paddlers, standing in <num value="2">two</num> rows, with spears poised for stabbing, their paddles knobbed with ivory, and the blades carved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>There are <num value="8">eight</num> steersmen at the stern, a group of prime young warriors at the bow, capering gleefully, with shield and spear; every arm is ringed with broad ivory bracelets, their heads gay with parrot-feathers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>The Leviathan bears down on us with racing speed, its consorts on either flank spurting up the water into foam, and shooting up jets with their sharp prows; a thrilling chant from <num value="2000">two thousand</num> throats rises louder and louder on our hearing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>Presently, the poised spears are launched, and a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> later my rifles respond with a ripping, crackling explosion, and the dark bodies of the canoes and paddlers rush past us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>They find there is death in those flaming tubes in the hands of the strangers, and, with possibly greater energy than they advanced, they retreat, the pursued becoming the pursuers in hot chase.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>My blood is up. It is a murderous world, and I have begun to hate the filthy, vulturous shoals who inhabit it. I pursue them up-stream, up to their villages; I skirmish in their streets, drive them pell-mell into the woods beyond, and level their ivory temples; with frantic haste I fire the huts, and end the scene by towing the canoes into mid-stream and setting them adrift!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/><pb id="p.328" n="328"/></p> 
<p>Now, suspecting everything with the semblance of man, like hard-pressed stags, wearied with fighting, our nerves had become unstrung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>We were still only in the middle of the continent, and yet we were being weeded out of existence, day by day, by twos and threes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>The hour of utter exhaustion was near, when we should lie down like lambs, and offer our throats to the cannibal butchers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>But relief and rest were near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>The last great affluent had expanded the breadth of the <rs>Lualaba</rs> to <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>I sheered off the mainland, entered these channels, and was shut out from view.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>But, every <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, the channels, flowing diagonally, floated us in view of the wild men of the mainland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>With drumming and horn-blowing, these ruthless people came on, ignoring the fact that their intended victims might hold their lives dear, might fight strenuously for their existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>The silly charms and absurd fetishes inspired the credulous natives with a belief in their invulnerability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>They advanced with a bearing which, by implication, I understood to mean, <quote>It is useless to struggle, you know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>Ha, ha; meat, meat, we shall have meat to-day!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>and they dashed forward with the blind fury of crocodiles in sight of their prey, and the ferocious valour of savages who believe themselves invincible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>Why, I answered them with the energy of despair, and tore through them with blazing rifles, leaving them wondering and lamenting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>I sought the mid-channel again, and wandered on with the current, flanked by untenanted islets, which were buried in tropical shade by clustered palms and the vivid leafage of paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>Ostracised by savage humanity, the wilds embraced us, and gave us peace and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>In the voiceless depths of the watery wilderness we encountered neither treachery nor guile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>Therefore we clung to them as long as we could, and floated down, down, hundreds of miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>Sometimes in crossing from <num value="1">one</num> to another there was an open view of water from side to side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5273"/>Others were equally impenetrable to reason and persuasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5274"/>Intuitively, I felt that Braconnier, though polite and agreeable, <pb id="p.347" n="347"/>was not to be entrusted with any practical work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>His education and character had utterly unfitted him for work of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>He was asked to superintend a little road-making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/>He sought a nice, shady place, and fell asleep; and his men, of course, while they admired him for his easy disposition, did what was most agreeable to them, and dawdled over their work, by which we lost <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>. When myself incapacitated by a sudden stroke of fever, I requested him to supervise the descent of the boiler-wagon down a hill; not <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> later the boiler and wagon were smashed, and he was brought to me, half-dead from his injuries!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>He was appointed chief of Leopoldville, but, in <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, the place resembled a ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/>Grass encroached everywhere, the houses were falling to pieces, the gardens choked with weeds, the steamers were lying corroding in the port, the natives were estranged, and he and his men were reduced to a state of siege.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5280"/>He allowed a young <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> lieutenant and <num value="6">six</num> Zanzibaris to enter a small unsuitable canoe and attempt to ascend the <rs>Congo</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5286"/>Another time he was sent with a man to transport a company of men over a river to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>After waiting an hour, I strode to the bank of the <pb id="p.348" n="348"/>river and found them paddling in opposite directions, each blaming the other for his stupidity, and, being in a passion of excitement, unable to hear the advice of the men across the river, who were bawling out to them how to manage their canoe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>Another man was so ludicrously stupid that he generally was saved from punishment because his mistakes were so absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/>We were <num value="1">one</num> day floating down the <rs>Congo</rs>, and, it being near camping time, I bade him, as he happened to be bowman on the occasion, to stand by and seize the grass on the bank to arrest the boat, when I should call out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>The boat's crew roared at the ridiculous sight; but, nevertheless, his stupidity cost the tired men a hard pull to ascend again, for not every place was available for a camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>He it was, also, who, on an occasion when we required the branch of a species of arbutus which overhung the river to be cut away, to allow the canoes to be brought nearer to the bank for safety, actually went astride of the branch, and chopped away until he fell into the water with the branch, and lost our axe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>Presently, having got beyond view of his station, the wind died away, and he was carried down by the mighty flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/>He began to cry out for aid, as he had forgotten his paddles; but his cries could not be heard, he was alone on the wide waters!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5305"/>Towards midnight, his men, getting anxious, set out in search of him, and, after many hours, found him nearly distracted with terror, and brought him to camp, vowing he would never again trust himself alone on the <rs>Congo</rs>!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>To add to our desperate state, several of our followers who had not sickened, lost heart, became mad with hunger and wild forebodings, tossed the baggage into the bush, and fled from us, as from a pest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/>He will never be so civilised as to be independent of his stomach; so it must be understood that we also exhibited our weakness during that trying period; but, supported by little trifles of food, more prudent in economizing it, subjected to less physical strain, we forced ourselves to preserve the austerity and dignity of superiors.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>The <orgName n="Foreign Office" type="office">Foreign Office</orgName> had furnished me with copies of all Emin's letters, and from their tone, character, and numbers of statements, I had formed, what probably every <num value="1">one</num> else had, an opinion of a <rs type="role" reg="Military-Governor">Military Governor</rs>, who, with <num value="2">two</num> steamers and steel boats, had been in the habit of visiting the various lake ports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>I asked again and again if a white man had been seen, and I received an answer always in the negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5443"/>I had left my steel boat at Ipoto, because of our depleted numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5444"/>No food was obtainable on the alkalised plains bordering the lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5445"/>The native canoes were only suitable for inshore fishing and calm weather; and there was not a tree visible out of which a sizeable canoe could be made!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>After consulting with the officers, I found that they also were surprised at the inexplicable absence of news of Emin, and a great many guesses wide of the truth, as it appeared later, were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>But no amount of guessing would feed <num value="200">two hundred</num> hungry men, stranded on a naked lake shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>I therefore resolved, after <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> halt, to retrace our steps to Ibwiri, and there erect a small fort for the protection of the ammunition, and as a resting-place for my sick; after which we could return once more to the lake, and, launching my boat on its waters, sail in search of the missing <rs>Pasha</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>Agreeably to this resolution, I turned my back on the lake on the <dateStruct value="1887-12-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1887</year>,</dateStruct> and, <measure n="21days" type="date">twenty-one days</measure> later, arrived at Ibwiri, the site of <placeName reg="Fort Bodo">Fort Bodo</placeName>.

<p><num value="1">One</num> day's distance from the lake I heard that there was a packet awaiting me at Kavalli, from a white man called by the natives <quote>Malleju,</quote> or the <quote>bearded man,</quote> who, of course, was Emin Pasha.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>Native rumour, according to Emin's letter, had stated that white men were at the south end of the lake, and he had embarked on <num value="1">one</num> of his steamers to ascertain if the report were true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5459"/>It was an extraordinary thing, that, after expecting us on the <dateStruct value="-12-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, he had required <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> to make up his mind to visit the south end of the lake!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>Unless we chose to wait inactively for Emin to pay Kavalli a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> visit, it was necessary to send the boat in search of him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>Towards sunset of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> day after his departure, those looking northward up the lake discovered a column of smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>As may be imagined, our people were almost beside themselves with delight, because the object of our strenuous quest was at last amongst them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>We agreed to pitch our camps side by side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>Emin and his guard of Soudanese to the right, and we to the left, on the edge of the lake.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5467"/>For several days we luxuriated in our well-earned rest and good cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>I was in a state of joyous ebullience; I acquiesced with all suggestions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/>Few men could have acted the part of hospitable and pleasant host so well as Emin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>I quite understood now how <persName n="Felkin,Doctor,,,," id="n0103.0021.00361.01172" reg="nearbymention:Felkin,R.,W.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Felkin</surname></persName> had appreciated this side of Emin's character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>He was cordial in manner, well-read, had seen much, and appeared to be most likeable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>Then also my anxieties respecting provisions for the people were at an end, for Emin had provided abundance of grain, and, as the main object of the expedition was now within view of being achieved, my feelings all round were those of unalloyed <pb id="p.362" n="362"/>pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>Many a time afterwards, I looked back upon this period as upon a delightful holiday.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>Until the <dateStruct value="-05-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, our respective camps were close together; and we daily met and chatted about various things, during which, naturally, the topic as to whether he would stay in Equatoria, or accompany me to the coast, came up for discussion frequently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5475"/>But, from the beginning to the end of our meetings, I was only conscious that I was profoundly ignorant of his intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5476"/>On some days, after a friendly dinner the night previous, he held out hopes that he might accompany me; but the day following he would say, <quote>No, if my people go, I go; if they stay, I stay.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>For <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> I assented to this; but it became impressed on my mind, that he had a personal objection to going to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, from a fear that he might be shelved, and his life would become wasted in a Cairene or Stamboul coffee-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>The ideal Governor whom I had imagined, had been altogether replaced by a man who had other views than those of his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5479"/>What those views were, I could never gather definitely, for, as has been observed, the impression of <num value="1">one</num> day was displaced by that of the next; and his real opinions, upon any topic save an abstract question, were too transient to base a conclusion upon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5480"/>Altogether, I spent <measure n="25days" type="date">twenty-five days</measure> with Emin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5481"/>I then retraced my steps to <placeName reg="Fort Bodo">Fort Bodo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5482"/>After carefully provisioning <num value="107">one hundred and seven</num> men, and serving out <measure n="25days" type="date">twenty-five days</measure> rations to each man, I commenced the search for the <name>Rear</name>-Column on the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5483"/>I have often been asked how I dared to face that terrible and hungry Forest alone, after such awful experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5484"/>If I suggested admonitions of duty and conscience as being sufficient motives, I seldom failed to notice a furtive shrug.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5485"/>But, really, I fail to see what else could have been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5486"/>The Rear-Column was as much a part of the expedition as the <rs>Advance</rs>, and had there been only <num value="20">twenty</num> blacks, it would have been as much my duty to seek them as to find what had become of <num value="260">two hundred and sixty</num> Zanzibaris, with <num value="5">five</num> white officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5487"/>As for sending any of my own officers to perform such an important mission, well, there is a saying which I believe in thoroughly, <quote>If you want a thing <hi rend="italics">done</hi>, you must do it yourself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5488"/>Besides these motives, I was too nervously anxious about the <pb id="p.363" n="363"/>long-absent Column, which had been instructed to follow us, and the suspense was intolerable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5489"/>It was also, principally, this nervous anxiety about these missing people that drove me through the <name>Great Forest</name> at such a rate, that what had taken us <measure n="129days" type="date">one hundred and twenty-nine days</measure> was now performed in <measure n="62days" type="date">sixty-two days</measure>. On <dateStruct value="1888-08-17"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="17">17</day>, <year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct>, the <num value="83" type="ordinal">eighty-third</num> day since quitting the <name>Pasha</name>, on <placeName key="possibilities=12" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Lake Albert</placeName>, I came in view of the village of <placeName reg="Banalya">Banalya</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="90miles">ninety miles</distance> <offset>east</offset> of  <placeName key="tgn,1089577" n="1.000 10" reg="Yambuya,Orientale,Congo,Africa">Yambuya</placeName></placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5657"/>However benevolent and considerate Emin's English friends may have been disposed to be towards him, they were not above being affronted at their kind offices being rejected so churlishly, and from the offended tone which the <name>Press</name> now assumed, may be gathered the nature of my own feelings when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became acquainted with his uncertain disposition, and <pb id="p.374" n="374"/>his capricious and eccentric nature.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5678"/>It is hardly yet time for me to express the sorrow I truly feel at the pain these inevitable disclosures have brought upon men and women innocent of any fault; but no <num value="1">one</num> is likely to question the earnestness of my regret at a result so directly counter to the wishes close to my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5679"/>As it is, this is an opportunity given to competing nations to cast a slur upon <name>British</name> enterprise in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5680"/>Beyond and above any personal question whatever stands the honour of the <rs>English</rs> name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5681"/>I wish, therefore, to say, with whatever weight my long experience may give my words, that I believe that conduct such as that above alluded to is entirely unusual and exceptional among Englishmen engaged in pioneering work in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5682"/>I believe no nation has surpassed the <rs>English</rs> in tone, temper, and principle, in dealing with the <name>Negro</name> races; on the other hand, there have been many <name>English</name> explorers, from my revered master, <persName n="Livingstone,,David,,," id="n0103.0021.00376.01220" reg="default:Livingstone,David,,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>, down to my own comrades in the <orgName type="mil" key="AdvanceGuard">Advance Guard</orgName> of this last expedition, who have united, in quite a singular degree, gentleness with valour.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5683"/>For myself, I lay no claim to any exceptional fineness of nature; but I say, beginning life as a rough, ill-educated, impatient man, I have found my schooling in these very <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> experiences which are now said by some to be in themselves detrimental to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5684"/>I have learnt by actual stress of imminent danger, in the first place, that self-control is more indispensable than gunpowder, and, in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <pb id="p.377" n="377"/>place, that persistent self-control under the provocation of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> travel is impossible without real, heartfelt sympathy for the natives with whom <num value="1">one</num> has to deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5685"/>If <num value="1">one</num> regards these natives as mere brutes, then the annoyances that their follies and vices inflict are indeed intolerable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>In order to rule them, and to keep <num value="1">one</num>'s life amongst them, it is needful resolutely to regard them as children, who require, indeed, different methods of rule from English or <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName> citizens, but who must be ruled in precisely the same spirit, with the same absence of caprice and anger, the same essential respect to our fellow-men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>In proof of the fact that <name>British</name> explorers, as a whole, have learnt these lessons, I would point simply to the actual state of <name>British</name> influence in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5699"/>I had looked at the whole expedition more as a matter of exploration than anything else, and thought that scant justice had been done you. Now, I regard what you accomplished as an heroic feat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5700"/>Let me put it to you from my point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in pursuit of a great object, had, through the proper authorities, sent an officer to rule a great province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>He was accompanied by an Egyptian force, acting under his orders, that is, under those of <name>British</name> authorities; and the forces and civil officers were accompanied by wives, children, servants, and followers of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>They formed an offshoot from <placeName reg="Khartoum, Khartoum, As-Sudan" key="tgn,7001619">Khartoum</placeName>, but very remote from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>Disturbances arose in the country, <placeName reg="Khartoum, Khartoum, As-Sudan" key="tgn,7001619">Khartoum</placeName> and its dependencies were cut off from intercourse with the external world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> determined to rescue her officers, and undertook to do so by the only route used by civilised man, that is, by the line of communication which led from the northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5706"/>She failed; <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0103.0021.00378.01228" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Charles,George,,:1"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> fell; the attempt was abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5707"/>Emin Pasha, his provinces, his forces, his civil servants, and adherents, with all their women and children, were abandoned to their fate; but held out. Emin Pasha naturally strove to communicate with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, imploring to be extricated from his difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5708"/>His strong appeals roused sympathy, and shame at his abandonment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5709"/>It was determined to rescue him. How was this to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5710"/>The only route by which this could be done was by reaching him from the southward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5711"/>But what a task was this &mdash; an almost hopeless <num value="1">one</num>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5712"/>What a journey from the <rs type="place">East Coast</rs>, or <placeName reg="West Coast, South Island, New Zealand" key="tgn,7016850">West Coast</placeName>, before <num value="1">one</num> could turn northward and reach him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5714"/>What wilds and forests to traverse!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5715"/>What barbarous tribes to confront!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5716"/>By what means were the requisite arms, ammunition, and supplies, to be carried, which would enable Emin to continue to hold his own, if he chose to remain; or enable you all to force, if necessary, your way to some port where you could embark?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5717"/>Undaunted by these evident difficulties, you undertook this task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5718"/>After truly severe exertions, you reach him. He joins you, emerges from his difficulties with all his followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5719"/>You have saved, at great sacrifices, portions of the arms and ammunition on which the safety of all depends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5720"/>You now find that nearly a <num value="1000">thousand</num> human beings, <pb id="p.379" n="379"/>men, women, and children, are committed to your care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5721"/>These you are to conduct by a long perilous route to a port, where they embark for <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5722"/>The whole native population along a great part of the route is hostile, or alarmed at this great body of armed men and their families invading their territories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5723"/>They can little understand that they are returning to their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5724"/>If so, why do they not return by the same way by which they left them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5725"/>Naturally they view with suspicion and alarm this worn, diseased multitude, which they are often ill able to supply with sufficient food to save them from starvation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5726"/>Yet this body of human beings you have to supply with rations, with arms, with medicines; without horses or carriages of any kind, the sick and wounded had to be moved; little children and famishing mothers had to be got along somehow; through long and exhausting marches, water had to be found, wild beasts kept off, who, notwithstanding all precautions, carried off several little ones in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5727"/>You had quarrels and animosities to compose, discipline to preserve amongst men of various races and languages, and a multitude of other cases to meet; yet you were in ill health yourself, worn by great toils in previous years, and in an unhealthy climate, which rendered men fretful, sullen, and careless of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5728"/>Nevertheless, you accomplished your task, and led your people &mdash; but a residue of them, indeed &mdash; to a port of safety, without reward and without promotion, or recognition from your country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5729"/>I have thought over all history, but I cannot call to mind a greater task than you have performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>It is not an exploration, alone, you have accomplished; it is also a great military movement, by which those who were in the <rs>British</rs> service were rescued from a position of great peril.</p>

<p>For <num value="1">one</num> so young, Stairs's abilities and sterling sense were remarkable; and, in military pliancy at the word of command, he was a born soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5750"/>This is a merit which is inestimable in a tropical country, where duty has to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5751"/>A leader in a climate like that of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, cannot sugar-coat his orders, and a certain directness of speech must be expected; under such fretting conditions as we were in, it was a source of joy to feel that in Stairs I had a man, who, when a thing had to be done, could face about, and proceed to do it, as effectively as I could do it in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5752"/>In the way of duty he was without reproach.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5754"/>With his unsophisticated simplicity, and amusing naivete, it was impossible to bear a grudge against him. Outside of his profession, he was not so experienced as Stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>When placed in charge of a company, his muster-book soon fell into confusion; but by the erasures, and re-arrangements, it was evident that he did his best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>Such men may blunder over and over again, and receive absolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5757"/>He possessed a fund of genuine wit and humour; and the innocent pleasure he showed when he brought smiles to our faces, endeared him to me. This childlike naivete, which distinguished him in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, as in <orgName n="London Society" type="society">London society</orgName>, had a great deal to do with the affectionateness with which everyone regarded him. But he was super-excellent among the sick and suffering; then his every action became precise, firm, and masterful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/>There was no shade of doubt on his face, not a quiver of his nerves; his eyes grew luminous with his concentrated mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>Few people at home know what an African ulcer is like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>It grows as large as the biggest mushroom; it destroys the flesh, discloses the arteries and sinews, and having penetrated to the bone, consumes it, and then eats its way round the limb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5761"/>The sight is awful, the stench is horrible; yet <persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0103.0021.00381.01245" reg="mostcommon:Parke,nomatch:0"><surname>Parke</surname></persName> washed and dressed from <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="50">fifty</num> of such hideous sores daily, and never winced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5762"/>The young man's heart was of pure gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5763"/>At such times, I could take off my cap, out of pure reverence to his heroism, skill, and enduring patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5764"/>When Stairs was <pb id="p.382" n="382"/>wounded with a poisoned arrow, he deliberately sucked it, though, had the poison been fresh, it might have been a highly dangerous proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5765"/>All the whites passed through his hands; and, if they do not owe their lives to him, they owed him a great debt of gratitude for relief, ease, and encouragement, as well as incomparable nursing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5766"/>Personally, I was twice attacked by gastritis, and how he managed to create out of nothing, as it were, palatable food for an inflamed stomach, for such prolonged periods, and to maintain his tenderness of interest in his fractious patient, was a constant marvel to me. When consciousness returned to me, out of many delirious fits, his presence seemed to lighten that sense of approaching calamity that often pressed on me. Could the wounded and sick Zanzibaris have spoken their opinion of him, they would have said, <quote>He was not a man, but an angel </quote> ; for the attributes he showed to the suffering were so unusually noble and exquisitely tender, that poor, wayward human nature wore, for once, a divine aspect to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5767"/>And <persName n="Jephson,,,,," id="n0103.0021.00382.01246" reg="mostcommon:Jephson,Mounteney,,,:3"><surname>Jephson</surname></persName>, so honourable, and high-minded: though of a vehement character at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of his intelligence and heart is not long in adapting himself to circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5768"/>He developed quickly, taking the rough work of a pioneer with the indifference of a veteran.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5769"/>He was endowed with a greater stock of physical energy than any of the others, and exhibited most remarkable endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5770"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I feared that he was inclined to be too rough on his company; but this was before he mastered the colloquial expressions, which, with old travellers, serve the same purpose as the stick.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5771"/>When a young Englishman, replete with animal vigour, and braced for serious work, has to lead a <num value="100">hundred</num> or so raw natives, who cannot understand a word he says, a good deal of ungentle hustling must be expected; but, as soon as he is able to express himself in the vernacular, both commander and natives soon lose that morbid fault-finding to which they were formerly disposed, and the stick becomes a mere badge of authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>Chaff, or a little mild malice, spiced with humour, is often more powerful than the rod with Africans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>By the time we issued from the forest, <persName n="Jephson,,,,," id="n0103.0021.00382.01247" reg="mostcommon:Jephson,Mounteney,,,:3"><surname>Jephson</surname></persName> had become a most valuable officer, with his strong, brave, and resolute nature, capable for any work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>Not even a saint is proof against a congested liver, and a miserable diet of horse-food and animal provender; and, yet, during their severe experiences of the <rs>Forest</rs>, the officers were in better temper than when, ascending the <rs>Congo</rs>, they enjoyed regular meals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>The toughest human patience may be stretched to breaking when fever is rioting in the veins, when the head is filled with hot blood, and the poor victim of malaria is ready to sink with his burden of responsibilities, when black servants take advantage of their master's helplessness, and a thoughtless companion chooses that inopportune moment to air his grievances, or provoke a discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>When <num value="1">one</num> is recovering from a fever, his senses racked, his ears in a tumult with quinine, his loins aching with inflamed vitals, it is too much to expect a sufferer, at this stage, to smile like a full-fed dreamer at home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/><num value="1">One</num> of my precautions against these intermittent periods of gloom and bitterness, when the temper is tindery, was to mess separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>Years ago, the unwisdom of being too much together had been forcibly impressed on me; I discovered that my remarks formed too much <quote>copy </quote> for note-books, and that my friends were in the habit of indiscriminately setting down every word, too often in a perverted sense, and continually taking snap-shots at me, without the usual formula of the <pb id="p.384" n="384"/>photographer, <quote> Look pleasant, please!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>On the <rs>Congo</rs>, it is too hot to stand on an open-air pedestal for long!

Then, upon the strength of table acquaintance, I found that the young men were apt to become overweening, familiar, and oblivious of etiquette and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>From that date, I took to living alone, by which my judgement of my subordinates was in no danger of being biassed by their convivial discourse; and I was preserved from the contempt which too often proceeds from familiarity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/>No doubt, I was debarred by this isolation from much that was entertaining and innocent, as well as deprived of that instruction, which simple youngsters of the jolly, and silly, age are prone to impart to their seniors; but that was my loss, not theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/>On the other hand, my opinions of them were not likely to be tinctured by malicious gossip, which is generally outspoken at a <rs n="dining table" type="product">dining-table</rs>, or in a camp; and I certainly discountenanced grumblers and cavillers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>On an African expedition, there often arises a necessity for sudden orders, which must be followed by prompt obedience, and the stern voice and peremptory manner at such times are apt to jar on the nerves of a subaltern, whose jokes were lately received with laughter, unless he be <num value="1">one</num> whose temper is controlled by his judgement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>All that he knows is his mother-tongue, and the art of reading, writing, and criticising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, he finds himself face to face with a new people, of different manners and customs, with whom he cannot exchange a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>He can do nothing for himself; there is no service that he can do with his arms; he cannot even cook his food, or set up his tent, or carry his bed. He has to depend on the black men for everything; but if he has a patient temper and self-control, he can take instruction from those who know the natives, and in many little ways he can make himself useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>If he is faultfinding, proud, and touchy, it will be months before he is worth his salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>In these early days he must undeceive himself as to his merits, and learn that, if he is humoured and petted more <pb id="p.385" n="385"/>than the blacks, it is not because of his white skin, but because of his childish helplessness, and in the hope that when his <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> apprenticehip is over, he will begin to show that his keep was to some purpose.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/>It took the officers some months to learn that, when they stood at the head of their companies, and <orgName type="company" n="Company I">I</orgName> repeated for the benefit of the natives in their own language the orders already given to them in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0103.0021.00385.01250" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, I was not speaking about themselves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5803"/>By and by, as they picked up a word or <num value="2">two</num> of the native language, they became less suspicious, and were able to distinguish between directness of speech and an affront.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>I, of course, knew that their followers, whom they had regarded as merely <quote>naked niggers,</quote> were faithful, willing, hard-working creatures, who only wanted fair treatment and good food to make them loveable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>At this early period my officers were possessed with the notion that my manner was <quote> hard,</quote> because I had not many compliments for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>That is a kind of pap which we may offer women and boys, but it is not necessary for soldiers and men, unless it is deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5807"/>It is true that, in the <rs>Forest</rs>, their demeanour was heroic; but I preferred to wait until we were out of it, before telling them my opinion, just as wages are paid after the work is finished, and an epitaph is best written at the close of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/>Besides, I thought they were superior natures, and required none of that encouragement, which the more childish blacks almost daily received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>In thinking of my own conduct I am at a disadvantage, <pb id="p.386" n="386"/>as there is no likelihood that I should appear to others as I appeared to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>I may have been in the habit of giving unmeasured offence each day by my exclusiveness; but I was simply carrying out what <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> experience had taught me was best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/>My companions had more to learn from me than I had to learn from them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5812"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> they messed together; but during the latter half of the journey, they also lived apart, experience having taught them the same lesson as I had learned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>To some, my solitary life might present a cheerless aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/>But it was not so in reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>The physical exercise of the day induced a pleasant sense of fatigue, and my endless occupations were too absorbing and interesting to allow room for baser thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>There was a strange poverty about our existence, which could not well be matched anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>The climate gave warmth, and so we needed no fuel save for cooking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>Our clothing could only be called presentable among naked people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5819"/>There was water in abundance and to spare, but soap was priceless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>Our food consisted of maize meal and bananas, but an English beggar would have disdained to touch it. Our salt was nothing better than pulverised mud.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5821"/>I was not likely to suffer from colds, catarrh, and pneumonia; but the ague with its differing intensities was always with me. My bedding consisted of a rubber sheet and rug over a pile of leaves or grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>I possessed certain rights of manhood, but only so long as I had the nerve to cause them to be respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5823"/>My literature was limited to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0103.0021.00386.01251" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, and a few choice authors, but my mind was not wrung by envy, scandal, disparagement, and unfairness; and my own thoughts and hopes were a perpetual solace.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>It is difficult for anyone who has not undergone experiences similar to ours to understand the amount of self-control each had to exercise, for <measure n="15hours" type="date">fifteen hours</measure> every day, amid such surroundings as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5825"/>The contest between human dispositions, tempers, prejudices, habits, natures, and the necessity for self-command, were very disturbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5826"/>The extremest forms of repulsiveness were around us, and dogged us day by day; the everlasting shade was a continued sermon upon decay and mortality; it reeked with the effluvia as of a grave; insects pursued our every movement, with their worries of stings and <pb id="p.387" n="387"/>bites, which frequently ended, because of our anemic condition, in pimples, sores, and ulcers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5828"/>It would be impossible within a limited space to enumerate the annoyances caused by the presence of hundreds of diseased individuals with whom we travelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5829"/>Something or other ailed them by scores, daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5830"/>Animate and inanimate nature seemed arrayed against us, to test our qualities to the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>For my protection against despair and madness, I had to resort to self-forgetfulness; to the interest which my task brought; to the content which I felt that every ounce of energy, and every atom of self had been already given to my duty, and that, no matter what followed, nothing more could be extracted from me. I had my reward in knowing that my comrades were all the time conscious that I did my best, and that I was bound to them by a common sympathy and aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>This encouraged me to give myself up to all neighbourly offices, and was morally fortifying.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>The anxieties of providing for the morrow lay heavy on me; for, in the savagest part of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, which, unknown to us, had been devasted by Manyuema hordes, we were not sure of being able to obtain anything that was eatable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5834"/>Then again, the follies and imprudences of my black men were a constant source of anxiety to me, for raw levies of black men are not wiser than raw levies of white men; it requires a calamity to teach both how to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5835"/>Not a day passed but the people received instruction, but in an hour it was forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/>If all had been prudent with their food, we should not have suffered so heavily; but the mutinous hunger of the moment obliterated every thought of the morrow's wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>How extremely foolish men can be, was exemplified by the series of losses attending <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> of camp-life at <placeName key="tgn,1089577" n="1.000 10" reg="Yambuya,Orientale,Congo,Africa">Yambuya</placeName>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5839"/>The Column consisted of picked men, sound in health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5840"/>In a month, however, many had been crippled by skewers in the path, placed there by the aborigines; these perforated their naked feet, some suffering from abrasions, or accidental cuts; others had their feet gashed by the sharp edges <pb id="p.388" n="388"/>of oyster-shells as they waded through the creeks; the effect of rain, dew, damp, fatigue, and scant food, all combined to impoverish the blood and render them more liable to disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5841"/>The negligence and heedlessness of some of the men was astonishing: they lost their equipment, rifles, tools, and clothing, as though they were so many somnambulists, and not accountable beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5842"/>The officers were unceasing in their exertions, but it would have required an officer for every <num value="10">ten</num> men, and each officer well-fed and in perfect health, to have overseered them properly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5843"/>The history of the journey proves what stratagems and arts we resorted to each day to check the frightful demoralisation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5844"/>It was in the aid and assistance given to me at this trying period that my officers so greatly distinguished themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5845"/>I have frequently been asked as to whether I never despaired during the time when the men were dropping away so fast, and death by starvation seemed so imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5846"/>No, I did not despair; but, as I was not wholly free from morbid thoughts, I may be said to have been on the edge of it, for quite <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>. <quote>How will all this end?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5847"/>was a question that I was compelled to ask myself over and over again; and then my mind would speculate upon our slim chances, and proceed to trace elaborately the process of ruin and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5848"/><quote>So many have died to-day, it will be the turn of a few more to-morrow, and a few others the next day, and so on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5849"/>Then the white men, no longer supplied by the share of their pickings, which the brave fellows laid at their tent-doors, must begin the quest of food for themselves; and each will ask, as he picks a berry here and a mushroom there, how it will all end, and when.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5850"/>And while he repeats this dumb self-questioning, little side-shows of familiar scenes will be glanced at. <num value="1">One</num> moment, a friend's face, pink and contented, will loom before him; or a well-known house, or a street astir with busy life, or a church with its congregation, or a theatre and its bright-faced audience; a tea-table will be remembered, or a drawing-room animate with beauty and happiness,--at least <pb id="p.389" n="389"/>something, out of the full life beyond the distant sea. After a while, exhausted nature will compel him to seek a leafy alcove where he may rest, and where many a vision will come to him of things that have been, until a profound darkness will settle on his senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5851"/>Before he is cold, a <quote>scout</quote> will come, then <num value="2">two</num>, then a score, and, finally, myriads of fierce yellow-bodied scavengers, their heads clad in shining horn-mail; and, in a few days, there will only remain a flat layer of rags, at <num value="1">one</num> end of which will be a glistening, white skull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5852"/>Upon this will fall leaves and twigs, and a rain of powder from the bores in the red wood above, and the tornado will wrench a branch down and shower more leaves, and the gusty blasts will sweep fine humus over it, and there that curious compost begun of the earthly in me will lie to all eternity!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5853"/>As I thought of this end, the chief feeling, I think, was <num value="1">one</num> of pity that so much unselfish effort should finish in a heap of nothingness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5854"/>I should not venture to say that my comrades shared in such thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5855"/>I could see that they were anxious, and that they would prefer a good loaf of bread to the best sermon; but their faces betrayed no melancholy gravity such as follows morbid speculations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5856"/>Probably, the <num value="4">four</num> brave young hearts together managed to be more cheerful than I, who was solitary; and thus they were able to cheat their minds out of any disposition to brood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5857"/>While, however, <num value="1">one</num> part of my nature dwelt upon stern possibilities, and analysed with painful minuteness the sensations of those who daily perished from hunger, another part of me was excessively defiant, active in invention, fertile in expedients, to extricate the expedition from its impending fate, and was often, for no known reason, exhilarant with prescience of ultimate triumph.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5859"/>The darkest night, however, is followed by dawn; and, by dint of pressing on, we emerged once more, after <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> of awful trials, into a land of plenty; but before we could say a <pb id="p.390" n="390"/>final farewell to those Equatorial woods much more had to be endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5888"/>I turn to a magnificently proportioned volume, bearing the date of <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, when <persName n="Rowlands,,John,,," id="n0103.0022.00392.01265" reg="default:Rowlands,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Rowlands</surname></persName> was a boy at school at <placeName key="tgn,7008548" n="1.000 1" reg="denbigh,denbighshire,wales,united kingdom,europe">Denbigh</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5889"/>In this atlas, the <rs>African Continent</rs> is exhibited, for about <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of its area, as a mighty blank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5890"/>The coast is well-defined, and the northern part, as far as <num value="10">ten</num> degrees from the <name>Equator</name>, is pretty freely sprinkled with familiar names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5891"/>We have <placeName reg="Lake Tchad">Lake Tchad</placeName>, Bornu, Darfur, Wadi-el-Bagharmi, Sennaar, Kordofan, and Khartum, and so on. But at the southern line of <quote>the <name>Soudan</name>, or Nigritia,</quote> knowledge suddenly ceases; and we enter upon the void that extends, right through and across <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, down to the <rs>Tropic</rs> of Capricorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5892"/><quote>Unexplored</quote> is printed, in bold letters, that stride over <measure n="1500miles" type="distance">fifteen hundred miles</measure> of country, from the tropical circle to well beyond the <name>Equator</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5893"/>The great lakes are marked only by a vague blob, somewhere in the interior, west of the <rs type="place">Zanzibar territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5894"/>The estuary of the <quote><placeName reg="Congo, Africa, " key="tgn,7017971">Congo</placeName>, or Zaire</quote> is shown, and a few miles of the river inland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5895"/>After that we are directed, by uncertain dots, along the supposed course of the stream northward, to where it is imagined to take its rise in the <rs>Montes Lunae</rs>, for which the map-maker can do no better for us than to refer, in brackets, to <quote><persName><foreName>Ptolemy</foreName></persName></quote> and <quote>Abulfeda Edrisi.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5896"/>I pass to another atlas, dated <dateStruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5897"/>Here there is considerable progress, especially as regards the eastern side of the <name>Continent</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5898"/>The <rs>White Nile</rs> and the Bahr-el-Ghazal have been traced almost to their sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5899"/>The <rs>Zambesi</rs> is known, and the <rs type="place">Victoria Falls</rs> are marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5900"/>Lakes <placeName reg="Victoria Nyanza lake">Victoria Nyanza</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nyassa lake">Nyassa</placeName> appear with solid boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5901"/>Tanganyika, however, is still uncertain, the <rs>Albert Nyanza</rs> with its broken lines testifies to the doubts of the geographer, and the <rs>Albert Edward</rs> does not appear at all; and beyond the line of the lakes, and north of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> degree of south latitude, <pb id="p.393" n="393"/>the blank of the interior is still as conspicuous, and almost as unrelieved, as it was <num value="2">two</num>-and-<measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> earlier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5902"/>By <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct>, there is a great change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5903"/>The name of <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00393.01266" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Henry,Morton,,:27"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> has begun to be written indelibly upon the surface of the <name>Continent</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5904"/>The vague truncated <quote><placeName reg="Congo, Africa, " key="tgn,7017971">Congo</placeName>, or Zaire</quote> is the <quote><placeName reg="Livingstone River">Livingstone River</placeName>,</quote> flowing in its bold horseshoe through the heart of the formerly unexplored region, with <quote><placeName reg="Stanley Falls,Orientale,Congo,Africa" key="tgn,1135702">Stanley Falls</placeName></quote> just before the river takes its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great spring westward, and <quote><persName n="Pool,,Stanley,,," id="n0103.0022.00393.01267" reg="default:Pool,Stanley,,,"><foreName>Stanley</foreName> <surname>Pool</surname></persName></quote> a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> lower down, where, after a long southerly course, the mighty stream makes its final plunge to the sea. Tributary rivers, hills, lakes, villages, tribal appellations, dot the waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5905"/>Uganda is marked, and Urua, and Unyanyembe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5906"/>If we pass on to the present day, and look at any good recent map, the desert seems to have become &mdash; as, indeed, it is &mdash; quite populous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5907"/>There is no stretch of unknown, and apparently unoccupied land, except in the <name>Sahara</name>, and between Somaliland and the <rs>White Nile</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5908"/>All the rest is neatly divided off, and most of it tinted with appropriate national colours; the <rs>British</rs>, red; the <rs>French</rs>, purple; the <name>German</name>, brown; the <name>Portuguese</name>, green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5909"/>In the map I am looking at there is, right in the middle, a big irregular square or polygon, which is painted yellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5910"/>It is <measure n="1200miles" type="distance">twelve hundred miles</measure> from north to south, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> from east to west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5911"/>It is scored by the winding black lines of rivers,--not the <rs>Congo</rs> only, but the <name>Aruwimi</name>, the <rs>Lualaba</rs>, the <name>Sankalla</name>, the <name>Ubangi</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5912"/>It is the <rs>Congo Free State</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the recognised political units of the world, with its area of <num value="800000">800,000</num> square miles, and its population computed at <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5913"/>The great hollow spaces have been filled in. The Dark Continent is, geographically at any rate, dark no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5914"/>The secret of the centuries has been solved!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5915"/>Geographical science has still its unfulfilled tasks to finish; but there can never again be another <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00393.01268" reg="mostcommon:Stanley,Henry,Morton,,:27"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5916"/>He is the last of the discoverers, unless, indeed, we shall have to reserve the title for his friend and younger disciple, Sven Hedin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5917"/>No other man, until the records of our civilisation perish, can lay bare a vast unknown tract of the earth's surface, for none such is left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5918"/>The North Pole and the <name>South Pole</name>, it is true, are still inviolate; but we know enough to be aware how little those regions can offer to the brave adventurers who strive to pierce their mysteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5919"/>There is no Polar continent, nor open <placeName reg="Antarctic Sea">Antarctic Sea</placeName>, only a dreary waste of lifeless ice, and unchanging snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5920"/>But the habitable and inhabited globe is mapped and charted; and none of the explorers, who laboured at the work during the past <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, did so much towards the consummation as <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00393.01269" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>Many others helped to fill in the blank in the atlas of <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, which has become the network of names in the atlas of <dateStruct value="1904--"><year reg="1904">1904</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5924"/>Their discoveries were made often with a more slender equipment and scantier resources; as administrators, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> at least could be counted his equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5925"/>But those of the distinguished band, who still survive, would freely acknowledge that it was <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01286" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> who put the crown and coping-stone on the edifice of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> exploration, and so completed the task, begun <measure n="24centuries" type="date">twenty-four centuries</measure> ago with the voyage of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Necho</foreName></persName>'s Phoeenician captains, and the <name>Periplus</name> of <persName n="Hanno,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01287" reg="mostcommon:Hanno,nomatch:0"><surname>Hanno</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5927"/>He linked the results of <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01289" reg="nearbymention:Livingstone,David,,,"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName>'s explorations with those of <persName n="Speke,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01290" reg="nearbymention:Speke,John,,,"><surname>Speke</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01291" reg="mostcommon:Grant,J.,A.,,:3"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Burton,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01292" reg="mostcommon:Burton,Richard,F.,,:2"><surname>Burton</surname></persName>, and so enabled the great lacustrine and riverine system of Equatorial <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 12" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> to become intelligible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>Without him, the work of his most illustrious predecessors might still have remained only a collection of splendid fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5932"/>The missionary traveller was steadily convinced that the <rs>Nile</rs> took its rise in <placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName>; or, rather, that it passed right through that inland sea. <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01296" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>, when he had found the <rs>Doctor</rs>, and restored the weary old man's spirit and confidence, induced him to join in an exploration trip round the north end of Tanganyika, which proved that there was no river flowing out of the lake, and therefore that no connection was possible with the <rs>Nile</rs> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>But <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01297" reg="nearbymention:Livingstone,David,,,"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> still believed that he was on the track of the great <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>He persisted in regarding his <placeName key="tgn,1126412" n="1.000 10" reg="Lualaba,Congo,Africa">Lualaba</placeName> as <num value="1">one</num> of the feeders of the <rs>Nile</rs>, and he was in search of the <num value="3">three</num> fountains of <persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00394.01298" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName>, in the neighbourhood of <placeName reg="Lake Bangweolo">Lake Bangweolo</placeName>, when he made his last journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5938"/>Before that, he does not seem to have been especially captivated by the geographical and scientific side of travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5939"/>He liked visiting strange countries, because he was a shrewd observer, with <pb id="p.395" n="395"/>a lively journalistic style, which could be profitably employed in describing people and places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>But the finding of <persName n="Livingstone,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00395.01302" reg="nearbymention:Livingstone,David,,,"><surname>Livingstone</surname></persName> made <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00395.01303" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> an explorer; and his own nature made him, in a sense, a missionary, though not quite of the <rs>Livingstone</rs> kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5941"/>He was a man who was happiest when he had a mission to accomplish, some great work entrusted to him which had to be got through, despite of difficulties and dangers; and when the famous traveller laid down his tired bones in the wilderness, <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00395.01304" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName> felt that it was decreed for him to carry on the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5954"/>His place is among those who have set the landmarks of nations and moulded their destinies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5955"/>When you conversed with him, at least in his later years, you <pb id="p.396" n="396"/>easily discovered that he had a firm grasp of the general sequence of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tambacounda, Senegal, Africa" key="tgn,1001742">Oriental</placeName> history, and a considerable insight into modern ethnological and archaeological learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5956"/>He had formed independent and original ideas of his own on these subjects; and when he talked, as he sometimes would, of the <name>Sabaeans</name> and the <name>Phoenicians</name>, and the early Arab voyagers, you saw that, to the rapid observation of the man of action, he had added much of the systematising and deductive faculty of the scholar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5957"/>He possessed the instinct of arrangement, which is the foundation of all true scholarship, and perhaps of all great practical achievement as well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5958"/>His intellectual power was, I think, seldom appreciated at its true value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5959"/>Its full measure is not given in his books, in spite of their vigorous style, their dramatic method of narration, and their brilliant pictorial passages; but nearly everything he wrote was in the nature of rather hurried journalism, the main object of which was to explain what had happened, or to describe what had been seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5960"/>Not in these graphic volumes, but in the achievements which gave rise to them, is <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00396.01319" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>'s mental capacity made manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5961"/>He was not only a born commander, prompt, daring, undaunted, irresistible, but also a great administrator, a great practical thinker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5962"/>He thought out his problems with slow, thorough patience, examined every aspect of them, and considered all the possible alternatives, so that when the time came for action he knew what to do, and had no need to hesitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5963"/>His fiery, sudden deeds were more often the result of a long process of thought than of a rapid inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5964"/>The New York correspondent of the <quote>Times,</quote> who knew him well, tells an illustrative story:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5965"/>He and his whole party had embarked on <placeName reg="Lake Tanganyika, Africa, " key="tgn,1118336">Lake Tanganyika</placeName>, knowing that the banks were peopled, some with friendly, some with hostile tribes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5966"/>His canoes moved on at a respectful distance from the nearest shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5967"/>Sometimes the friendly people came off to sell their boat-loads of vegetables and fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5969"/>So <num value="1">one</num> day there approached a fleet of canoes, with all the usual signs of friendly commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5970"/>They were piled high with bananas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5971"/><quote>I thought</quote> (said <persName n="Stanley,,,,," id="n0103.0022.00396.01321" reg="nearbymention:Stanley,Henry,,,"><surname>Stanley</surname></persName>) <quote>they had a large supply, and the boats were deep in the water; still, there was nothing that looked really suspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5972"/>There were just men enough to paddle the canoes; no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5973"/>I let them come close, but I kept my eye on them, and my hand on the trigger of my elephant gun. They were but a few yards off when I saw a heap of bananas stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5974"/>I fired instantly, and instantly the water was black with hundreds of armed black men who had been hidden beneath the banana-heaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5975"/>I do not think many of them got ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5976"/>If I had stopped to think, they would have been aboard us, and it is we who should not have got ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5977"/>But I had done my thinking before they came near.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5979"/>I believe, though he did not say so, that he thought the retreat could have been effected, or the town held, till the <rs>Relief Column</rs> arrived, if proper measures had been taken, and the <num value="1">one</num> definite aim had been kept steadily in view all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5980"/>That was his principle of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5981"/>When he had an object to fulfil, a commission to carry out, he could think of nothing else till the work was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5982"/>Difficulties, toil, hardships, sacrifices of all kinds, of time, of men, of money, were only incidents in the journey that led to a goal, to be reached if human endeavour could gain it. <quote>No honour,</quote> he wrote, <quote>no reward, however great, can be equal to the subtle satisfaction that a man feels when he can point to his work and say: <q direct="unspecified"> See, now, the task I promised you to perform with all loyalty and honesty, with might and main, to the utmost of my ability is, to-day, finished.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5987"/>Great conquerors at the head of an army &mdash; an Alexander, or a Genghis Khan &mdash; may have done as much; but no single individual revolutionised so large a tract of the earth's surface, with only a handful of armed men and a slender column of camp-followers and attendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>To inflict superfluous suffering, to shoot and slay without thinking of the consequences &mdash; this was <hi rend="italics">utterly alien</hi> to his systematic, calculating methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6239"/>Now, however, the <rs>King</rs> expressed his assurance that the time was ripe for the <name>Belgian</name> nation to construct the line, and he was pleased to say that it was my success which had produced this feeling, and that the welcome extended to me was a proof of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6240"/>The next subject was the suppression of the slave-trade in the <rs>Congo</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6241"/>I proposed that troops should be pushed up the <rs>Congo</rs>, and that posts should be established at the mouths of the <name>Aruwimi</name> and Lumami, and that the garrisons should be increased month by month, until about <num value="2000">two thousand</num> troops had been collected, when an onward movement should be made against <placeName reg="Stanley Falls,Orientale,Congo,Africa" key="tgn,1135702">Stanley Falls</placeName>, and the <name>Arab</name> power be summarily broken.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6990"/>But, now that the career is ended, and the <name>Life</name> is closed, I am at liberty to amplify what I would willingly have said, at once, of any promising man who had continued in consistent goodness, that the expectations formed have been fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6991"/>Soon after beginning the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Volume the attention is not so often arrested by signs of youthful vanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7742"/>As the expedition advanced, we generally found villages abandoned, scouts having warned the natives of our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7743"/>The villagers, of course, were not very far off, and, as soon as the expedition had passed, they stole back to their huts and plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7744"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, so great had been their haste, a black baby of a few months old was left on the ground, forgotten.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7750"/>I should rather have liked to take the baby on with me, and would have done so, had I thought it was abandoned; but I felt sure the mother was not far off, and might, even then, be watching us, with beating heart, from behind a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7751"/>So I ordered a fire to be kindled, as the infant was small and chilly, and I had a sort of cradle-nest scooped out of the earth, beside the fire, so that the little creature could be warm, sheltered, and in no danger of rolling in.
