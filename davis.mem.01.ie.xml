<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Inasmuch as questions growing out of the institution of negro servitude, or connected with it, will occupy a conspicuous place in what is to follow, it is important that the reader should have, at the very outset, a right understanding of the true nature and character of those questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>No subject has been more generally misunderstood or more persistently misrepresented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The institution itself has ceased to exist in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; the generation, comprising all who took part in the controversies to which it gave rise, or for which it afforded a pretext, is passing away; the misconceptions which have prevailed in our own country, and still more among foreigners remote from the field of contention, are likely to be perpetuated in the mind of posterity, unless corrected before they become crystallized by tacit acquiescence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>It is well known that at the time of the adoption of the federal Constitution <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> servitude existed in all the states that were parties to that compact, unless with the single exception of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, in which it had, perhaps, very recently ceased to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The slaves, however, were numerous in the <rs>Southern</rs>, and very few in the <rs>Northern</rs>, states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>This diversity was occasioned by differences of climate, soil, and industrial interests&mdash;not in any degree by moral considerations, which at that period were not recognized as an element in the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It was simply because negro labor was more profitable in the <rs>South</rs> than in the <rs>North</rs> that the importation of negro slaves had been, and continued to be, chiefly directed to the <rs>Southern</rs> ports.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> 
<p>It will be remembered that, during her colonial condition, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> made strenuous efforts to prevent the importation of Africans, and was overruled by the <name>Crown</name>; also that <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, under <persName n="Oglethorpe,,,,," id="n0125.0001.00001.00001" reg="mostcommon:Oglethorpe,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName>, did prohibit the introduction of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slaves until <dateStruct value="1752--"><year reg="1752">1752</year></dateStruct>, when the proprietors surrendered the charter, and the colony became a part of the royal government, and enjoyed the same privileges as the other colonies.</p></note> For the same reason slavery was abolished by the states of the <rs>Northern</rs> section (though it existed in several of them for more than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> after the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>), while the importation of slaves into the <rs>South</rs> continued to be carried on by Northern merchants and Northern ships, without interference <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> in the traffic from any quarter, until it was prohibited by the spontaneous action of the <rs>Southern</rs> states themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The Constitution expressly forbade any interference by Congress with the slave trade&mdash;or, to use its own language, with the <quote>migration or importation of such persons</quote> as any of the states should think proper to admit&mdash;<quote>prior to the year <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The reason assigned for this action was the impossibility of enforcing the law without the aid of the federal government, to which entire control of the revenues, revenue police, and naval forces of the country had been surrendered by the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The slave trade had thus been finally abolished some months before the birth of the author of these pages, and has never since had legal existence in any of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The question of the maintenance or extinction of the system of negro servitude already existing in any state was <num value="1">one</num> exclusively belonging to such state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is obvious, therefore, that no subsequent question legitimately arising in federal legislation could properly have any reference to the merits or the policy of the institution itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>A few zealots in the <rs>North</rs> afterward created much agitation by demands for the abolition of slavery within the states by federal intervention, and by their activity and perseverance finally became a recognized party which, holding the balance of power between the <num value="2">two</num> contending organizations in that section, gradually obtained the control of <num value="1">one</num>, and to no small degree corrupted the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The dominant idea, however, at least of the absorbed party, was sectional aggrandizement, looking to absolute control, and theirs is the responsibility for the war that resulted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>No moral nor sentimental considerations were really involved in either the earlier or later controversies which so long agitated and finally ruptured the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They were simply struggles between different sections, with diverse institutions and interests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is absolutely requisite, in order to a right understanding of the history of the country, to bear these truths clearly in mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The phraseology of the period referred to will otherwise be essentially deceptive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The antithetical employment of such terms as <hi rend="italics">freedom</hi> and <hi rend="italics">slavery</hi>, or <quote>antislavery</quote> and <quote>pro-slavery,</quote> with reference to the principles and purposes of contending parties or rival sections, has had immense influence in misleading the opinions and sympathies of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The idea of freedom is captivating, that of slavery repellent to the moral sense of mankind in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is easy, therefore, to understand the effect of applying the <num value="1">one</num> set of terms to <num value="1">one</num> party, the other to another, in a contest which <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> had no just application whatever to the essential merits of freedom or slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Southern statesmen may perhaps have been too indifferent to this consideration&mdash;overlooking in their ardent pursuit of principles, the effects of phrases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This is especially true with regard to that familiar but most fallacious expression, <quote>the extension of slavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>To the reader unfamiliar with the subject, or viewing it only on the surface, it would perhaps never occur that, as used in the great controversies respecting the territories of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, it does not, never did, and never could, imply the addition of a single slave to the number already existing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The question was merely whether the slaveholder should be permitted to go, with his slaves, into territory (the common property of all) into which the nonslaveholder could go with <hi rend="italics">his</hi> property of any sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>There was no proposal nor desire on the part of the <rs>Southern</rs> states to reopen the slave trade, which they had been foremost in suppressing, or to add to the number of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It was a question of the distribution, or dispersion, of the slaves, rather than of the <quote>extension of slavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Removal is not extension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Indeed, if emancipation was the end to be desired, the dispersion of the negroes over a wider area among additional territories, eventually to become states, and in climates unfavorable to slave labor, instead of hindering, would have promoted this object by diminishing the difficulties in the way of ultimate emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The distinction here defined between the distribution, or dispersion, of slaves and the extension of slavery&mdash;<num value="2">two</num> things altogether different, although so generally confounded&mdash;was early and clearly drawn under circumstances and in a connection which justify a fuller notice.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The prayer of these petitions was for a <hi rend="italics">suspension</hi> of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> article of the ordinance, so as to permit the introduction of slaves into the territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The good effects of this suspension, in the present instance, would be to accelerate the population of that Territory, hitherto retarded by the operation of that article of compact; as slaveholders emigrating into the <rs>Western</rs> country might then indulge any preference which they might feel for a settlement in the <placeName reg="Indiana, Indiana, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013794">Indiana Territory</placeName>, instead of seeking, as they are now compelled to do, settlements in other States or countries permitting the introduction of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The condition of the slaves themselves would be much ameliorated by it, as it is evident, from experience, that the more they are separated and diffused the more care and attention are bestowed on them by their masters, each proprietor having it in his power to increase their comforts and conveniences in proportion to the smallness of their numbers.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Their report was sustained by the <rs type="place">House</rs>, and a resolution to suspend the prohibitory article was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The proposition failed, however, in the <name>Senate</name>, and there the matter seems to have been dropped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The proceedings constitute a significant and instructive episode in the political history of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The allusion which has been made to the <name>Ordinance</name> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> renders it proper to notice, very briefly, the argument put forward during the discussion of the <rs>Missouri</rs> question, and often repeated since, that the ordinance afforded a precedent in support of the claim of a power in Congress to determine the question of the admission of slaves into the territories, and in justification of the prohibitory clause applied in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct> to a portion of the <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana Territory</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The difference between the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> and that of the federal Constitution is so broad that the action of the former can, in no just sense, be taken as a precedent for the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> represented the states in their sovereignty, each delegation <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> having <num value="1">one</num> vote, so that all the states were of equal weight in the decision of any question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It had legislative, executive, and in some degree judicial powers, thus combining all departments of government in itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>During its recess a committee known as the <rs>Committee</rs> of the <name>States</name> exercised the powers of the <rs>Congress</rs>, which was in spirit, if not in fact, an assemblage of the states.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>On the other hand, the <rs>Congress</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is only the legislative department of the general government, with powers strictly defined and expressly limited to those delegated by the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It is further held in check by an executive and a judiciary, and consists of <num value="2">two</num> branches, each having peculiar and specified functions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>If, then, it be admitted&mdash;which is at least very questionable&mdash;that the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> had rightfully the power to exclude slave property from the territory northwest of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>, that power must have been derived from its character as an assemblage of the sovereign states; not from the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, in which no indication of the grant of authority to exercise such a function can be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The Congress of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is expressly prohibited from the assumption of any power not distinctly and specifically delegated to it as the legislative branch of an organized government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>What was questionable in the former case, therefore, becomes clearly inadmissible in the latter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But there is yet another material distinction to be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The states, owners of what was called the <rs type="place">Northwestern Territory</rs>, were component members of the <rs>Congress</rs> which adopted the ordinance for its government, and gave thereto their full and free consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The ordinance may, therefore, be regarded as virtually a treaty between the states which ceded and those which received that extensive domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>In the other case, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and the whole region affected by the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> were parts of the territory acquired from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> under the name of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>; as it requires <num value="2">two</num> parties to make or amend a treaty, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should have cooperated in any amendment of the treaty by which <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> had been acquired, and which guaranteed to the inhabitants of the ceded territory <quote>all the rights, advantages, and immunities of citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</quote> and <quote>the free enjoyment of their liberty, property, and religion they profess.</quote><note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>For all the reasons thus stated, it seems to me conclusive that the action of the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> could not constitute a precedent to justify the action of the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> in <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, and that the prohibitory clause of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was without constitutional authority, in violation of the rights of a part of the joint owners of the territory, and in disregard of the obligations of the treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The basis of sectional controversy was the question of the balance of political power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>In its earlier manifestations this was undisguised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The controversy arose out of a proposition to attach to the admission of the new state a proviso prohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The vehement discussion that ensued was continued into the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session of a different Congress from that in which it originated, and agitated the whole country during the interval between the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It was clearly shown in debate that such considerations were altogether irrelevant; that the number of existing slaves would not be affected by their removal from the older states to <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>; and moreover, that the proposed restriction would be contrary to the spirit, if not to the letter, of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>It failed in the <name>Senate</name> through the firm resistance of the <rs>Southern</rs>, aided by a few patriotic and <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> conservative Northern, members of that body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The admission of the new state without any restriction was finally accomplished by the addition to the bill of a section forever prohibiting slavery in all that portion of the <placeName reg="Louisiana, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana Territory</placeName> lying north of <num value="36">thirty-six</num> degrees and <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure>, north latitude, except <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>&mdash;by implication leaving the portion south of that line open to settlement either with or without slaves.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>This provision, as an offset to the admission of the new state without restriction, constituted the celebrated <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>It was reluctantly accepted by a small majority of the <rs>Southern</rs> members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>But it is to be remarked that this law provided for the execution by the general government of obligations which had been imposed by the federal compact upon the several states of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The benefit to be derived from a fulfillment of that law would be small in comparison with the evil to result from the plausible pretext that the states had thus been relieved from a duty which they had assumed in the adoption of the compact of union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Whatever tended to lead the people of any of the states to feel that they could be relieved from their constitutional obligations by transferring them to the general government, or that they might thus or otherwise evade or resist them, could not fail to be like the tares which the enemy sowed amid the wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Consequent upon these was a proposition for a <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">convention of delegates</orgName>, from the people of the <rs>Southern</rs> states respectively, to consider what steps ought to be taken for their future peace and safety, and the preservation of their constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>There was diversity of opinion with regard to the merits of the measures referred to, but the disagreement no longer followed the usual lines of party division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They who saw in those measures the forerunner of disaster to the <rs>South</rs> had no settled policy beyond a convention, the object of which should be to devise new and more effectual guarantees against the perils of usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>They were unjustly charged with a desire to destroy the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;a feeling entertained by few, very few, if by any, in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and avowed by none.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>There were many, however, who held that the principles of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi>, and the purposes for which the <rs>Union</rs> was formed, were of higher value than the mere Union itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Independence existed before the compact of union between the states; and if that compact should be broken in part and therefore destroyed in whole, it was hoped that the liberties of the people in the states might still be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Those who were most devoted to the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> might, consequently, be expected to resist most sternly any usurpation of undelegated power, the effect of which would be to warp the federal government from its proper character, and, by sapping the foundation, to destroy the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the states</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Having, as a Senator of the state, freely participated in debate on the measures which were now exciting so much interest in the public mind, it was very proper that I should visit the people in different parts of the state and render an account of my stewardship.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>My devotion to the <rs>Union</rs> of our fathers had been so often and so publicly declared; I had, on the floor of the <name>Senate</name>, so defiantly challenged any question of my fidelity to it; my services, civil and military, had now extended through so long a period, and were so generally known&mdash;that I felt quite assured that no whisperings of envy or ill will could lead the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to believe that I had dishonored their trust by using the power they had conferred on me to destroy the government to which I was accredited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Then, as afterward, I regarded the separation of the states as a great, though not the greatest, evil.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I returned from my tour among the people at the time appointed for the meeting of the nominating convention of the <rs>Democratic</rs> (or <orgName n="State Rights party" type="party">State-Rights) party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The charges were not sustained; many of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName></orgName>, myself included, recognized a consequent obligation to renominate him for the office of which he had been deprived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>When, however, the delegates met in party convention, the committee appointed to select candidates, on comparison of opinions, concluded that, in view of the effort to fix upon the party the imputation of a purpose of disunion, some of the antecedents of <persName n="Quitman,General,,,," id="n0125.0003.00017.00038" reg="nearbymention:Quitman,John,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Quitman</surname></persName> might endanger success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>A proposition was therefore made, in the committee on nominations, that I should be invited to become a candidate, and that, if <persName n="Quitman,General,,,," id="n0125.0003.00017.00039" reg="nearbymention:Quitman,John,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Quitman</surname></persName> would withdraw, my acceptance of the nomination and the resignation of my place in the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>I offered no objection to this arrangement, but left it to <persName n="Quitman,General,,,," id="n0125.0003.00017.00041" reg="nearbymention:Quitman,John,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Quitman</surname></persName> to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Happy in the peaceful pursuits of a planter, busily engaged in cares for servants, in the improvement of my land, in building, in rearing livestock, and the like occupations, the time passed pleasantly away until my retirement was interrupted by an invitation to take a place in the cabinet of <persName n="Pierce,,,,," id="n0125.0004.00020.00050" reg="nearbymention:Pierce,Franklin,,,"><surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, who had been elected to the presidency of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1852-11-"><month reg="11">November</month>, <year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Although warmly attached to <persName n="Pierce,,,,," id="n0125.0004.00020.00051" reg="nearbymention:Pierce,Franklin,,,"><surname>Pierce</surname></persName> personally, and entertaining the highest estimate of his character and political principles, private and personal reasons led me to decline the offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>This was followed by an invitation to attend the ceremony of his inauguration, which took place on <dateStruct value="1853-03-04"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>While in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> on this visit, I was induced by public considerations to reconsider my determination and accept the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The public records of that period will best show how the duties of that office were performed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>While in the <name>Senate</name>, I had advocated the construction of a railway to connect the <rs type="place">valley of the Mississippi</rs> with the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>; when an appropriation was made to determine the most eligible route for that purpose, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> was charged with its application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We had then but little of that minute and accurate knowledge of the interior of the continent which was requisite for a determination of the problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Several different parties were therefore organized to examine the various routes supposed to be practicable within the northern and southern limits of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The arguments which I had used as a Senator were <quote>the military necessity for such means of transportation, and the need of safe and rapid communication with the <rs>Pacific</rs> slope, to secure its continuance as a part of the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/></p> 
<p>In the organization and equipment of these parties, and in the selection of their officers, care was taken to provide for securing full and accurate information upon every point involved in the determination of the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The only discrimination made was in the more prompt and thorough equipment of the parties for the extreme northern line, and <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> this was only because that was supposed to be the most difficult of execution of all the surveys.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>In like manner, my advocacy while in the <name>Senate</name> of an extension of the <rs>Capitol</rs>, by the construction of a new <placeName reg="Senate Chamber">Senate Chamber</placeName> and <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n0125.0004.00021.00052" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName> of Representatives, may have caused the appropriation for that object to be put under my charge as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>During my administration of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, material changes were made in the models of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Iron gun carriages were introduced, and experiments were made which led to the casting of heavy guns hollow, instead of boring them after casting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Inquiries were made with regard to gunpowder which subsequently led to the use of a coarser grain for artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>During the same period the army was increased by the addition of <num value="2">two</num> regiments of infantry and <num value="2">two</num> of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The officers of these regiments were chosen partly by selection from those already in service in the regular army and partly by appointment from civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>In making the selections from the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> I was continually indebted to the assistance of that pure-minded and accurately informed officer, <persName n="Cooper,Colonel,Samuel,,," id="n0125.0004.00021.00053" reg="default:Cooper,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, of whom it may be proper here to say that, although his life had been spent in the army, and he, of course, had the likes and dislikes inseparable from men who are brought into close contact and occasional rivalry, I never found in his official recommendations any indication of partiality or prejudice toward any <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>When the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> list was made out, to be submitted to the <rs>President</rs>, a difficulty was found to exist which had not occurred either to <persName n="Cooper,Colonel,,,," id="n0125.0004.00021.00054" reg="nearbymention:Cooper,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName> or myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>This was that the officers selected purely on their military record did not constitute a roster conforming to that distribution among the different states, which, for political considerations, it was thought desirable to observe&mdash;that is to say, the number of such officers of Southern birth was found to be disproportionately great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Under instructions from the <rs>President</rs>, the list was therefore revised and modified in accordance with this new element of geographical distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This, as I am happy to remember, was the only occasion in which the current of my official action while <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> was disturbed in any way by sectional or political considerations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Under former administrations of the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName> it had not been customary to make removals or appointments upon political grounds, except in the case of clerkships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>To this usage I not only adhered, but extended it to include the clerkships also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief Clerk">chief clerk</rs>, who had been removed by my predecessor, had peculiar qualifications for the place; <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> although known to me only officially, he was restored to the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It will probably be conceded by all who are well informed on the subject that his restoration was a benefit to the public service<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> 
<p> Soon after my entrance upon duty as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, <persName n="Jesup,General,,,," id="n0125.0004.00022.00055" reg="mostcommon:Jesup,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jesup</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs>, presented to me a list of names from which to make selection of a clerk for his department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Observing that he had attached certain figures to these names, I asked whether the figures were intended to indicate the relative qualifications, or preference in his estimation, of the several applicants; and, upon his answer in the affirmative, without further question, authorized him to appoint <quote><num value="1">No. 1</num></quote> of his list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>A day or <num value="2">two</num> afterward, certain Democratic members of Congress called on me and politely inquired whether it was true that I had appointed a Whig to a position in the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>. <quote>Certainly not,</quote> I answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/><quote>We thought you were not aware of it,</quote> they said, and proceeded to inform me that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>&mdash;, the recent appointee to the clerkship just mentioned, was a Whig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>After listening patiently to this statement, I answered that it was they who were deceived, not I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>I had appointed a clerk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He had been appointed neither as a Whig nor as a Democrat, but merely as the fittest candidate for the place in the estimation of the chief of the bureau to which it belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>I further gave them to understand that the same principle of selecion would be followed in similar cases, so far as my authority extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>After some further discussion of the question, the visitors withdrew, dissatisfied with the result of the interview.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs>, on hearing of this conversation, hastened to inform me that it was all a mistake &mdash; that the appointee to the office had been confounded with his father, who was a well-known Whig, but that he (the son) was a Democrat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>I assured the <rs>General</rs> that this was altogether immaterial, adding that it was <quote>a very pretty quarrel</quote> as it stood, and that I had no desire to effect a settlement of it on any inferior issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Thenceforth, however, I was but little troubled with any pressure for political appointments in the department.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>As this occupies a large space in the political history of the period, it is proper to state some facts connected with it which were not public, but were known to me and to others yet living.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The declaration, often repeated in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, that climate and the will of the people concerned should determine their institutions when they should form a constitution, and as a state be admitted into the <rs>Union</rs>, and that no legislation by Congress should be permitted to interfere with the free exercise of that will when so expressed, was but the announcement of the fact so firmly established in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that sovereignty resided alone in the states, and that Congress had only delegated powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It has been sometimes contended that because the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName>, by the <name>Ordinance</name> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, prohibited involuntary servitude in all the <rs type="place">Northwestern Territory</rs>, the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> must have recognized such power to exist in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Hence the deduction that the prohibitory clause of what is known as the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs> was justified by the precedent of the <name>Ordinance</name> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>To make the action of the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> a precedent for the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> is to overlook the great distinction between the <num value="2">two</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> represented the states in their sovereignty; as such representatives, it had legislative, executive, and, in some degree, judicial power confided to it. Virtually, it was an assemblage of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>In certain cases a majority of <num value="9">nine</num> states were required <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> to decide a question, but there is no express limitation, or restriction, such as is to be found in the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> and <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> amendments to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The general government of the <rs>Union</rs> is composed of <num value="3">three</num> departments, of which the <rs>Congress</rs> is the legislative branch, and which is checked by the revisory power of the judiciary, and the veto of the executive, and, above all, is expressly limited in legislation to powers expressly delegated by the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>If, then, it be admitted, which is certainly questionable, that the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> had power to exclude slave property northwest of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>, that power must have been derived from its character as representing the states in their sovereignty, for no indication of such a power is to be found in the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>If it be assumed that the absence of a prohibition was equivalent to the admission of the power in the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName>, the assumption would avail nothing in the <rs>Congress</rs> under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, where power is expressly limited to what has been delegated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>More briefly, it may be stated that the <orgName n="Confederation Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederation</orgName> could, like the legislature of a state, do what had not been prohibited; but the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> could only do what had been expressly permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is submitted whether this last position is not conclusive against the possession of power by the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName> to legislate slavery into or exclude it from territories belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>This subject, which had for more than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century been <num value="1">one</num> of angry discussion and sectional strife, was revived, and found occasion for renewed discussion in the organization of territorial governments for <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The Committees on Territories of the <num value="2">two</num> houses agreed to report a bill in accordance with that recognized principle, provided they could <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be assured that it would receive favorable consideration from the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>This agreement was made on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and the ensuing <rs>Monday</rs> was the day (and the only day for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>) on which, according to the order of business established by the rules of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, the bill could be introduced by the committee of that house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, <dateStruct value="1854-01-22"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="22">22</day>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, gentlemen of each committee called at my house; <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0125.0005.00024.00063" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, chairman of the <orgName n="Senate Committee" type="committee">Senate committee</orgName>, fully explained the proposed bill, and stated their purpose to be, through my aid, to obtain an interview on that day with the <rs>President</rs>, to ascertain whether the bill would meet his approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> was known to be rigidly opposed to the reception of visits on Sunday for <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> the discussion of any political subject, but in this case it was urged as necessary, in order to enable the committee to make their report the next day. I went with them to the executive mansion, and, leaving them in the reception room, sought the <rs>President</rs> in his private apartments and explained to him the occasion of the visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>He thereupon met the gentlemen, patiently listened to the reading of the bill and their explanations of it, decided that it rested upon sound constitutional principles, and recognized in it only a return to that rule which had been infringed by the compromise of <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, and the restoration of which had been foreshadowed by the legislation of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>This bill was not, therefore, as has been improperly asserted, a measure inspired by <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0005.00025.00064" reg="nearbymention:Pierce,Franklin,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> or any of his cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Nor was it the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step taken toward the repeal of the conditions or obligations expressed or implied by the establishment, in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, of the politico-sectional line of <num value="36">thirty-six</num> degrees and <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure>. That compact had been virtually abrogated, in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, by the refusal of the representatives of the <rs>North</rs> to apply it to the territory then recently acquired from <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In <dateStruct value="1854-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill was passed; its purpose was declared in the bill itself to be to carry into practical operation the <quote>propositions and principles established by the compromise measures of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The Missouri Compromise, therefore, was not repealed by that bill&mdash;its virtual repeal by the legislation of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> was recognized as an existing fact, and it was declared to be <quote>inoperative and void.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/></p> 
<p>It was added that the <quote>true intent and meaning</quote> of the act was <quote>not to legislate slavery into any Territory or State, nor to exclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</quote>

<p>From the terms of this bill, as well as from the arguments that were used in its behalf, it is evident that its purpose was to leave the territories equally open to the people of all the states, with every species of property recognized by any of them; to permit climate and soil to determine the current of immigration, and to secure to the people themselves the right to form their own institutions according to their own will, as soon as they should acquire the right of self-government; that is to say, as soon as their numbers should entitle them to organize themselves into a state, prepared to take its place as an equal, sovereign member of the federal Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Sectional rivalry, the deadly foe of the <quote>domestic tranquillity</quote> and the <quote>general welfare,</quote> which the compact of union was formed to insure, now interfered, with gigantic efforts to prevent that free migration which had been promised, and to hinder the decision by climate and the interests of the inhabitants of the institutions to be established by these embryo states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Societies were formed in the <rs>North</rs> to supply money and send emigrants into the new territories; a famous preacher, addressing a body of those emigrants, charged them to carry with them to <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> <quote>the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and <orgName n="rifles"><persName n="Sharpe,,,,," id="n0125.0005.00026.00066" reg="mostcommon:Sharpe,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharpe</surname></persName>'s rifles</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The latter were of course to be leveled against the bosoms of their Southern brethren who might migrate to the same territory, but the use to be made of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> in the same fraternal enterprise was left unexplained by the reverend gentleman.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The war-cry employed to train the <rs>Northern</rs> mind for the deeds contemplated by the agitators was <quote>No extension of slavery!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Was this sentiment real or feigned?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The number of slaves (as has already been clearly shown) would not have been increased by their transportation to new territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>It could not be augmented by further importation, for the law of the land made that piracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Southern men were the leading authors of that enactment, and the public opinion of their descendants, stronger than the law, fully sustained it. The climate of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> was altogether unsuited to the negro, and the soil was not adapted to those productions for which negro labor could be profitably employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>If, then, any negroes held to service or labor, as provided in the compact of union, had been transported to those territories, they would have been such as were bound by personal attachment mutually existing between master and servant, which would have rendered it impossible for the former to consider the latter as property convertible into money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>As white laborers, adapted to the climate and its products, flowed into the country, negro labor would have inevitably become a tax to those who held it, and their emancipation would have followed that condition, as it has in all the <rs>Northern</rs> states, old or new&mdash;<placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName> furnishing the last example.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The success attending this artifice was remarkable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Diversity of interests and of opinions among the states of the <name>Confederation</name> had in the beginning presented great difficulties in the way of the formation of a more perfect union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The compact was the result of compromise between the states, at that time generally distinguished as navigating and agricultural, afterward as Northern and Southern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>When the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> census was taken, in <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, there was but little numerical difference in the population of these <num value="2">two</num> sections, and (including states <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> about to be admitted) there was also an exact equality in the number of states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Each section had, therefore, the power of self-protection, and might feel secure against any danger of federal aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>If the disturbance of that equilibrium had been the consequence of natural causes, and the government of the whole had continued to be administered strictly for the general welfare, there would have been no ground for complaint of the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Under the old Confederation the <rs>Southern</rs> states had a large excess of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The acquisition of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, afterward greatly increased this excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The generosity and patriotism of Virgina led her, before the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to cede the <rs type="place">Northwest Territory</rs> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The Missouri Compromise surrendered to the <rs>North</rs> all the newly acquired region not included in the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">state of Missouri</placeName>, and north of the parallel of <num value="36">thirty-six</num> degrees and <num value="0.5">a half</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The northern part of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> was in like manner given up by the compromise of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>; and the <rs>North</rs>, having obtained, by those successive cessions, a majority in both houses of Congress, took to itself all the territory acquired from <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Thus, by the action of the general government, the means were provided permanently to destroy the original equilibrium between the sections.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Nor was this the only injury to which the <rs>South</rs> was subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Under the power of Congress to levy duties on imports, tariff laws were enacted, not merely <quote>to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</quote> as authorized by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but, positively and primarily, for the protection against foreign competition of domestic manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The effect of this was to impose the main burden of taxation upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people, who were consumers and not manufacturers, not only by the enhanced price of imports, but indirectly by the consequent depreciation in the value of exports, which were chiefly the products of Southern states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The imposition of this grievance was unaccompanied by the consolation of knowing that the tax thus borne was to be paid into the public treasury, for the increase of price accrued mainly to the benefit of the manufacturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Nor was this all: a reference to the annual appropriations will show that the disbursements made were as unequal as the burdens borne&mdash;the inequality in both operating in the same direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>These causes all combined to direct immigration to the <rs>Northern</rs> section; and with the increase of its preponderance appeared more and more distinctly a tendency in the federal government to pervert functions <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> delegated to it, and to use them with sectional discrimination against the minority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The resistance to the admission of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> as a state in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct> was evidently not owing to any moral or constitutional considerations, but merely to political motives; the compensation exacted for granting what was simply a right was the exclusion of the <rs>South</rs> from equality in the enjoyment of territory which justly belonged equally to both, and which was what the enemies of the <rs>South</rs> stigmatized as <quote>slave territory,</quote> when acquired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The sectional policy then indicated brought to its support the passions that spring from man's higher nature, but which, like all passions, if misdirected and perverted, become hurtful and, it may be, destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The year <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct> was marked by the public agitation for the abolition of that <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> servitude which existed in the <rs>South</rs>, which antedated the <rs>Union</rs>, and had existed in every <num value="1">one</num> of the states that formed the <name>Confederation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>By a great misconception of the powers belonging to the general government, and the responsibilities of citizens of the <rs>Northern</rs> states, many of those citizens were, little by little, brought to the conclusion that slavery was a sin for which <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were answerable, and that it was the duty of the federal government to abate it. Though, at the date above referred to, numerically so weak, when compared with either of the political parties at the <rs>North</rs>, as to excite no apprehension of their power for evil, the public demonstrations of the <name>Abolitionists</name> were violently rebuked generally at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The party was contemned on account of the character of its leaders, and the more odious because chief among them was an Englishman, <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n0125.0005.00029.00069" reg="mostcommon:Thompson,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName>, who was supposed to be an emissary, whose mission was to prepare the way for a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Let us hope that it was reverence for the obligations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as the soul of the <rs>Union</rs> that suggested lurking danger, and rendered the supposed emissary for its destruction so odious that he was driven from a Massachusetts hall where he attempted to lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>But bodies in motion will overcome bodies at rest, and the unreflecting too often are led by captivating names far from the principles they revere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Thus, by the activity of the propagandists of abolitionism, and the misuse of the sacred word Liberty, they recruited from the ardent worshipers of that goddess such numbers as gave them in many Northern states the balance of power between the <num value="2">two</num> great political forces that stood arrayed against each other; then and there they came to be courted by both of the great parties, especially by the <rs>Whigs</rs>, who had become the weaker party of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Fanaticism, to which is usually accorded <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> sincerity as an extenuation of its mischievous tenets, affords the best excuse to be offered for the original abolitionists, but that cannot be conceded to the political associates who joined them for the purpose of acquiring power; with them it was but hypocritical cant, intended to deceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Hence arose the declaration of the existence of an <quote>irrepressible conflict,</quote> because of the domestic institutions of sovereign, selfgovern-ing states&mdash;institutions over which neither the federal government nor the people outside of the limits of such states had any control, and for which they could have no moral or legal responsibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Those who are to come after us, and who will look without prejudice or excitement at the record of events which have occurred in our day, will not fail to wonder how men professing and proclaiming such a belief should have so far imposed upon the credulity of the world as to be able to arrogate to themselves the claim of being the special friends of a Union contracted in order to insure <quote>domestic tranquillity</quote> among the people of the states united; that <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were the advocates of peace, of law, and of order, who, when taking an oath to support and maintain the <rs>Constitution</rs>, did so with a mental reservation to violate <num value="1">one</num> of the provisions of that Constitution&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of the conditions of the compact&mdash; without which the <rs>Union</rs> could never have been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The tone of political morality which could make this possible was well indicated by the toleration accorded in the <name>Senate</name> to the flippant, inconsequential excuse for it given by <num value="1">one</num> of its most eminent exemplars&mdash;<quote>Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?</quote>&mdash;meaning thereby, not that it would be the part of a dog to <hi rend="italics">violate</hi> his oath, but to <hi rend="italics">keep</hi> it in the matter referred to.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Meantime the changes or modifications which had occurred or were occurring in the great political parties were such as may require a word of explanation to the reader not already familiar with their history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The names adopted by political parties in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have not always been strictly significant of their principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The old <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName> inclined to nationalism or consolidation, rather than federalization of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>On the other hand, the party originally known as Republican, and afterward as Democratic, can scarcely claim to have been distinctively or exclusively such in the primary sense of these terms, inasmuch as no party has ever avowed opposition to the general principles of government by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The fundamental idea of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> was that of the sovereignty of the states and the federal, or confederate, character of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Other elements have entered into its organization at different periods, but this has been the vital, cardinal, and abiding principle on which its existence has been perpetuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The Whig, which succeeded the old <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName>, though by no means identical with it, was in the main favorable to a strong central government, therein antagonizing the transatlantic traditions connected with its name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The <quote>Know-nothing,</quote> or <quote>American</quote> party, which sprang into existence on the decadence of the <rs>Whig</rs> organization, based upon opposition to the alleged overgrowth of the political influence of naturalized foreigners and of the <rs>Roman</rs> <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>, had but a brief duration, and after the presidential election of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> declined as rapidly as it had risen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>At the period to which this narrative has advanced, the <quote>Free-soil,</quote> which had now assumed the title of <quote>Republican</quote> party, had grown to a magnitude which threatened speedily to obtain entire control of the <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Based, as has been shown, upon sectional rivalry and opposition to the growth of the <rs>Southern</rs> equally with the <rs>Northern</rs> states of the <rs>Union</rs>, it had absorbed within itself not only the abolitionists, who were avowedly agitating for the destruction of the system of negro servitude, but other diverse and heterogeneous elements of opposition to the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In the presidential election of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, their candidates (<persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0125.0006.00032.00071" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,John,C.,,:3"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dayton,,,,," id="n0125.0006.00032.00072" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><surname>Dayton</surname></persName>) had received <num value="114">114</num> of a total of <num value="296">296</num> electoral votes, representing a popular vote of <num value="1341264">1,341,264</num> in a total of <num value="4053967">4,053,967</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The elections of the ensuing year (<dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>) exhibited a diminution of the so-called Republican strength, and the <num value="35" type="ordinal">Thirty-fifth</num> Congress, which convened in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> of that year, was decidedly Democratic in both branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>In the course of the next <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, however, the <rs>Kansas</rs> agitation and another cause, to be presently noticed, had so swollen the ranks of the so-called Republicans that, in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of the <num value="36" type="ordinal">Thirty-sixth</num> Congress, which met in <dateStruct value="1859-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, neither party had a decided majority, the balance of power being held by a few members still adhering to the virtually extinct Whig and American (or Know-Nothing) organizations, and a still smaller number whose position was doubtful or irregular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>More than <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> were spent in the election of a Speaker, and a so-called Republican (<persName n="Pennington,,,,," id="n0125.0006.00032.00073" reg="mostcommon:Pennington,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Pennington</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>) was finally elected by a majority of <num value="1">one</num> vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The Senate continued to be decidedly Democratic, though with an increase of the so-called Republican minority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The cause above alluded to, as contributing to the rapid growth of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> after the elections of the year <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, was the dissension among the <name>Democrats</name>, occasioned by the introduction of the doctrine called by its inventors and advocates <quote>popular sovereignty,</quote> or <quote>nonin-tervention,</quote> but more generally and more accurately known as <quote>squatter sovereignty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Its character has already been concisely stated in the preceding chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It remains only to add that I supported <persName n="Cass,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0006.00033.00079" reg="mostcommon:Cass,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName>, not because of the doctrine of the <rs>Nicholson</rs> letter, but in despite of it; because I believed a Democratic <rs type="role2">President</rs>, with a Democratic Cabinet and Democratic counselors in the <num value="2">two</num> houses of Congress, and he as honest a man as I believed <persName n="Cass,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0006.00033.00080" reg="mostcommon:Cass,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> to be, would be a safer reliance than his opponent, who personally possessed my confidence as much as any man living, but who was of, and must draw his advisers from, a party the tenets of which I believed to be opposed to the interests of the country, as they were to all my political convictions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I little thought at that time that my advocacy of <persName n="Cass,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0006.00033.00081" reg="mostcommon:Cass,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> upon such grounds as these, or his support by the <rs>State</rs> of which I am a citizen, would at any future day be quoted as an endorsement of the opinions contained in the <rs>Nicholson</rs> letter, as those opinions were afterward defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>But it is not only upon this letter, but equally upon the resolutions of the <rs>Convention</rs> as constructive of that letter, that the <rs>Senator</rs> rested his argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>[I will here say to the <rs>Senator</rs> that, if at any time I do him the least injustice, speaking as I do from such notes as I could take while he progressed, I will thank him to correct me.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>But this letter entered into the canvass; there was a doubt about its construction: there were men who asserted that they had positive authority for saying that it meant that the people of a Territory could only exclude slavery when the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> should form a Constitution and be admitted as a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>This doubt continued to hang over the construction, and it was that doubt alone which secured <persName n="Cass,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0006.00033.00082" reg="mostcommon:Cass,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> the vote of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>In the organization of a government for <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, the theory was more distinctly advanced, but it was not until after the passage of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, that it was fully developed under the plastic and constructive genius of <persName n="Douglas,the Honorable,Stephen,A.,," id="n0125.0006.00033.00084" reg="default:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The leading part which that distinguished <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> had borne in the authorship and advocacy of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> bill, which affirmed the right of the people of the territories <quote>to form and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>,</quote> had aroused against him a violent storm of denunciation in the state which he represented and in other Northern states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>He met it very manfully in some respects, and defended his action resolutely, but in so doing was led to make such concessions of principle and to attach such an interpretation to the bill as would have <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> rendered it practically nugatory&mdash;a thing to keep the promise of peace to the ear and break it to the hope.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>The Constitution expressly confers upon Congress the power to admit new states into the <rs>Union</rs>, and also to <quote>dispose of and make all needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other property belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Under these grants of power, the uniform practice of the government had been for Congress to lay off and divide the common territory by convenient boundaries for the formation of future states; to provide executive, legislative, and judicial departments of government for such territories during their temporary and provisional period of pupilage; to delegate to these governments such authority as might be expedient&mdash;subject always to the supervision and controlling government of the <rs>Congress</rs>; and finally, at the proper time, and on the attainment by the territory of sufficient strength and population for self-government, to receive it into the <rs>Union</rs> on a footing of entire equality with the original states&mdash;sovereign and self-governing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>All this is no more inconsistent with the true principles of <quote>popular sovereignty,</quote> properly understood, than the temporary subjection of a minor to parental control is inconsistent with the doctrines of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi>, or the exceptional discipline of a man-of-war or a military post with the principles of republican freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The usual process of transition from a territorial condition to that of a state was, in the first place, by an act of Congress authorizing the inhabitants to elect representatives for a convention to form a state constitution, which was then submitted to Congress for approval and ratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>On such ratification the supervisory control of Congress was withdrawn and the new state authorized to assume its sovereignty, and the inhabitants of the territory became citizens of a state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>In the cases of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>, the failure of the inhabitants to obtain an <quote>enabling act</quote> of Congress before organizing themselves very nearly caused the rejection of their applications for admission as states, though they were eventually granted on the ground that the subsequent approval and consent of Congress could heal the prior irregularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The entire control of Congress over the whole subject of territorial government had never been questioned in earlier times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Necessarily conjoined with the power of this protectorate was, of course, the duty of exercising it for the safety of the persons and property of all citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> permanently or temporarily resident in any part of the domain belonging to the states in common.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Logically carried out, the new theory of <quote>popular sovereignty</quote> <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> would apply to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adventurous pioneers settling in the wilderness before the organization of any territorial government by Congress, as well as afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>If <quote>sovereignty</quote> is inherent in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> persons, there can be no valid ground for denying its existence in a dozen, as soon as they pass beyond the limits of the state governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The advocates of this novel doctrine, however, if rightly understood, generally disavowed any claim to its application prior to the organization of a territorial government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The territory legislatures, to which Congress delegated a portion of its power and duty to <quote>make all needful rules and regulations respecting the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>,</quote> were the mere agents of Congress, exercising an authority subject to Congressional supervision and control &mdash; an authority conferred only for the sake of convenience, and liable at any time to be revoked and annulled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Yet it is proposed to recognize in these provisional, subordinate, and temporary legislative bodies a power not possessed by Congress itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>This is to claim that the creature is endowed with an authority not possessed by the creator, or that the stream has risen to an elevation above that of its source.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Furthermore, in contending for a power in the territorial legislatures permanently to determine the fundamental, social, and political institutions of the territory, and thereby virtually to prescribe those of the future state, the advocates of <quote>popular sovereignty</quote> were investing those dependent and subsidiary bodies with powers far above any exercised by the legislatures of the fully organized and sovereign states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The authority of the state legislatures is limited, both by the federal Constitution and by the respective state Constitutions from which it is derived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>This latter limitation did not and could not exist in the territories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Strange as it may seem, a theory founded on fallacies so flimsy and leading to conclusions so paradoxical was advanced by eminent and experienced politicians, and accepted by many persons, both in the <rs>North</rs> and in the <rs>South</rs>--not so much, perhaps, from intelligent conviction as under the delusive hope that it would afford a satisfactory settlement of the <quote>irrepressible conflict</quote> which had been declared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The terms <quote>popular sovereignty</quote> and <quote>non-intervention</quote> were plausible, specious, and captivating to the public ear. Too many lost sight of the elementary truth that political sovereignty does not reside in unorganized or partially organized masses of individuals, but in the people of regularly and permanently constituted states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>As to the <quote>noninter-vention</quote> proposed, it meant merely the abnegation by Congress of its <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> duty to protect the inhabitants of the territories subject to its control.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>I say brilliant history; for it was in the very morning of her existence that her sons, on the plains of New Orleans, were announced, in general orders, to have been the admiration of <num value="1">one</num> army and the wonder of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>That we had a division in relation to the measures enacted in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, is true; that the <rs>Southern</rs> rights men became the minority in the election which resulted, is true; but no figure of speech could warrant the <rs>Senator</rs> in speaking of them as subdued &mdash; as coming to him or anybody else for quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>I deemed it offensive when it was uttered, and the scorn with which I repelled it at the instant, time has only softened to contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>How we have wielded that power it is not for me to say.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>It required all the power of wisdom and patriotism, animated by the affection engendered by common sufferings and dangers, to keep these rivalries under restraint, and to effect those compromises which it was fondly hoped would insure the harmony and mutual good offices of each for the benefit of all. It was in this spirit of patriotism and confidence in the continuance of such abiding good will as would for all time preclude hostile aggression, that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ceded, for the use of the confederated states, all that vast extent of territory lying north of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>, out of which have since been formed <num value="5">five</num> states and part of a <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>The addition of these states has accrued entirely to the preponderance of the <rs>Northern</rs> section over that from which the donation proceeded, and to the disturbance of that equilibrium which existed at the close of the war of the <name>Revolution</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>It may not be out of place here to refer to the fact that the grievances which led to that war were directly inflicted upon the <rs>Northern</rs> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Those of the <rs>South</rs> had no material cause of complaint; actuated by sympathy for their Northern brethren, however, and a devotion to the principles of civil liberty and community independence, which they had inherited from their Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0125.0007.00041.00096" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> ancestry, and which were set forth in the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi>, they made common cause with their neighbors, and may, at least, claim to have done their full share in the war that ensued.

This inequality, which began, as has been shown, in the more generous than wise confidence of the <rs>South</rs>, was employed to obtain for the <rs>North</rs> the lion's share of what was afterward added at the cost of the public treasure and the blood of patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Nor was this the only cause that operated to disappoint the reasonable hopes and to blight the fair prospects under which the original compact was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The effects of discriminating duties upon imports have been referred to in a former chapter&mdash;favoring the manufacturing region, which was the <rs>North</rs>; burdening the exporting region, which was the <rs>South</rs>; and so imposing upon the latter a double tax; <num value="1">one</num>, by the increased price of articles of consumption, which, so far as they were of home production, went into the pockets of the manufacturer; the other, by the diminished value of articles of export, which was so much withheld from the pockets of the agriculturist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>In like manner the power of the majority section was employed to appropriate to itself an unequal share of the public disbursements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>These combined causes&mdash;the possession of more territory, more money, and a wider field for the employment of special labor&mdash;all served to attract immigration; with increasing population, the greed grew by what it fed on.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It was a purely sectional body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>The resolutions adopted contained some carefully worded declarations, well adapted to deceive the credulous who were opposed to hostile aggressions upon the rights of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>In order to accomplish this purpose, they were compelled to create a fictitious issue, in denouncing what they described as <quote>the new dogma that the <rs>Constitution</rs>, of its own force, carries slavery into any or all of the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></quote>&mdash;a <quote>dogma</quote> which had never been held or declared by anybody, and which had no existence outside of their own assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>There was enough in connection with the nomination to assure the most fanatical foes of the <rs>Constitution</rs> that their ideas would be the rule and guide of the party.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>This discrepancy was owing to the system of voting by <quote>general ticket</quote>&mdash;that is, casting the state votes as a unit, whether unanimous or nearly equally divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>With very rare exceptions, there were none in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> who claimed the right of the federal government to apply coercion to a state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>In <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> men had grown to be familiar with threats of driving the <rs>South</rs> into submission to any act that the government, in the hands of a Northern majority, might see fit to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>During the canvass of that year, demonstrations had been made by quasi-military organizations in various parts of the <rs>North</rs>, which looked unmistakably to purposes widely different from those enunciated in the preamble to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and to the employment of means not authorized by the powers which the states had delegated to the federal government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Well-informed men still remembered that, in the convention which framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>, a proposition was made to authorize the employment of force against a delinquent state, on which <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0125.0007.00048.00128" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> remarked that <quote>the use of force against a state would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous compacts by which it might have been bound.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>The convention expressly refused to confer the power proposed, and the clause was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>While, therefore, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, many violent men, appealing to passion and the lust of power, were inciting the multitude, and preparing Northern opinion to support a war waged against the <rs>Southern</rs> states in the event of their secession, there were others who took a different view of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Notable among such was the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName></hi>, which had been the organ of the abolitionists, and which now declared that, <quote>if the cotton States wished to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, they should be allowed to do so</quote>; that <quote>any attempt to compel them to remain, by force, would be contrary to the principles of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi> and to the fundamental ideas upon which human liberty is based</quote>; and that, <quote>if the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi> justified the secession from the <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> <persName n="Empire,,British,,," id="n0125.0007.00049.00129" reg="default:Empire,British,,,"><foreName>British</foreName> <surname>Empire</surname></persName> of <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of subjects in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, it was not seen why it would not justify the secession of <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of Southerners from the <rs>Union</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Again, it was said by the same journal that <quote>sooner than compromise with the <rs>South</rs> and abandon the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform,</quote> they would <quote>let the <rs>Union</rs> slide.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Taunting expressions were freely used&mdash;as, for example, <quote>If the <rs>Southern</rs> people wish to leave the <rs>Union</rs> we will do our best to forward their views.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The message was, however, afterward somewhat changed, and with great deference to the wisdom and statesmanship of its author, I must say that, in my judgment, the last alterations were unfortunate&mdash;so much so that, when it was read in the <name>Senate</name>, I was reluctantly constrained to criticise it. Compared, however, with documents of the same class which have since been addressed to the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, the reader of presidential messages must regret that it was not accepted by <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0125.0008.00051.00140" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:6"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s successors as a model, and that his views of the <rs>Constitution</rs> had not been adopted as a guide in the subsequent action of the federal government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Hopes were still cherished that the <rs>Northern</rs> leaders would appreciate the impending peril, would cease to treat the warnings, so often given, as idle threats, would refrain from the bravado, so often and so unwisely indulged, of ability <quote>to whip the <rs>South</rs></quote> in <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="60">sixty</num>, or <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, and would address themselves to the more manly purpose of devising means to allay the indignation, and quiet the apprehensions, whether well founded or not, of their Southern brethren.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, if the political firmament seemed to me dark before, there has been little in the discussion this morning to cheer or illumine it. When the proposition of the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> was presented&mdash;not very hopeful of a good result&mdash;I was yet willing to wait and see what developments it might produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>This morning, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, it has been considered; and what of encouragement have we received?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/><num value="1">One</num> <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> proposes, as a cure for the public evil impending over us, to invest the <rs>Federal Government</rs> with such physical power as properly belongs to monarchy alone; another announces that his constituents cling to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, if its legislative favors and its Treasury secure works of improvement and the facilities which they desire; while another rises to point out that the evils of the land are of a party character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Sir, we have fallen upon evil times indeed, if the great convulsion which now shakes the body-politic <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> to its center is to be dealt with by such nostrums as these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Men must look more deeply, must rise to a higher altitude; like patriots they must confront the danger face to face, if they hope to relieve the evils which now disturb the peace of the land, and threaten the destruction of our political existence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all, we must inquire what is the cause of the evils which beset us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The diagnosis of the disease must be stated before we are prepared to prescribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Is it the fault of our legislation here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>If so, then it devolves upon us to correct it, and we have the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Is it the defect of the <rs>Federal</rs> organization, of the fundamental law of our Union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>I hold that it is not. Our fathers, learning wisdom from the experiments of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>&mdash;the <num value="1">one</num> a consolidated republic, and the other strictly a confederacy&mdash;and taught by the lessons of our own experiment under the <name>Confederation</name>, came together to form a Constitution for <quote>a more perfect union,</quote> and, in my judgment, made the best government which has ever been instituted by man. It only requires that it should be carried out in the spirit in which it was made, that the circumstances under which it was made should continue, and no evil can arise under this Government for which it has not an appropriate remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Then it is outside of the <rs>Government</rs>&mdash;elsewhere than to its Constitution or to its administration&mdash;that we are to look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Men must not creep in the dust of partisan strife and seek to make points against opponents as the means of evading or meeting the issues before us. The fault is not in the form of the <rs>Government</rs>, nor does the evil spring from the manner in which it has been administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Where, then, is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>It is that our fathers formed a Government for a Union of friendly States; and though under it the people have been prosperous beyond comparison with any other whose career is recorded in the history of man, still that Union of friendly States has changed its character, and sectional hostility has been substituted for the fraternity in which the <rs>Government</rs> was founded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>I do not intend here to enter into a statement of grievances; I do not intend here to renew that war of crimination which for years past has disturbed the country, and in which I have taken a part perhaps more zealous than useful; but I call upon all men who have in their hearts a love of the <rs>Union</rs>, and whose service is not merely that of the lip, to look the question calmly but fully in the face, that they may see the true cause of our danger, which, from my examination, I believe to be that a sectional hostility has been substituted for a general fraternity, and thus the <rs>Government</rs> rendered powerless for the ends for which it was instituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The hearts of a portion of the people have been perverted by that hostility, so that the powers delegated by the compact of union are regarded not as means to secure the welfare of all, but as instruments for the destruction of a part&mdash;the minority section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>How, then have we to provide a remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>By strengthening this Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>By instituting physical force to overawe the <name>States</name>, to coerce the people living under them as members of sovereign communities to pass under the yoke of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>No, sir; I would have this Union severed into <num value="33">thirty-three</num> fragments sooner than have that great evil befall constitutional liberty and representative government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Our Government is an agency of delegated and strictly limited powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Its founders did not look to its preservation by force; but the chain they wove to bind these States together was <num value="1">one</num> of love and mutual good offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>They had broken the fetters of despotic power; they had separated themselves from the mother-country upon the question of community independence; and their <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> sons will be degenerate indeed if, clinging to the mere name and forms of free government, they forge and rivet upon their posterity the fetters which their ancestors broke. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>The remedy for these evils is to be found in the patriotism and the affection of the people, if it exists; and, if it does not exist, it is far better, instead of attempting to preserve a forced and therefore fruitless Union, that we should peacefully part and each pursue his separate course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>It is not to this side of the <rs type="place">Chamber</rs> that we should look for propositions; it is not here that we can ask for remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>Complaints, with much amplitude of specification, have gone forth from the members on this side of the <rs type="place">Chamber</rs> heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>It is not to be expected that they will be renewed, for the people have taken the subject into their own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>States, in their sovereign capacity, have now resolved to judge of the infractions of the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, and of the mode and measure of redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>All we can usefully or properly do is to send to the people, thus preparing to act for themselves, evidence of error, if error there be; to transmit to them the proofs of kind feeling, if it actuates the <rs>Northern</rs> section, where they now believe there is only hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>If we are mistaken as to your feelings and purposes, give a substantial proof, that here may begin that circle which hence may spread out and cover the whole land with proofs of fraternity, of a reaction in public sentiment, and the assurance of a future career in conformity with the principles and purposes of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>All else is idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>I would not give the parchment on which the bill would be written that is to secure our constitutional rights within the limits of a State, where the people are all opposed to the execution of that law. It is a truism in free governments that laws rest upon public opinions, and fall powerless before its determined opposition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The time has passed, sir, when appeals might profitably be made to sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The time has come when men must of necessity reason, assemble facts, and deal with current events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>I may be permitted in this to correct an error into which <num value="1">one</num> of my friends fell this morning, when he impressed on us the great value of our Union as measured by the amount of time and money and blood which were spent to form this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>It cost very little time, very little money, and no blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the most peaceful transactions that mark the pages of human history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0008.00055.00147" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:41"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>: The Government is the machinery established by the <rs>Constitution</rs>; it is the agency created by the <name>States</name> when they formed the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Our fathers, I was proceeding to say, having fought the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, and achieved their independence&mdash;each State for itself, each State standing out an integral part, each State separately recognized by the parent Government of Great Britainthese States as independent sovereignties entered into confederate alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>After having tried the <name>Confederation</name> and found it to be a failure, they, of their own accord, came peacefully together, and in a brief period made a Constitution, which was referred to each State and voluntarily ratified by each State that entered the <rs>Union</rs>; little time, little money, and no blood being expended to <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> form this Government, the machine for making the <rs>Union</rs> useful and beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Blood, much and precious, was expended to vindicate and to establish community independence, and the great American idea that all governments rest on the consent of the governed, and that the people may at their will alter or abolish their government, however or by whomsoever instituted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>But our existing Government is not the less sacred to me because it was not sealed with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>I honor it the more because it was the free &mdash; will offering of men who chose to live together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>It rooted in fraternity, and fraternity supported its trunk and all its branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Every bud and leaflet depends entirely on the nurture it receives from fraternity as the root of the tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>When that is destroyed, the trunk decays, and the branches wither, and the leaves fall; and the shade it was designed to give has passed away for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>I cling not merely to the name and form, but to the spirit and purpose of the <rs>Union</rs> which our fathers made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>It was for domestic tranquillity; not to organize within <num value="1">one</num> State lawless bands to commit raids upon another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>It was to provide for the common defense; not to disband armies and navies, lest they should serve the protection of <num value="1">one</num> section of the country better than another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>It was to bring the forces of all the <name>States</name> together to achieve a common object, upholding each the other in amity, and united to repel exterior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>All the custom-house obstructions existing between the <name>States</name> were destroyed; the power to regulate commerce transferred to the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Every barrier to the freest intercourse was swept away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Under the <name>Confederation</name> it had been secured as a right to each citizen to have free transit over all the other States; and under the <rs>Union</rs> it was designed to make this more perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Is it enjoyed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Is it not denied?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Do we not have mere speculative questions of what is property raised in defiance of the clear intent of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, offending as well against its letter as against its whole spirit?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>This must be reformed, or the <rs>Government</rs> our fathers instituted is destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>I say, then, shall we cling to the mere forms or idolize the name of Union, when its blessings are lost, after its spirit has fled?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Who would keep a flower, which had lost its beauty and its fragrance, and in their stead had formed a seed-vessel containing the deadliest poison?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Or, to drop the figure, who would consent to remain in alliance with States which used the power thus acquired to invade his tranquility, to impair his defense, to destroy his peace and security?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Any community would be stronger standing in an isolated position, and using its revenues to maintain its own physical force, than if allied with those who would thus war upon its prosperity and domestic peace; and reason, pride, self-interest, and the apprehension of secret, constant danger would impel to separation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>I do not comprehend the policy of a Southern <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> who would seek to change the whole form of our Government, and substitute Federal force for State obligation and authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Do we want a new Government that is to overthrow the old?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Do we wish to erect a central Colossus, wielding at discretion the military arm, and exercising military force over the people and the <name>States</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>This is not the <rs>Union</rs> to which we were invited; and so carefully was this guarded that, when our fathers provided for using force to put down insurrection, they required that the fact of the insurrection should be communicated by the authorities of the <rs>State</rs> before the <rs>President</rs> could interpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>When it was proposed to give to Congress power to execute the laws against a delinquent State, it was refused <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> on the ground that that would be making war on the <name>States</name>; and, though I know the good purpose of my honorable friend from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> is only to give protection to constitutional rights, I fear his proposition is to rear a monster, which will break the feeble chain provided, and destroy rights it was intended to guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>That military Government which he is about to institute, by passing into hostile hands, becomes a weapon for his destruction, not for his protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>All dangers which we may be called upon to confront as independent communities are light, in my estimation, compared with that which would hang over us if this Federal Government had such physical force; if its character was changed from a representative agent of States to a central Government, with a military power to be used at discretion against the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>To-day it may be the idea that it will be used against some State which nullifies the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws; some State which passes laws to obstruct or repeal the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; some State which, in derogation of our rights of transit under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, passes laws to punish a citizen found there with property recognized by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, but prohibited by the laws of that State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>But how long might it be before that same military force would be turned against the minority section which had sought its protection; and that minority thus become mere subjugated provinces under the great military government that it had thus contributed to establish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The minority, incapable of aggression, is, of necessity, always on the defensive, and often the victim of the desertion of its followers and the faithlessness of its allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>It therefore must maintain, not destroy, barriers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>I do not know that I fully appreciate the purpose of my friend from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>; whether, when he spoke of establishing military posts along the borders of the <name>States</name>, and arming the <rs>Federal Government</rs> with adequate physical power to enforce constitutional rights (I suppose he meant obligations), he meant to confer upon this Federal Government a power which it does not now possess to coerce a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>If he did, then, in the language of <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0008.00057.00148" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, he is providing, not for a <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of States</orgName>, but for the destruction of States; he is providing, under the name of Union, to carry on a war against States; and I care not whether it be against <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> or <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, it is equally objectionable to me; and I will resist it alike in the <num value="1">one</num> case and in the other, as subversive of the great principle on which our Government rests; as a heresy to be confronted at its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> presentation, and put down there, lest it grow into proportions which will render us powerless before it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>The theory of our Constitution, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is <num value="1">one</num> of peace, of equality of sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>It was made by States and made for States; and for greater assurance they passed an amendment, doing that which was necessarily implied by the nature of the instrument, as it was a mere instrument of grants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>But, in the abundance of caution, they declared that everything which had not been delegated was reserved to the <name>States</name>, or to the people&mdash;that is, to the <rs>State</rs> governments as instituted by the people of each State, or to the people in their sovereign capacity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>I need not, then, go on to argue from the history and nature of our Government that no power of coercion exists in it. It is enough for me to demand the clause of the <name>Constituton</name> which confers the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>If it is not there, the <rs>Government</rs> does not possess it. That is the plain construction of the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;made plainer, if possible, by its amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/><pb id="p.58" n="58"/></p> 
<p>This Union is dear to me as a Union of fraternal States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>It would lose its value if I had to regard it as a Union held together by physical force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>I would be happy to know that every State now felt that fraternity which made this Union possible; and, if that evidence could go out, if evidence satisfactory to the people of the <rs>South</rs> could be given that that feeling existed in the hearts of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, you might burn your statute-books and we would cling to the <rs>Union</rs> still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>At the period to which this review of events has advanced, <num value="1">one</num> state had already withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/><num value="7">Seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> others were preparing to follow her example, and others yet were anxiously and doubtfully contemplating the probably impending necessity of taking the same action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>The efforts of Southern men in Congress, aided by the cooperation of the <rs>Northern</rs> friends of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, had failed, by the stubborn refusal of a haughty majority, controlled by <quote>radical purposes,</quote> to yield anything to the spirit of peace and conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>This period, coinciding, as it happens, with the close of a calendar year, affords a convenient point to pause for a brief recapitulation of the causes which had led the <rs>Southern</rs> states into the attitude they then held, and for a more full exposition of the constitutional questions involved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>The reader of many of the treatises on these events, which have been put forth as historical, if dependent upon such alone for information, might naturally enough be led to the conclusion that the controversies which arose between the states, and the war in which they culminated, were caused by efforts on the <num value="1">one</num> side to extend and perpetuate human slavery, and on the other to resist it and establish human liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>The Southern states and Southern people have been sedulously represented as <quote>propagandists</quote> of slavery, and the <rs>Northern</rs> as the defenders and champions of universal freedom, and this view has been so arrogantly assumed, so dogmatically asserted, and so persistently reiterated, that its authors have, in many cases, perhaps, succeeded in bringing themselves to believe it, as well as in impressing it widely upon the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>The attentive reader of the preceding chapters&mdash;especially if he has compared their statements with contemporaneous records and other original sources of information&mdash;will already have found evidence <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> enough to enable him to discern the falsehood of these representations, and to perceive that, to whatever extent the question of slavery may have served as an <hi rend="italics">occasion</hi>, it was far from being the <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> of the conflict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>I have not attempted, and shall not permit myself to be drawn into any discussion of the merits or demerits of slavery as an ethical or even as a political question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>It would be foreign to my purpose, irrelevant to my subject, and would only serve&mdash;as it has invariably served in the hands of its agitators&mdash; to <quote>darken counsel</quote> and divert attention from the genuine issues involved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>As a mere historical fact, we have seen that <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> servitude among us&mdash;confessedly the mildest and most humane of all institutions to which the name <quote>slavery</quote> has ever been applied&mdash;existed in all the original states, and that it was recognized and protected in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Subsequently, for climatic, industrial, and economical&mdash;not moral or sentimental&mdash;reasons, it was abolished in the <rs>Northern</rs>, while it continued to exist in the <rs>Southern</rs> states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Men differed in their views as to the abstract question of its right or wrong, but for <num value="2">two</num> generations after the <name>Revolution</name> there was no geographical line of demarkation for such differences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slave trade was carried on almost exclusively by <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> merchants and Northern ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>It was the offspring of sectional rivalry and political ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>It would have manifested itself just as certainly if slavery had existed in all the states, or if there had not been a negro in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>No such pretension was made in <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs>Louisiana</rs> purchase, and afterward the admission into the <rs>Union</rs> of the state of that name, elicited threats of disunion from the representatives of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>The complaint was not of slavery, but of <quote>the acquisition of more weight at the other extremity</quote> of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>It was not slavery that threatened a rupture in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>, but the unjust and unequal operation of a protective tariff.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>It happened, however, on all these occasions, that the line of demarkation of sectional interests coincided exactly or very nearly with that dividing the states in which negro servitude existed from those in which it had been abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>It corresponded with the prediction of <persName n="Pickering,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0010.00067.00197" reg="nearbymention:Pickering,Timothy,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pickering</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct>, that, in the separation certainly to come, <quote>the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> population would mark the boundary</quote>&mdash;a prediction made without any reference to slavery as a source of dissension.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>Of course the diversity of institutions contributed, in some minor degree, to the conflict of interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>There is an action and reaction of cause and consequence which limits and modifies any general statement of a political truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>I am stating general principles&mdash;not defining modifications and exceptions with the precision of a mathematical proposition or a bill in chancery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>The truth remains intact and incontrovertible, that the existence of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> servitude was in no wise the cause of the conflict, but only an incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>In the later controversies that arose, however, its effect in operating as a lever upon the passions, prejudices, or sympathies of mankind was so potent that it has been spread like a thick cloud over the whole horizon of historic truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>As for the institution of negro servitude, it was a matter entirely subject to the control of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>No power was ever given to the general government to interfere with it, but an obligation was imposed to protect it. Its existence and validity were distinctly recognized by the <rs>Constitution</rs> in at least <num value="3">three</num> places:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, in that part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">second section</orgName> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article which prescribes that <quote>representatives and direct taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective members, which shall be determined by adding to the whole number of free persons, including those bound to service for a term of years, and, excluding Indians not taxed, <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of all other <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> persons.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/><quote>Other persons</quote> than <quote>free persons</quote> and those <quote>bound to service for a term of years</quote> must, of course, have meant those permanently bound to service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Secondly, it was recognized by the <orgName type="regiment" key="9Section">ninth section</orgName> of the same article, which provided that <quote>the migration or importation of such persons as any of the <name>States</name> now existing shall think proper to admit shall not be prohibited by Congress prior to the year <dateStruct value="1808"><year reg="1808">one thousand eight hundred and eight</year></dateStruct>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>This was a provision inserted for the protection of the interests of the slave-trading <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> states, forbidding any prohibition of the trade by Congress for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, and thus virtually giving sanction to the legitimacy of the demand which that trade was prosecuted to supply, and which was its only object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Again, and in the third place, it was specially recognized, and an obligation imposed upon every state, not only to refrain from interfering with it in any other state, but in certain cases to aid in its enforcement, by that clause, or paragraph, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">second section</orgName> of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article which provides as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>No person held to service or labor in <num value="1">one</num> State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>It is easy to understand how those who considered them in conflict with the <quote>higher law</quote> of religion or morality might refuse to take such an oath or hold such an office&mdash;as the members of some religious sects refuse to take any oath at all or to bear arms in the service of their country&mdash;but it is impossible to reconcile with the obligations of honor or honesty the conduct of those who, having taken such an oath, made use of the powers and opportunities of the offices held under its sanctions to nullify its obligations and neutralize its guarantees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>The halls of Congress afforded the vantage ground from which assaults were made upon these guarantees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The legislatures of various Northern states enacted laws to hinder the execution of the provisions made for the rendition of fugitives from service; state officials lent their aid to the work of thwarting them; city mobs assailed the officers engaged in the duty of enforcing them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>This question, as we have seen, had already been the subject of long and energetic discussion, without any satisfactory conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>But this change had not been produced by any change of opinion in relation to this race, but because it was discovered from experience that slave-labor was unsuited to the climate and productions of these States; for some of these States, when it had ceased, or nearly ceased, to exist, were actively engaged in the slave-trade; procuring cargoes on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, and transporting them for sale to those parts of the <rs>Union</rs> where their labor was found to be profitable and suited to the climate and productions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>During this period the general government was vested in the <rs>Congress</rs> alone, in which each state, through its representatives, had an equal vote in the determination of all questions whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>These exigencies led to a proposition for a meeting of commissioners from the various states to consider the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>As they expressed it, it was their <quote>unanimous conviction that it may essentially tend to advance the interests of the <rs>Union</rs>, if the states, by whom they have been respectively delegated, would themselves concur, and use their endeavors to procure the concurrence of the other states, in the appointment of commissioners, to meet at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Monday in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> next, to take into consideration the situation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to devise such further provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> adequate to the exigencies of the <rs>Union</rs>, and to report such an act for that purpose to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in Congress assembled, as, when agreed to by them, and afterward confirmed by the <name>Legislatures</name> of every State, will effectually provide for the same.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>From an examination and comparison of the enactments and instructions above quoted, we may derive certain conclusions, so obvious that they need only to be stated:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/><num value="1">1</num>. In the first place, it is clear that the delegates to the convention of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> represented, not <hi rend="italics">the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi> in mass, as has been most absurdly contended by some political writers, but <hi rend="italics">the people</hi> of the several states, <hi rend="italics">as states&mdash;just</hi> as in the <rs>Congress</rs> of that period&mdash; <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, with her <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> inhabitants, having entire equality with <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, which had more than <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num>, or <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, with her <num value="750000">seven hundred and fifty thousand</num>. <pb id="p.81" n="81"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/><num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>No validity could attach to any action taken, unless and until it should be afterward ratified by the several states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation the general government was obliged to rely upon the governments of the several states for the execution of its enactments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Except its own officers and employees, and in time of war the federal army and navy, it could exercise no control upon individual citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>With regard to the states, no compulsory or coercive measures could be employed to enforce its authority, in case of opposition or indifference to its exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>This last was a feature of the confederation which it was not desirable nor possible to change, and no objection was made to it; it was generally admitted, however, that some machinery should be devised to enable the general government to exercise its legitimate functions by means of a mandatory authority operating directly upon the individual citizens within the limits of its constitutional powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>The necessity for such provision was undisputed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Beyond the common ground of a recognition of this necessity, there was a wide diversity of opinion among the members of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/><num value="1">One</num> party, whose object and wish it was to abolish and annihilate all State governments, and to bring forward <num value="1">one</num> General Government over this extensive continent of a monarchical nature, under certain restrictions and limitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Those who openly avowed this sentiment were, it is true, but few; yet it is equally true that there was a considerable number, who did not openly avow it, who were, by myself and many others of the <rs>Convention</rs>, considered as being in reality favorers of that sentiment. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> party was not for the abolition of the <rs>State</rs> governments nor for the <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> introduction of a monarchical government under any form; but they wished to establish such a system as could give their own States undue power and influence in the government over the other States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party was what I considered truly federal and republican.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>This party was nearly equal in number with the other <num value="2">two</num>, and was composed of the delegates from <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, New York, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, and in part from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>; also of some individuals from other representations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>This party were for proceeding upon terms of federal equality: they were for taking our present federal system as the basis of their proceedings, and, as far as experience had shown that other powers were necessary to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, to give those powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>They considered this the object for which they were sent by their States, and what their States expected from them.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>In his account of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> party above described <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n0125.0012.00083.00209" reg="nearbymention:Martin,Luther,,,"><surname>Martin</surname></persName> refers to those representatives of the larger states who wished to establish a numerical basis of representation in the <rs>Congress</rs>, instead of the equal representation of the states (whether large or small) which existed under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>There was naturally much dissatisfaction on the part of the greater states&mdash;<placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>&mdash;whose population at that period exceeded that of all the others combined, but which, in the <rs>Congress</rs>, constituted less than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the voting strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>On the other hand, the smaller states were tenacious of their equality in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>Of the very smallest, <num value="1">one</num>, as we have seen, had sent no representatives to the convention, and the other had instructed her delegates, unconditionally, to insist upon the maintenance of absolute equality in the <rs>Congress</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>This difference gave more trouble than any other question that came before the convention, and for some time threatened to prove irreconcilable and to hinder any final agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>It was ultimately settled by a compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Provision was made for the representation of the people of the states in <num value="1">one</num> branch of the <orgName n="Federal Legislature" type="legislature">federal legislature</orgName> (the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>) in proportion to their numbers; in the other branch (the <name>Senate</name>), for the equal representation of the states as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The perpetuity of this equality was furthermore guaranteed by a stipulation that no state should ever be deprived of its equal suffrage in the <name>Senate</name> without its own consent.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>This motion was agreed to without opposition, and, as a consequence, the word <quote>national</quote> was stricken out wherever it occurred, and nowhere makes its appearance in the <rs>Constitution</rs> finally adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>The prompt rejection, after introduction, of this word <quote>national,</quote> is obviously much more expressive of the intent and purpose of the authors of the <rs>Constitution</rs> than its mere absence from the <rs>Constitution</rs> would have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>It is a clear indication that they did not mean to give any countenance to the idea which, <quote>scotched, not killed,</quote> has again reared its mischievous crest in these latter days&mdash;that the government which they organized was a consolidated nationality, instead of a confederacy of sovereign members.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Continuing their great work of revision and reorganization, the convention proceeded to construct the framework of a government for the confederacy, strictly confined to certain specified and limited powers, but complete in all its parts, legislative, executive, and judicial, and provided <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> with the means for discharging all its functions without interfering with the <quote>sovereignty, freedom, and independence</quote> of the constituent states.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>All this might have been done without going beyond the limits of their commission <quote>to revise the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation,</quote> and to consider and report such <quote>alterations and provisions</quote> as might seem necessary to <quote>render the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>A serious difficulty, however, was foreseen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>The <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num> and last of the aforesaid articles had this provision, which has already been referred to: <quote>The Articles of this Confederation <hi rend="italics">shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the union shall be perpetuated; nor shall any alteration, at any time hereafter, be made in any of them</hi>, unless such alteration be agreed to in a <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, and be afterward confirmed by the <name>Legislatures</name> of <hi rend="italics">every State</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/></p> 
<p>It is obvious, from an examination of the records, as has already been shown, that the original idea in calling a convention was that their recommendations should take the course prescribed by this article&mdash;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, a report to the <rs>Congress</rs>, and then, if approved by that body, a submission to the various legislatures for final action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>There was no reason to apprehend the nonconcurrence of Congress, in which a mere majority would determine the question; but the consent of the legislatures of <quote>every State</quote> was requisite in order to final ratification, and there was serious reason to fear that this consent could not be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/><placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, as we have seen, had declined to send any representatives to the convention; of the <num value="3">three</num> delegates from New York, <num value="2">two</num> had withdrawn; other indications of dissatisfaction had appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>In case of the failure of a single legislature to ratify, the labors of the convention would go for naught, under a strict adherence to the letter of the article above cited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The danger of a total frustration of their efforts was imminent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>In this emergency the convention took the responsibility of transcending the limits of their instructions, and recommending a procedure which was in direct contravention of the letter of the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>This was the introduction of a provision into the new Constitution, that the ratification of <num value="9">nine</num> States should be sufficient for its establishment among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>In order to validate this provision, it was necessary to refer it to authority higher than that of Congress and the state legislatures&mdash;that is, to the <hi rend="italics">people</hi> of the states, assembled by their representatives in convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Hence it was provided, by the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> and last article of the new Constitution, that <quote>the ratification of the <hi rend="italics">Conventions</hi> of <num value="9">nine</num> States</quote> should suffice for its establishment <quote>between the <name>States</name> so ratifying the same.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/><pb id="p.86" n="86"/></p> 
<p>There was another reason, of a more general and perhaps more controlling character, for this reference to conventions for ratification, even if entire unanimity of the state legislatures could have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Under the <rs>American</rs> theory of republican government, conventions of the people, duly elected and accredited as such, are invested with the plenary power inherent in the people of an organized and independent community, assembled in mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>In other words, they represent and exercise what is properly the sovereignty of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>State legislatures, with restricted powers, do not possess or represent sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Still less does the <rs>Congress</rs> of a union or confederacy of states, which is by <num value="2">two</num> degrees removed from the seat of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>We sometimes read or hear of <quote>delegated sovereignty,</quote> <quote>divided sovereignty,</quote> with other loose expressions of the same sort; no such thing as a division or delegation of sovereignty is possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>In order, therefore, to supersede the restraining article above cited and to give the highest validity to the compact for the delegation of important powers and functions of government to a common agent, an authoity above that of the state legislatures was necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>This objection would of course have applied with greater force to the proposed Constitution, which provided for additional grants of power from the states, and the conferring of larger and more varied powers upon a general government, which was to act upon individuals instead of states, if the question of its confirmation had been submitted merely to the several state legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>Hence the obvious propriety of referring it to the respective <hi rend="italics">people</hi> of the states in their sovereign capacity, as provided in the final article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>In this article provision was deliberately made for the secession (if necessary) of a part of the states from a union which, when formed, had been declared <quote>perpetual,</quote> and its terms and articles to be <quote>inviolably observed by every State.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/></p> 
<p>Opposition was made to the provision on this very ground&mdash;that it was virtually a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, and that it would furnish a precedent for future secessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>He answers this question <quote>by recurring to the absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of self-preservation; to the transcendent law of nature and of nature's <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which declares that the safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrifiecd.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>He proceeds, however, to give other grounds of justification: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>It is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach of any <num value="1">one</num> article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a breach committed by either of the parties absolves the others, and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact violated and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the consent of particular States to a dissolution of the <rs>Federal</rs> pact, will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to answer the multiplied and important infractions with which they may be confronted?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/><placeName reg="Madison, Dane, Wisconsin" key="tgn,7013966">Madison</placeName>'s idea of the propriety of <hi rend="italics">veiling</hi> any statement of the right of secession until the occasion arises for its exercise, whether right or wrong in itself, is eminently suggestive as explanatory of the caution exhibited by other statesmen of that period, as well as himself, with regard to that <quote>delicate truth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/></p> 
<p>The only possible alternative to the view here taken of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as a provision for the secession of any <num value="9">nine</num> states, which might think proper to avail themselves of it, from union with such as should refuse to do so, and the formation of an amended or <quote>more perfect union</quote> with <num value="1">one</num> another, is to regard it as a provision for the continuance of the old Union, or Confederation, under altered conditions, by the majority which should accede to them, with a recognition of the right of the recusant minority to withdraw, secede, or stand aloof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The idea of compelling any state or states to enter into or to continue in union with the others by <hi rend="italics">coercion</hi>, is as absolutely excluded under the <num value="1">one</num> supposition as under the other&mdash;with reference to <num value="1">one</num> state or a minority of states, as well as with regard to a majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>The article declares that <quote>the ratification of the <name>Conventions</name> of <num value="9">nine</num> States shall be sufficient for the establishment of this Constitution</quote>&mdash;not between all, <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> but&mdash;<hi rend="italics"><quote>between the <name>States</name> so ratifying the same.</quote></hi> It is submitted whether a fuller justification of this right of the <num value="9">nine</num> states to form a new government is not found in the fact of the sovereignty in each of them, making them <quote>a law unto themselves,</quote> and therefore the final judge of what the necessities of each community demand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Here&mdash;although, perhaps, in advance of its proper place in the argument&mdash;the attention of the reader may be directed to the refutation, afforded by this article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, of that astonishing fiction which has been put forward by some distinguished writers of later date, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was established by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <quote>in the aggregate.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>If such had been the case, the will of a majority, duly ascertained and expressed, would have been binding upon the minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>No such idea existed in its formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>It was not even established by the <hi rend="italics">states in the aggregate</hi>, nor was it proposed that it should be. It was submitted for the acceptance of each separately, the time and place at their own option, so that the dates of ratification did extend from <dateStruct value="1787-12-07"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="7">7</day>, <year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>, to <dateStruct value="1790-05-29"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="29">29</day>, <year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>The long period required for these ratifications makes manifest the absurdity of the assertion, that it was a decision by the votes of <num value="1">one</num> people, or <num value="1">one</num> community, in which a majority of the votes cast determined the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>We have seen that the delegates to the convention of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> were chosen by the several states, <hi rend="italics">as states&mdash;</hi> it is hardly necessary to add that they voted in the convention, as in the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">federal Congress</orgName>, by states&mdash;each state casting <num value="1">one</num> vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>We have seen, also, that they were sent for the <quote>sole and express purpose</quote> of revising the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation and devising means for rendering the federal Constitution <quote>adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs></quote>; that the terms <quote>Union,</quote> <quote><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</quote> <quote>Federal Constitution,</quote> and <quote>Constitution of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>,</quote> were applied to the old confederation in precisely the same sense in which they are used under the new; that the proposition to constitute a <quote>national</quote> government was distinctly rejected by the convention; that the right of any state, or states, to withdraw from union with the others was practically exemplified, and that the idea of coercion of a state, or compulsory measures, was distinctly excluded under any construction that can be put upon the action of the convention.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>It was ultimately adopted by a very close vote (<num value="187">187</num> to <num value="168">168</num>), and then only as accompanied by certain proposed amendments, the object of which was to guard more expressly against any sacrifice or <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> compromise of state sovereignty, and under an assurance, given by the advocates of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, of the certainty that those amendments would be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>The most strenuously urged of these was that ultimately adopted (in substance) as the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which was intended to take the place of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Article of Confederation, as an emphatic assertion of the continued freedom, sovereignty, and independence of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>If it has any significance now, it must have had the same under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, or even before they were adopted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>It has been fully shown that the states which thus became and continued to be <quote>united,</quote> whatever form their union assumed, acted and continued to act as distinct and sovereign political communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>The monstrous fiction that they acted as <num value="1">one</num> people <quote>in their aggregate capacity</quote> has not an atom of fact to serve as a basis.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>He says: <quote>Now, it is apparent that none of the colonies before the <name>Revolution</name> were, in the most large and general sense, independent or sovereign communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>They were all originally settled under and subjected to the <rs>British Crown</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>And then he proceeds to show that they were, in their <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> colonial condition, not sovereign&mdash;a proposition which nobody disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>As colonies, they had no claim, and made no pretension, to sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>They were subject to the <rs>British Crown</rs>, unless, like the <rs>Plymouth</rs> colony, <quote>a law unto themselves,</quote> but they were independent of each other&mdash;the only point which has any bearing upon their subsequent relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>There was no other bond between them than that of their common allegiance to the government of the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>As an illustration of this may be cited the historical fact that when <persName n="Stark,,John,,," id="n0125.0014.00099.00237" reg="default:Stark,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Stark</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7013382" n="1.000 35" reg="bennington, bennington, vermont">Bennington</placeName> memory, was before the <name>Revolution</name> engaged in a hunting expedition in the <rs>Indian</rs> country, he was captured by the savages and brought to <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, in the colony of New York, for a ransom; inasmuch as he belonged to <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, however, the government of New York took no action for his release.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>There was not even enough community of feeling to induce individual citizens to provide money for the purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>There were, however, local and partial confederacies among the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> colonies, long before the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Much has been said of the <quote>prohibition</quote> of the exercise by the states of certain functions of sovereignty, such as making treaties, declaring war, coining money, etc. This is only a part of the general compact, by which the contracting parties covenant, <num value="1">one</num> with another, to abstain from the separate exercise of certain powers, which they agree to entrust to the management and control of the union or general agency of the parties associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>It is not a prohibition imposed upon them from without, or from above, by any external or superior power, but is self-imposed by their free consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>The case is strictly analogous to that of individuals forming a mercantile or manufacturing copartnership, who voluntarily agree to refrain, as individuals, from engaging in other pursuits or speculations, from lending their individual credit, or from the exercise of any other right of a citizen, which they may think proper to subject to the consent, or entrust to the management of the firm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>The prohibitory clauses of the <rs>Constitution</rs> referred to are not at all a denial of the full sovereignty of the states, but are merely an agreement among them to exercise certain powers of sovereignty in concert, and not separately and apart.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>This enunciation of a principle, which, even if it had not been expressly declared, would have been a necessary deduction from the acceptance of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, has been magnified and perverted into a meaning and purpose entirely foreign to that which plain interpretation is sufficient to discern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Usurpations of power by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, there may have been, and may be again, but there has never been either a <orgName n="Sovereign Convention" type="convention">sovereign convention</orgName> or a direct vote of the <quote>whole people</quote> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to demonstrate its existence as a corporate unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>Every exercise of sovereignty by any of the people of this country that has actually taken place has been by the people of states <hi rend="italics">as states</hi>. In the face of this fact, is it not the merest self-stultification to admit the sovereignty of the people and deny it to the states, in which alone they have community existence?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>This subject is <num value="1">one</num> of such vital importance to a right understanding <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> of the events which this work is designed to record and explain that it can not be dismissed without an effort in the way of recapitulation and conclusion, to make it clear beyond the possibility of misconception.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>According to the <rs>American</rs> theory, every individual is endowed with certain unalienable rights, among which are <quote>life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>He is entitled to all the freedom, in these and in other respects, that is consistent with the safety and the rights of others and the weal of the community, but political sovereignty, which is the source and origin of all the powers of government&mdash;legislative, executive, and judicial&mdash;belongs to, and inheres in, the people of an organized political community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>It is an attribute of the whole people of such a community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>It includes the power and necessarily the duty of protecting the rights and redressing the wrongs of individuals, of punishing crimes, enforcing contracts, prescribing rules for the transfer of property and the succession of estates, making treaties with foreign powers, leving taxes, etc. The enumeration of particulars might be extended, but these will suffice as illustrations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>These powers are of course exercised through the agency of governments, but the governments are <hi rend="italics">only</hi> agents of the sovereign&mdash;responsible to it, and subject to its control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>This sovereign&mdash;the people, in the aggregate, of each political community&mdash;delegates to the government the exercise of such powers, or functions, as it thinks proper, but in an American republic never transfers or surrenders sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>That remains, unalienated and unimpaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>It is by virtue of this sovereignty alone that the <rs>Government</rs>, its authorized agent, commands the obedience of the individual citizen, to the extent of its derivative, dependent, and delegated authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>The <hi rend="italics">allegiance</hi> of the citizen is due to the sovereign alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>Thus far, I think, all will agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>No American statesman or publist would venture to dispute it. Notwithstanding the inconsiderate or ill-considered expressions thrown out by some persons about the unity of the <rs>American</rs> people from the beginning, no respectable authority has ever had the hardihood to deny that, before the adoption of the federal Constitution, the only sovereign political community was the people of the state&mdash;the people of <hi rend="italics">each state</hi>. The ordinary exercise of what are generally termed the powers of sovereignty was by and through their respective governments; when they formed a confederation, a portion of those powers was entrusted to the general government, or agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>Under the confederation, the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> represented the collective power of the states; still, the people of each state alone <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> possessed sovereignty, and consequently were entitled to the allegiance of the citizen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>When the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation were amended, when the new Constitution was substituted in their place and the general government reorganized, its structure was changed, additional powers were conferred upon it, and thereby subtracted from the powers theretofore exercised by the state governments; the seat of sovereignty&mdash;the source of all those delegated and dependent powers&mdash;was not disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>There was a new government or an amended government&mdash;it is entirely immaterial in which of these lights we consider it&mdash;but no new <hi rend="italics">people</hi> was created or constituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>The people, in whom alone sovereignty inheres, remained just as they had been before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>The only change was in the form, structure, and relations of their governmental agencies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>No doubt the states&mdash;the people of the states&mdash;if they had been so disposed, might have merged themselves into <num value="1">one</num> great consolidated state, retaining their geographical boundaries merely as matters of convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>But such a merger must have been distinctly and formally stated, not left to deduction or implication.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>Men do not alienate even an estate, without positive and express terms and stipulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>But in this case not only was there no express transfer&mdash;no formal surrender&mdash;of the preexisting sovereignty, but it was expressly provided that nothing should be understood as even delegated&mdash;that everything was reserved, unless granted in express terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>The monstrous conception of the creation of a new people, invested with the whole or a great part of the sovereignty which had previously belonged to the people of each state, has not a syllable to sustain it in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but is built up entirely upon the palpable misconstruction of a single expression in the preamble.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>In denying that there is any such collective unit as the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate, of course I am not to be understood as denying that there is such a political organization as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or that there exists, with large and distinct powers, a government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but it is claimed that the <rs>Union</rs>, as its name implies, is constituted of states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>The only difference is that, in the creation of the state governments, each sovereign acted alone; in that of the federal government, they acted in cooperation with the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>Neither the whole nor any part of their sovereignty has been surrendered to either government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>To whom, in fine, could the states have surrendered their sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>Not to the mass of the people inhabiting the territory possessed by all the states, for there was no such community in existence, and they took no measures for the organization of such a community.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Looking back for a moment at the ground over which we have gone, I think it may be fairly asserted that the following propositions have been clearly and fully established:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/><num value="1">1</num>. That the states of which the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American union</orgName> was formed, from the moment when they emerged from their colonial or provincial condition, became severally sovereign, free, and independent states&mdash;not <num value="1">one</num> state, or nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/><num value="2">2</num>. That the union formed under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation was a compact between the states, in which these attributes of <quote>sovereignty, freedom, and independence</quote> were expressly asserted and guaranteed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/><num value="3">3</num>. That, in forming the <quote>more perfect union</quote> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, afterward adopted, the same contracting powers formed an <hi rend="italics">amended compact</hi>, without any surrender of these attributes of sovereignty, freedom, and independence, either expressed or implied: on the contrary, that by the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, limiting the power of the government to its express grants, they distinctly guarded against the presumption of a surrender of anything by implication.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/><num value="4">4</num>. That political sovereignty resides neither in individual citizens, nor in unorganized masses, nor in fractional subdivisions of a community, but in the people of an organized political body.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/><num value="5">5</num>. That no <quote>republican form of government,</quote> in the sense in which that expression is used in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and was generally understood by the founders of the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;whether it be the government of a state or of a confederation of states&mdash;is possessed of any sovereignty whatever, but merely exercises certain powers delegated by the sovereign authority of the people, and subject to recall and reassumption by the same authority that conferred them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/><num value="6">6</num>. That the <quote>people</quote> who organized the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> confederation, the people who dissolved it, the people who ordained and established the <rs>Constitution</rs> which succeeded it, the only people, in fine, known or referred to in the phraseology of that period&mdash;whether the term was used collectively or distributively&mdash;were the people of the respective states, <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> each acting separately and with absolute independence of the others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/><num value="7">7</num>. That, in forming and adopting the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the states, or the people of the states&mdash;terms which, when used with reference to acts performed in a sovereign capacity, are precisely equivalent to each other &mdash;formed a new <hi rend="italics">government</hi>, but no new <hi rend="italics">people;</hi> that, consequently, no new sovereignty was created&mdash;for sovereignty in an American republic can belong only to a people, never to a government&mdash;and that the federal government is entitled to exercise only the powers delegated to it by the people of the respective states.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/><num value="8">8</num>. That the term <quote>people,</quote> in the preamble to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and in the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> amendment, is used distributively; that the only <quote>people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></quote> known to the <rs>Constitution</rs> are the people of each state in the <rs>Union</rs>; that no such political community or corporate unit as <num value="1">one</num> people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> then existed, has ever been organized, or yet exists; that no political action by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate has ever taken place, or ever can take place, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>The fictitious idea of <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, contradicted in the last paragraph, has been so impressed upon the popular mind by false teaching, by careless and vicious phraseology, and by the ever-present spectacle of a great government, with its army and navy, its customhouses and post offices, its multitude of officeholders, and the splendid prizes which it offers to political ambition, that the tearing away of these illusions and presentation of the original fabric, which they have overgrown and hidden from view, have no doubt been unwelcome, distasteful, and even repellent to some of my readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>The artificial splendor which makes the deception attractive is even employed as an argument to prove its reality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>The glitter of the powers delegated to the agent serves to obscure the perception of the sovereign power of the principal by whom they are conferred, as, by the unpracticed eye, the showy costume and conspicuous functions of the <rs type="role" reg="drum-Major">drum major</rs> are mistaken for emblems of chieftaincy&mdash; while the misuse or ambiguous use of the term <quote>union</quote> and its congeners contributes to increase the confusion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>So much the more need for insisting upon the elementary truths which have been obscured by these specious sophistries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>The reader really desirous of ascertaining truth is, therefore, again cautioned against confounding <num value="2">two</num> ideas so essentially distinct as that of <hi rend="italics">government</hi>, which is derivative, dependent, and subordinate, with that of the <hi rend="italics">people</hi>, as an organized political community, which is sovereign, without any other <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> than self-imposed limitations, and such as proceed from the general principles of the personal rights of man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>It has been said in a foregoing chapter that the authors of the <rs>Constitution</rs> could scarcely have anticipated the idea of such a community as the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <num value="1">one</num> mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>Perhaps this expression needs some little qualification, for there is rarely a fallacy, however stupendous, that is wholly original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>A careful examination of the records of the convention of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> exhibits <num value="1">one</num> or perhaps <num value="2">two</num> instances of such a suggestion&mdash;both by the same person&mdash;and the result in each case is strikingly significant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>The original proposition made concerning the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs></orgName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> contemplated his election by the <rs>Congress</rs>, or, as it was termed by the proposer, <quote>the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">national Legislature</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, this proposition being under consideration, <persName n="Morris,,Gouverneur,,," id="n0125.0020.00135.00351" reg="default:Morris,Gouverneur,,,"><foreName>Gouverneur</foreName> <surname>Morris</surname></persName> moved that the words <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">national Legislature</orgName> be stricken out, and <quote>citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></quote> inserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>The proposition was supported by <persName n="Wilson,,James,,," id="n0125.0020.00135.00352" reg="default:Wilson,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>&mdash;both of these gentlemen being delegates from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and both among the most earnest advocates of centralism in the convention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>Now, it is not at all certain that <persName n="Morris,,,,," id="n0125.0020.00135.00353" reg="nearbymention:Morris,Gouverneur,,,"><surname>Morris</surname></persName> had in view an election by the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <quote>in the aggregate,</quote> voting as <num value="1">one</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>The language of his proposition is entirely consistent with the idea of an election by the citizens of each state, voting separately and independently, though it is ambiguous, and may admit of the other construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>It failed for want of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and does not even appear in the official journal of the convention.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>The extracts which have been given, in treating of special branches of the subject, from the writings and speeches of the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and other statesmen of that period, afford ample proof of their entire and almost unanimous accord with the principles which have been established on the authority of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, the acts of ratification by the several states, and other attestations of the highest authority and validity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>I am well aware that isolated expressions may be found in the reports of debates on the general and state conventions and other public bodies, indicating the existence of individual opinions seemingly inconsistent with these principles; that loose and confused ideas were sometimes expressed with regard to sovereignty, the relations between governments and people, and kindred subjects; that, while the plan of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was under discussion, and before it was definitely reduced to its present shape, there were earnest advocates in the convention of a more consolidated system, with a stronger central government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>But these expressions of individual opinion only prove the existence of a small minority of dissentients from the principles generally entertained, and which finally prevailed in the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>The formation of a <quote>more perfect union</quote> was accomplished by the organization of a government more complete in its various branches, legislative, executive, and judicial, and by the delegation to this government of certain additional powers of functions which had previously been exercised by the governments of the respective states&mdash;especially in providing the means of operating directly upon individuals for the enforcement of its legitimately delegated authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>There was no abandonment nor modification of the essential principle of a compact between sovereigns, which applied to the <num value="1">one</num> case as fully as to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>There was not the slightest intimation of so radical a revolution as the surrender of the sovereignty of the contracting parties would have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>The additional powers conferred upon the federal government by the <rs>Constitution</rs> were merely transfers of some of those possessed by the state governments&mdash;not subtractions from the reserved and inalienable sovereignty of the political communities which conferred them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>It was an amended Union, not a consolidation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>It is a remarkable fact that the very powers of the federal government and prohibitions to the states, which are most relied upon by the advocates of centralism as incompatible with state sovereignty, were in force under the old confederation when the sovereignty of the states was expressly recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The general government had then, as now, the exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war, making treaties and alliances, maintaining an army and navy, granting letters of <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> marque and reprisal, regulating coinage, establishing and controlling the postal service&mdash;indeed, nearly all the so-called <quote>characteristic powers of sovereignty</quote> exercised by the federal government under the existing Constitution, except the regulation of commerce, and of levying and collecting its revenues directly, instead of through the interposition of the state authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>The exercise of these <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named powers was prohibited to the states under the old compact, <quote>without the consent of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in Congress assembled,</quote> but no <num value="1">one</num> has claimed that the confederation had thereby acquired sovereignty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>The present Union owes its very existence to the dissolution, by separate secession of its members, of the former Union, which, as we have thus seen, as to its organic principles, rested upon precisely the same foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>The right to withdraw from the association results, in either case, from the same principles&mdash;principles which, I think, have been established on an impregnable basis of history, reason, law, and precedent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>It is not contended that this right should be resorted to for insufficient cause, or, as the writer already quoted on the law of partnership says, <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> <quote>wantonly and injuriously to the other partners,</quote> without responsibility of the seceding party for any damage thus done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>No association can be dissolved without a likelihood of the occurrence of incidental questions concerning common property and mutual obligations&mdash;questions sometimes of a complex and intricate sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>If a wrong be perpetrated, in such case, it is a matter for determination by the means usually employed among independent and sovereign powers&mdash;negotiating, arbitration, or, in the failure of these, by war, with which unfortunately, Christianity and civilization have not yet been able entirely to dispense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>But the suggestion of possible evils does not at all affect the question of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>There is no great principle in the affairs either of individuals or of nations that is not liable to such difficulties in its practical application.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>We have seen how very untenable is the assertion that the states are not named in it, and how much pertinency or significance in the omission of the word <quote>sovereignty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>The pertinent question that occurs is, Why was so obvious an attribute of sovereignty not expressly renounced if it was intended to surrender it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>It certainly existed; it was not surrendered; therefore it still exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>This would be a more natural and rational conclusion than that it has ceased to exist because it is not mentioned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>The simple truth is that it would have been a very extraordinary thing to incorporate into the <rs>Constitution</rs> any express provision for the secession of the states and dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>Its founders undoubtedly desired and hoped that it would be perpetual; against the proposition for power to coerce a state, the argument was that it would be a means, not of preserving, but of destroying the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>It was not for them to make arrangements for its termination&mdash;a calamity which there was no occasion to provide for in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>Sufficient for their day was the evil thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>It is not usual, either in partnerships between men or in treaties between governments, to make provision for a dissolution of the partnership or a termination of the treaty, unless there be some special reason for a limitation of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Indeed, in treaties, the usual formula includes a declaration of their perpetuity; but in either case the power of the contracting parties, or of any of them, to dissolve the compact, on terms not damaging to the rights of the other parties, is not the less clearly understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>It was not necessary in the <rs>Constitution</rs> to <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> affirm the right of secession, because it was an attribute of sovereignty, and the states had reserved all which they had not delegated.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>Finally, the absurdity of the construction attempted to be put upon these expressions will be evident from a very brief analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>As no danger could have been apprehended from either of these, it must have been against the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that the provision was made; that is to say, the whole people of a republic make this declaration against a government established by themselves and entirely subject to their own control, under a constitution <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> which contains provisions for its own amendment by this very same <quote>whole people,</quote> whenever they may think proper!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>Is it not a libel upon the statesmen of that generation to attribute to their grave and solemn declarations a meaning so vapid and absurd?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>To those who argue that the grants of the <rs>Constitution</rs> are fatal to the reservation of sovereignty by the states, the <rs>Constitution</rs> furnishes a conclusive answer in the amendment which was coeval with the adoption of the instrument, and which declares that all powers not delegated to the government of the <rs>Union</rs> were reserved to the states or to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>As sovereignty was not delegated by the states, it was necessarily reserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>It would be superfluous to answer arguments against implied powers of the states; none are claimed by implication, because all not delegated by the states remained with them, and it was only in an abundance of caution that they expressed the right to resume such parts of their unlimited power as was delegated for the purpose enumerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>As these be those who see danger to the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs> in the possession of such power by the states, and insist that our fathers did not intend to bind the states together by a compact no better than <quote>a rope of sand,</quote> it may be well to examine their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>From what have dangers to the <rs>Union</rs> arisen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>Have they sprung from too great restriction on the exercise of the granted powers, or from the assumption by the general government of power claimed by implication?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>The whole record of our Union answers, from the latter only.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>Was this tendency to usurpation caused by the presumption of paramount authority in the general government, or by the assertion of the right of a state to resume the powers it had delegated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Reasonably and honestly it cannot be assigned to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>Let it be supposed that the <quote>whole people</quote> had recognized the right of a state of the <rs>Union</rs>, peaceably and independently, to resume the powers which, peaceably and independently, she had delegated to the federal government, would not this have been potent to restrain the general government from exercising its functions to the injury and oppression of such state?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>To deny that effect would be to suppose that a dominant majority would be willing to drive a state from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Would the admission of the right of a state to resume the grants it had made, have led to the exercise of that right for light and trivial causes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>It will require but few words to dispose of some superficial objections that have been made to the application of this doctrine in a special case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>It is sometimes said that, whatever weight may attach to principles founded on the sovereignty and independence of the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> states, they cannot apply to the states of more recent origin&mdash;constituting now a majority of the members of the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;because these are but the offspring of creatures of the <rs>Union</rs>, and must of course be subordinate and dependent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>This objection would scarcely occur to any instructed mind, though it may possess a certain degree of specious plausibility for the untaught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>It is enough to answer that the entire equality of the states, in every particular, is a vital condition of their union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>Every new member that has been admitted into the partnership of states came in, as is expressly declared in the acts for their admission, on a footing of perfect equality in every respect with the original members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>This equality is as complete as the equality, before the laws, of the son with the father, immediately on the attainment by the former of his legal majority, without regard to the prior condition of dependence and tutelage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>The relations of the original states to <num value="1">one</num> another and to the <rs>Union</rs> cannot be affected by any subsequent accessions of new members, as the <rs>Constitution</rs> fixes those relations permanently, and furnishes the normal standard which is applicable to all. <placeName reg="The Boston">The Boston</placeName> memorial to Congress, referred to in a foregoing chapter, as prepared by a committee with <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0125.0022.00153.00417" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> at its head, says that the new states <quote>are universally considered as admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> upon the same footing as the original States, and as possessing, in respect to the <rs>Union</rs>, the same rights of <hi rend="italics">sovereignty, freedom, and independence</hi>, as the other States.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/></p> 
<p>But, with regard to states formed of territory acquired by purchase from <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, it is claimed that, as they were bought <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, they belong to the same, and have no right to withdraw at will from an association the property which had been purchased by the other parties.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>Indeed, the denial of the right would be inconsistent with the character of American political institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>Another objection made to the right of secession is based upon obscure, indefinite, and inconsistent ideas with regard to allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>It assumes various shapes, and is therefore somewhat difficult to meet, but, as most frequently presented, may be stated thus: that the citizen owes a double allegiance, or a divided allegiance&mdash;partly to his state, partly to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; that it is not possible for either of these powers to release him from the allegiance due to the other; that the state can no more release him from his obligations to the <rs>Union</rs> than the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can absolve him from his duties to his state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>This is the most moderate way in which the objection is put. The extreme centralizers go further, and claim that allegiance to the <rs>Union</rs>, or, as they generally express it, to the government&mdash;meaning thereby the federal government &mdash;is paramount, and the obligation to the state only subsidiary&mdash;if, indeed, it exists at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>This latter view, if the more monstrous, is at least the more consistent of the <num value="2">two</num>, for it does not involve the difficulty of a divided allegiance, <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> nor the paradoxical position in which the other places the citizen, in case of a conflict between his state and the other members of the <rs>Union</rs>, of being necessarily a rebel against the general government or a traitor to the state of which he is a citizen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>As to true allegiance, in the light of the principles which have been established, there can be no doubt with regard to it. The primary, paramount allegiance of the citizen is due to the sovereign only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>That sovereign, under our system, is the people&mdash;the people of the state to which he belongs&mdash;the people who constituted the state government which he obeys, and which protects him in the enjoyment of his personal rights&mdash; the people who alone (as far as he is concerned) ordained and established the federal Constitution and federal government&mdash;the people who have reserved to themselves sovereignty, which involves the power to revoke all agencies created by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>The obligation to support the state or federal Constitution and the obedience due to either state or federal government are alike derived from and dependent on the allegiance due to this sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>If the sovereign abolishes the state government and ordains and establishes a new <num value="1">one</num>, the obligation of allegiance requires him to transfer his obedience accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>If the sovereign withdraws from association with its confederates in the <rs>Union</rs>, the allegiance of the citizen requires him to follow the sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Any other course is rebellion or treason&mdash;words which, in the cant of the day, have been so grossly misapplied and perverted as to be made worse than unmeaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>His relation to the <rs>Union</rs> arose from the membership of the state of which he was a citizen, and ceased whenever his state withdrew from it. He cannot owe obedience&mdash;much less allegiance&mdash;to an association from which his sovereign has separated, and thereby withdrawn him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>Every officer of both federal and state governments is required to take an oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, a compact the binding force of which is based upon the sovereignty of the states&mdash;a sovereignty necessarily carrying with it the principles just stated with regard to allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Every such officer is, therefore, virtually sworn to maintain and support the sovereignty of all the states.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Military and naval officers take, in addition, an oath to obey the lawful orders of their superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Such an oath has never been understood to be eternal in its obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>It is dissolved by the death, dismissal, or resignation of the officer who takes it; such resignation is not a mere optional right, but becomes an imperative duty when continuance in the service comes to be in conflict with the ultimate allegiance due to the sovereignty of the state to which he belongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/><pb id="p.156" n="156"/></p> 
<p>A little consideration of these plain and irrefutable truths would show how utterly unworthy and false are the vulgar taunts which attribute <quote>treason</quote> to those who, in the late secession of the <rs>Southern</rs> states, were loyal to the only sovereign entitled to their allegiance, and which still more absurdly prate of the violation of oaths to support <quote>the government,</quote> an oath which nobody ever could have been legally required to take, and which must have been ignorantly confounded with the prescribed oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Nullification and secession are often erroneously treated as if they were <num value="1">one</num> and the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>It is true that both ideas spring from the sovereign right of a state to interpose for the protection of its own people, but they are altogether unlike as to both their extent and the character of the means to be employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was a temporary expedient, intended to restrain action until the question at issue could be submitted to a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">convention of the states</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>It was a remedy which its supporters sought to apply within the <rs>Union</rs>, a means to avoid the last resort&mdash;separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>If the application for a convention should fail, or if the state making it should suffer an adverse decision, the advocates of that remedy have not revealed what they proposed as the next step&mdash;supposing the infraction of the compact to have been of that character which, according to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0125.0022.00156.00419" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, dissolved it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>Secession, on the other hand, was the assertion of the inalienable right of a people to change their government, whenever it ceased to fulfill the purpose for which it was ordained and established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>Under our form of government, and the cardinal principles upon which it was founded, it should have been a peaceful remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>In the late contest, in particular, there was no appeal by the seceding states to the arbitrament of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>There was on their part no invitation nor provocation to war. They stood in an attitude of self-defense, and were attacked for merely exercising a right guaranteed by the original terms of the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>From the earliest period, it was foreseen by the wisest of our statesmen that a danger to the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs> would arise from the conflicting interests of different sections, and every effort was made to secure each of these classes of interests against aggression by the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>As a proof of this may be cited the following extract from <placeName reg="Madison, Dane, Wisconsin" key="tgn,7013966">Madison</placeName>'s report of a speech made by himself in the <rs>Philadelphia</rs> convention on <dateStruct value="1787-06-30"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>The wise men who formed the <rs>Constitution</rs> were not seeking to bind the states together by the material power of a majority; nor were they so blind to the influences of passion and interest as to believe that paper barriers would suffice to restrain a majority actuated by either or both of these motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>They endeavored, therefore, to prevent the conflicts <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> inevitable from the ascendancy of a sectional or party majority, by so distributing the powers of government that each interest might hold a check upon the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>It was believed that the compromises made with regard to representation&mdash;securing to each state an equal vote in the <name>Senate</name>, and in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> giving the states a weight in proportion to their respective population, estimating the negroes as equivalent to <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the same number of free whites&mdash;would have the effect of giving at an early period a majority in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> to the <rs>South</rs>, while the <rs>North</rs> would retain the ascendancy in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>Thus it was supposed that the <num value="2">two</num> great sectional interests would be enabled to restrain each other within the limits of purposes and action beneficial to both.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>The failure of these expectations need not affect our reverence for the intentions of the fathers, or our respect for the means which they devised to carry them into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>That they were mistaken, both as to the maintenance of the balance of sectional power and as to the fidelity and integrity with which the <rs>Congress</rs> was expected to conform to the letter and spirit of its delegated authority, is perhaps to be ascribed less to lack of prophetic foresight, than to that over-sanguine confidence which is the weakness of honest minds, and which was naturally strengthened by the patriotic and fraternal feelings resulting from the great struggle through which they had then but recently passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>They saw, in the sufficiency of the authority delegated to the federal government and in the fullness of the sovereignty retained by the states, a system the strict construction of which was so eminently adapted to indefinite expansion of the confederacy as to embrace every variety of production and consequent diversity of pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>Carried out in the spirit in which it was devised, there was in this system no element of disintegration, but every facility for an enlargement of the circle of the family of states (or nations), so that it scarcely seemed unreasonable to look forward to a fulfillment of the aspiration of <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0125.0023.00159.00425" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,Alexander,,,:2"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, that it might extend over <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>, perhaps over the whole continent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>Not at all incompatible with these views and purposes was the recognition of the right of the states to reassume, if occasion should require it, the powers which they had delegated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>On the contrary, the maintenance of this right was the surest guarantee of the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the denial of it sounded the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> serious note of its dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>The conservative efficiency of <quote>state interposition</quote> for maintenance of the essential principles of the <rs>Union</rs> against aggression or decadence, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most conspicuous features in the debates of the various state <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> conventions by which the <rs>Constitution</rs> was ratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>Perhaps their ideas of the particular form in which this interposition was to be made may have been somewhat indefinite, and left to be reduced to shape by the circumstances when they should arise, but the principle itself was assumed and asserted as fundamental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>But for a firm reliance upon it, as a sure resort in case of need, it may safely be said that the <rs>Union</rs> would never have been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>It would be unjust to the wisdom and sagacity of the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to suppose that they entirely relied on paper barriers for the protection of the rights of minorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>Fresh from the defense of violated charters and faithless aggression on inalienable rights, it might, <hi rend="italics">a priori</hi>, be assumed that they would require something more potential than mere promises to protect them from human depravity and human ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>That they did so is to be found in the debates both of the general and the state conventions, where state interposition was often declared to be the bulwark against usurpation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>At an early period in the history of the federal government, the states of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> found reason to reassert this right of state interposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the famous resolutions drawn by <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0125.0023.00160.00426" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct>, and with some modification adopted by the <orgName n="Kentucky Legislature" type="legislature">legislature of Kentucky</orgName> in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> of that year, it is declared that, <quote>whensoever the <rs>General Government</rs> assumes undelegated powers, its acts are <hi rend="italics">unauthoritative, void, and of no force;</hi> that to this compact each State acceded as a State, and is an integral party; that this Government, created by this compact, was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the measure of its powers; but that, as in all other cases of compact among parties having no common judge, <hi rend="italics">each party has an equal right to judge for itself, as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of redress</hi>. </quote> </p>

<p>These, it is true, were only the resolves of <num value="2">two</num> states, and they were dissented from by several other state legislatures&mdash;not so much on the ground of opposition to the general principles asserted as on that of their being unnecessary in their application to the alien and sedition laws, which were the immediate occasion of their utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>Nevertheless, they were the basis of the contest for the presidency in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, which resulted in their approval by the people in the triumphant election of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0125.0023.00161.00428" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>The last victory obtained under them, and when they were emphasized by adding the construction of them contained in the report of <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0125.0023.00161.00429" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> to the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia legislature</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, was at the election of <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0125.0023.00161.00430" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:6"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>&mdash;the last <rs>President</rs> chosen by vote of a party that could with any propriety be styled <quote>national,</quote> in contradistinction to sectional.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>At a critical and memorable period, that pure spirit, luminous intellect, and devoted adherent of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the great statesman of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, invoked this remedy of state interposition against the <rs>Tariff Act</rs> of <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>, which was deemed injurious and oppressive to his state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>No purpose was then declared to coerce the state, as such, but measures were taken to break the protective shield of her authority and enforce the laws of Congress upon her citizens, by compelling them to pay outside of her ports the duties on imports, which the state had declared unconstitutional and had forbidden to be collected in her ports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>There remained at that day enough of the spirit in which the <rs>Union</rs> had been founded&mdash;enough of respect for the sovereignty of states and of regard for the limitations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;to prevent a conflict of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>Meantime there had been no lack, as we have already seen, of assertions of the sovereign rights of the states from other quarters.

<p>This was submitted to the <rs>Congress</rs>, in order that, if approved by them, it might be referred to the states for adoption or rejection by the several conventions thereof; if adopted by <num value="9">nine</num> of the states, it was to be the compact of union between the states so ratifying the same.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>The new form of government differed in many essential particulars <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> from the old <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>The delegates, intent on the purpose to give greater efficiency to the government of the <rs>Union</rs>, proposed greatly to enlarge its powers, so much so that it was not deemed safe to confide them to a single body, and they were consequently distributed between <num value="3">three</num> independent departments of government, which might be a check upon <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>The Constitution did not, like the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, declare that the states had agreed to a <orgName n="Perpetual Union" type="union">perpetual union</orgName>, but distinctly indicated the hope of its perpetuity by the expression in the preamble of the purpose to <quote>secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>The circumstances under which the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was formed justified the hope of its perpetuity, but the brief existence of the confederation may have been a warning against the renewal of the assertion that the compact should be perpetual.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>A remedy for the embarrassment which had been realized, under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, in obtaining amendments to correct any defects in grants of power, so as to render them effective for the purpose for which they were given, was provided by its <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>It is here to be specially noted that new grants of power, as asked for by the convention, were under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation only to be obtained from the unanimous assent of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Therefore it followed that <num value="2">two</num> of the states which did not ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs> were, so long as they retained that attitude, free from its obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>Thus it is seen that the same principle in regard to obtaining grants of additional power for the federal government formed the rule for the <rs>Union</rs> as it had done for the confederation; that is, that the consent of each and every state was a prerequisite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>The apprehension which justly existed that several of the states might reject the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and under the rule of unanimity defeat it, led to the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> article of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which provided that the ratification by the conventions of <num value="9">nine</num> states should be sufficient for the establishment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> between the states ratifying it, which of course contemplated leaving the others, more or less in number, separate and distinct from the <num value="9">nine</num> states forming a new government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>Thus was the <rs>Union</rs> to be a voluntary compact, and all the powers of its government to be derived from the assent of each of its members.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>These powers as proposed by the <rs>Constitution</rs> were so extensive as to create alarm and opposition by some of the most influential men in many of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>It is known that the objection of the patriot <rs>Samuel Adams</rs> was only overcome by an assurance that such an amendment as the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> would be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>Like opposition was by like assurance <pb id="p.166" n="166"/> elsewhere overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>That article is in these words: <quote>The powers not delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, nor prohibited by it to the <name>States</name>, are reserved to the <name>States</name> respectively or to the people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/></p> 
<p>Amendment, however, of the delegated powers was made more easy than it had been under the confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>Ratification by <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the states was sufficient under the <rs>Constitution</rs> for the adoption of an amendment to it. As this power of amendment threatens to be the <rs>Aaron</rs>'s rod which will swallow up the rest, I propose to give it special examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>What is the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>The whole body of the instrument, the history of its formation and adoption, as well as the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> amendment, added in an abundance of caution, clearly show it to be an instrument enumerating the powers delegated by the states to the federal government, their common agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>It is specifically declared that all which was not so delegated was reserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>On this mass of reserved powers, those which the states declined to grant, the federal government was expressly forbidden to intrude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>Of what value would this prohibition have been, if <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the states could, without the assent of a particular state, invade the domain which that state had reserved for its own exclusive use and control?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>It has heretofore, I hope, been satisfactorily demonstrated that the states were sovereigns before they formed the <rs>Union</rs>, and that they have never surrendered their sovereignty, but have only entrusted to their common agent certain functions of sovereignty to be used for their common welfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>Among the powers delegated was <num value="1">one</num> to amend the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which, it is submitted, was merely the power to amend the delegated grants, and these were obtained by the separate and independent action of each state acceding to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>When we consider how carefully each clause was discussed in the <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general convention</orgName>, and how closely each was scrutinized in the conventions of the several states, the conclusion cannot be avoided that all was specified which it was intended to bestow, and not a few of the wisest in that day held that too much power had been conferred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>Aware of the imperfection of everything devised by man, it was foreseen that, in the exercise of the functions entrusted to the general government, experience might reveal the necessity of modification&mdash;i.e., amendment&mdash;and power was therefore given to amend, in a certain manner, the delegated trusts so as to make them efficient for the purposes designed, or to prevent their misconstruction or abuse to the injury or oppression of any of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>In support of this view I <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> refer to the historical fact that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="10">ten</num> amendments of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, nearly coeval with it, all refer either to the powers delegated, or are directed to the greater security of the rights which were guarded by express limitations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>The distinction in the mind of the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> between amendment and delegation of power seems to me clearly drawn by the fact that the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, which was a proposition to the states to grant enumerated powers, was only to have effect between the ratifying states; the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> article provided that amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> might be adopted by <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the states, and thereby be valid as part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>It thus appears that a smaller power was required for an amendment than for a grant, and the natural if not necessary conclusion is that it was because an amendment must belong to, and grow out of, a grant previously made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>If a so-called amendment could have been the means of obtaining a new power, is to be supposed that those watchful guardians of community independence, for which the war of the <name>Revolution</name> had been fought, would have been reconciled to the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by the declaration that the powers not delegated are reserved to the states?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Unless the power of amendment be confined to the grants of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, there can be no security to the reserved rights of a minority less than a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>I submit that the word <quote>amendment</quote> necessarily implies an improvement upon something which is possessed, and can have no proper application to that which did not previously exist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>The apprehension that was felt of this power of amendment by the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is shown by the restrictions placed upon the exercise of several of the delegated powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>For example: power was given to admit new states, but no new state should be erected within the jurisdiction of any other state, nor be formed by the junction of <num value="2">two</num> or more states, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of those states; the power to regulate commerce was limited by the prohibition of an amendment affecting, for a certain time, the migration or importation of persons whom any of the existing states should think proper to admit; by the very important provision for the protection of the smaller states and the preservation of their equality in the <rs>Union</rs>, the compact in regard to the membership of the <num value="2">two</num> houses of Congress should not be so amended that any <quote>State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the <name>Senate</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>These limitations and prohibitions on the power of amendment all refer to clauses of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to things which existed as part of the general <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> government; they were not needed, and therefore not to be found in relation to the reserved powers of the states, on which the general government was forbidden to intrude by the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> article of the amendments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>In view of the small territory of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> states, comparatively to that of the <rs>Middle</rs> and Southern states, and the probability of the creation of new states in the large territory of some of these latter, it might well have been anticipated that in the course of time the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> states would become less than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the members of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>Nothing is less likely than that the watchful patriots of that region would have consented to a form of government which should give to a majority of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the states the power to deprive them of their dearest rights and privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>Yet to this extremity the new-born theory of the power of amendment would go. Against this insidious assault, this wooden horse which it is threatened to introduce into the citadel of our liberties, I have sought to warn the inheritors of our free institutions, and earnestly do invoke the resistance of all true patriots. </p></div2></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>With the failure of the <orgName n="Senate Committee" type="committee">Senate Committee</orgName> of <num value="13">Thirteen</num> to come to any agreement, the last reasonable hope of a pacific settlement of difficulties within the <rs>Union</rs> was extinguished in the minds of those most reluctant to abandon the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>The year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> opened, as we have seen, upon the spectacle of a general belief, among the people of the planting states, in the necessity of an early secession, as the only possible alternative left them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>It has already been shown that the calmness and deliberation, with which the measures requisite for withdrawal were adopted and executed, afford the best refutation of the charge that they were the result of haste, passion, or precipitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>Still more contrary to truth is the assertion, so often recklessly made and reiterated, that the people of the <rs>South</rs> were led into secession, against their will and their better judgment, by a few ambitious and discontented politicians.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>The truth is that the <rs>Southern</rs> people were in advance of their representatives throughout, and that these latter were not agitators or leaders in the popular movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>They were in harmony with its great principles, but their influence, with very few exceptions, was exerted to restrain rather than to accelerate their application, and to allay rather than to stimulate excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>As sentinels on the outer wall, the people had a right to look to them for warning of approaching danger; as we have seen, in the last session of the last Congress that preceded the disruption, Southern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, of the class generally considered extremists, served on a committee of pacification, and strove earnestly to promote its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>Failing in this, they still exerted themselves to prevent the commission of any act that might result in bloodshed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>Invention has busied itself, to the exhaustion of its resources, in the creation of imaginary <quote>cabals,</quote> <quote>conspiracies,</quote> and <quote>intrigues,</quote> among the <rs>Senators</rs> and Representatives of the <rs>South</rs> on duty in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>Nothing would seem to be too absurd for such uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>Thus, it has been gravely stated that a caucus of Southern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, held in the early part of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, <quote>resolved to assume to themselves the political power of the <rs>South</rs></quote>; that they took entire control of all political and military operations; that they issued instructions for the passage of ordinances of secession, and for the seizure of forts, arsenals, and customhouses; with much more of the like groundless fiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>Statements such as these are a travesty upon history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>That the representatives of the <rs>South</rs> held conference with <num value="1">one</num> another and took counsel together, as men having common interests and threatened by common dangers, is true, and is the full extent of the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>That they communicated to friends at home information of what was passing is to be presumed, and would have been most obligatory if it had not been that the published proceedings rendered such communication needless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>But that any such man, or committee of men, should have undertaken to direct the mighty movement then progressing throughout the <rs>South</rs>, or to control, through the telegraph and the mails, the will and the judgment of conventions of the people, assembled under the full consciousness of the dignity of that sovereignty which they represented, would have been an extraordinary degree of folly and presumption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>The absurdity of the statement is further evident from a consideration of the fact that the movements which culminated in the secession of the several states began before the meeting of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>They were <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> not inaugurated, prosecuted, or controlled by the <rs>Senators</rs> and Representatives in Congress, but by the governors, legislatures, and finally by the delegates of the people in conventions of the respective states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>I believe I may fairly claim to have possessed a full share of the confidence of the people of the state which I in part represented; proof has already been furnished to show how little effect my own influence could have upon their action, even in the negative capacity of a brake upon the wheels, by means of which it was hurried on to consummation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>As for the imputation of holding our seats as a vantage ground in plotting for the dismemberment of the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;in connection with which the <rs>Count</rs> of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> does me the honor to single out my name for special mention&mdash;it is a charge so dishonorable, if true, to its object&mdash;so disgraceful, if false, to its author&mdash;as to be outside of the proper limit of discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>It is a charge which no accuser ever made in my presence, though I had in public debate more than once challenged its assertion and denounced its falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>It is enough to say that I always held, and repeatedly avowed, the principle that a Senator in Congress occupied the position of an ambassador from the state which he represented to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as well as in some sense a member of the government; that, in either capacity, it would be dishonorable to use his powers and privileges for the destruction or for the detriment of the government to which he was accredited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>Acting on this principle, as long as I held a seat in the <name>Senate</name>, my best efforts were directed to the maintenance of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the <rs>Union</rs> resulting from it, and to make the general government an effective agent of the states for its prescribed purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>As soon as the paramount allegiance due to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> forbade a continuance of these efforts, I withdrew from the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>To say that during this period I did nothing secretly, in conflict with what was done or professed openly, would be merely to assert my own integrity, which would be worthless to those who may doubt it, and superfluous to those who believe in it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>With regard to the forts, arsenals, etc., something more remains to be said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>The authorities of the <rs>Southern</rs> states immediately after, and in some cases a few days before, their actual secession, took possession (in every instance without resistance or bloodshed) of forts, arsenals, customhouses, and other public property within their respective limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>I do not propose at this time to consider the question of their right to do so; that may be more properly done hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>But it may not be out of <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> place briefly to refer to the statement, often made, that the absence of troops from the military posts in the <rs>South</rs>, which enabled the states so quietly to take such possession, was the result of collusion and prearrangement between the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders and the federal <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, <persName n="Floyd,,John,B.,," id="n0125.0025.00174.00434" reg="default:Floyd,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>It is a sufficient answer to this allegation to state the fact that the absence of troops from these posts, instead of being exceptional, was, and still is, their ordinary condition in time of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>At the very moment when these sentences are being written (<dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>), although the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>Certainly, those within the range of my personal information are occupied, as they were at that time, only by ordnance sergeants or fort keepers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>There were, however, some exceptions to this general rule&mdash;especially in the defensive works of the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, the forts at <placeName key="tgn,7021537" n="1.000 56" reg="key west, florida keys, monroe, florida">Key West</placeName> and the <rs>Dry Tortugas</rs>, and those protecting the entrance of <placeName reg="Pensacola Bay, Florida, Florida" key="tgn,1113605">Pensacola Bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>The events which occurred in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> will be more conveniently noticed hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>The island forts near the extreme southern point of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> were too isolated and too remote from population to be disturbed at that time; the situation long maintained at the mouth of <placeName reg="Pensacola Bay, Florida, Florida" key="tgn,1113605">Pensacola Bay</placeName> affords, however, a signal illustration of the forbearance and conciliatory spirit that animated Southern counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>For a long time <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>, on the island of <placeName reg="Santa Rosa, Sonoma, California" key="tgn,2014133">Santa Rosa</placeName>, at the entrance to the harbor, was occupied only by a small body of federal soldiers and marines&mdash;less than <num value="100">one hundred</num>, all told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>Immediately opposite, and in possession of the other <num value="2">two</num> forts and the adjacent navy yard, was a strong force of volunteer troops of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> (which might, on short notice, have been largely increased), ready and anxious to attack and take possession of <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>That they could have done so is unquestionable, and if mere considerations of military advantage had been consulted, it would surely have been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>But the love of peace and the purpose to preserve it, together with a revulsion from the thought of engaging in fraternal strife, were more potent than <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> considerations of probable interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>During the anxious period of uncertainty and apprehension which ensued, the efforts of the <rs>Southern Senators</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> were employed to dissuade (they could not command) from any aggressive movement, however justifiable, that might lead to collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>These efforts were exerted through written and telegraphic communications to the governors of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, the commander of the <rs>Southern</rs> troops, and other influential persons near the scene of operations.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>The significance of these resolutions was the admission that we could not longer advise delay, and even that was unimportant under the circumstances, for <num value="3">three</num> of the states concerned had taken final action on the subject before the resolutions could have been communicated to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>As an expression of opinion, they merely stated that of which we had all become convinced by the experience of the previous month &mdash;that our long-cherished hopes had proved illusory&mdash;that further efforts in Congress would be unavailing, and that nothing remained, except that the states should take the matter into their own hands, as final <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> judges of their wrongs and of the measure of redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>They recommended the formation of a confederacy among the seceding states as early as possible after their secession&mdash;advice the expediency of which could hardly be questioned, either by friend or foe. As to the <quote>instructions</quote> asked for with regard to the propriety of continuing to hold their seats, I suppose it must have been caused by some diversity of opinion which then and long afterward continued to exist, and the practical value of which must have been confined to <rs type="role" reg="Senator">Senators</rs> of states which did not actually secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>For myself, I can only say that no advice could have prevailed on me to hold a seat in the <name>Senate</name> after receiving notice that <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> had withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>The best evidence that my associates thought likewise is the fact that, although no instructions were given them, they promptly withdrew on the receipt of official information of the withdrawal of the states which they represented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>It will not be amiss here briefly to state what were my position and feelings at the period now under consideration, as they have been the subject of gross and widespread misrepresentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>It is not only untrue, but absurd, to attribute to me motives of personal ambition to be gratified by a dismemberment of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>Much of my life had been spent in the military and civil service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>Whatever reputation I had acquired was identified with their history; if future preferment had been the object, it would have led me to cling to the <rs>Union</rs> as long as a shred of it should remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>If any, judging after the event, should assume that I was allured by the high office subsequently conferred upon me by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the answer to any such conclusion has been made by others, to whom it was well known before the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was formed, that I had no desire to be its <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>When the suggestion was made to me, I expressed a decided objection, and gave reasons of a public and permanent character against being placed in that position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>Furthermore, I then held the office of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Senator from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> which I preferred to all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>The kindness of the people had <num value="3">three</num> times conferred it upon me, and I had no reason to fear that it would not be given again, as often as desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>So far from wishing to change this position for any other, I had specially requested my friends (some of whom had thought of putting me in nomination for the presidency of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>) not to permit <quote>my name to be used before the <rs>Convention</rs> for any nomination whatever.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>The responsibilities were great; the labor, the vexations, the disappointments, were greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>Those who have intimately known the official and personal life of our <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> cannot fail to remember how few have left the office as happy men as when they entered it, how darkly the shadows gathered around the setting sun, and how eagerly the multitude would turn to gaze upon another orb just rising to take its place in the political firmament.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>Worn by incessant fatigue, broken in fortune, debarred by public opinion, prejudice, or tradition, from future employment, the wisest and best who have filled that office have retired to private life, to remember rather the failure of their hopes than the success of their efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>He must, indeed, be a self-confident man who could hope to fill the chair of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> with satisfaction to himself, with the assurance of receiving on his retirement the meed awarded by the people to that great man, that he had <quote>lived enough for life and for glory,</quote> or even of feeling that the sacrifice of self had been compensated by the service rendered to his country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>The following facts were presented in a letter written several years ago by <persName n="Clay,the Honorable,C.,C.,," id="n0125.0025.00177.00440" reg="default:Clay,C.,C.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, who was <num value="1">one</num> of my most intimate associates in the <name>Senate</name>, with reference to certain misstatements to which his attention had been called by <num value="1">one</num> of my friends: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>I am quite sure that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0025.00177.00443" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> neither expected nor desired the nomination for the <name>Presidency</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>He never evinced any such aspiration, by word or sign, to me&mdash;with whom he was, I believe, as intimate and confidential as with any person outside of his own family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>I think he only <hi rend="italics">regretfully</hi> consented to it, as a political necessity for the preservation of popular and State rights, which were seriously threatened by the triumph <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> of a sectional party who were pledged to make war on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>I know that some leading men, and even Mississippians, thought him too moderate and backward, and found fault with him for not taking a leading part in secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>No <quote>plan of secession</quote> or <quote>scheme of revolution</quote> was, to my knowledge, discussed&mdash;certainly none matured&mdash;at the caucus, <dateStruct value="1861-01-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> unless, forsooth, the resolutions appended hereto be so held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>They comprise the sum and substance of what was said and done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>I never heard that the caucus advised the <rs>South</rs> <quote>to accumulate munitions of war,</quote> or <quote>to organize and equip an army of <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men,</quote> or determined <quote>to hold on as long as possible to the <rs>Southern</rs> seats.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>So far from it, a majority of Southern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> seemed to think there would be no war; that the dominant party in the <rs>North</rs> desired separation from the <rs>South</rs>, and would gladly let their <quote>erring sisters go in peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>I could multiply proofs of such a disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>As to holding on to their seats, no <orgName n="Southern Legislature" type="legislature">Southern Legislature</orgName> advised it, no Southern <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> who favored secession did so but <num value="1">one</num>, and none others wished to do so, I believe.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>The <quote>plan of secession,</quote> if any, and the purpose of secession, unquestionably, originated, not in <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>, or with the <rs>Senators</rs> or <rs type="role" reg="Representative">Representatives</rs> of the <rs>South</rs>, but among the people of the several States, many months before it was attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>They followed no leaders at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> or elsewhere, but acted for themselves, with an independence and unanimity unprecedented in any movement of such magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>As her <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, I endeavored plainly to state her position in the annexed remarks addressed to the <name>Senate</name> in taking leave of the body: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>Under these circumstances, of course, my functions are terminated here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>It has seemed to me proper, however, that I should appear in the <name>Senate</name> to announce that fact to my associates, and I will say but very little more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>The occasion does not invite me to go into argument; and my physical condition would not permit me to do so, if it were otherwise; and yet it seems to become me to say something on the part of the <rs>State</rs> I here represent on an occasion so solemn as this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>It is known to <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> who have served with me here that I have for many years advocated, as an essential attribute of State sovereignty, the right of a State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>Therefore, if I had not believed there was justifiable cause, if I had thought that <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> was acting without sufficient provocation, <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> or without an existing necessity, I should still, under my theory of the <rs>Government</rs>, because of my allegiance to the <rs>State</rs> of which I am a citizen, have been bound by her action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>I however, may be permitted to say that I do think she has justifiable cause, and I approve of her act. I conferred with her people before that act was taken, counseled them then that, if the state of things which they apprehended should exist when their Convention met, they should take the action which they have now adopted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>I hope none who hear me will confound this expression of mine with the advocacy of the right of a State to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>, and to disregard its constitutional obligations by the nullification of the law. Such is not my theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>Nullification and secession, so often confounded, are, indeed, antagonistic principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>Nullification is a remedy which it is sought to apply within the <rs>Union</rs>, and against the agent of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>It is only to be justified when the agent has violated his constitutional obligations, and a State, assuming to judge for itself, denies the right of the agent thus to act, and appeals to the other States of the <rs>Union</rs> for a decision; but, when the <name>States</name> themselves and when the people of the <name>States</name> have so acted as to convince us that they will not regard our constitutional rights, then, and then for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, arises the doctrine of secession in its practical application.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>A great man who now reposes with his fathers, and who has often been arraigned for a want of fealty to the <rs>Union</rs>, advocated the doctrine of nullification because it preserved the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>It was because of his deep-seated attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;his determination to find some remedy for existing ills short of a severance of the ties which bound <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to the other States&mdash;that <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0027.00190.00486" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> advocated the doctrine of nullification, which he proclaimed to be peaceful, to be within the limits of State power, not to disturb the <rs>Union</rs>, but only to be a means of bringing the agent before the tribunal of the <name>States</name> for their judgment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>Secession belongs to a different class of remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>It is to be justified upon the basis that the <name>States</name> are sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>There was a time when none denied it. I hope the time may come again when a better comprehension of the theory of our Government, and the inalienable rights of the people of the <name>States</name>, will prevent any <num value="1">one</num> from denying that each State is a sovereign, and thus may reclaim the grants which it has made to any agent whomsoever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>I, therefore, say I concur in the action of the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, believing it to be necessary and proper, and should have been bound by their action if my belief had been otherwise; and this brings me to the important point which I wish, on this last occasion, to present to the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>It is by this confounding of nullification and secession that the name of a great man whose ashes now mingle with his mother earth has been evoked to justify coercion against a seceded State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>That is not the case which is now presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>They have no relation to any foreign country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>It is a perversion of terms&mdash;at least, it is a great misapprehension of the case&mdash;which cites that expression for application to a State which has withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>It has been a conviction of pressing necessity&mdash;it has been a belief that we are to be deprived in the <rs>Union</rs> of the rights which our fathers bequeathed to us&mdash; which has brought <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to her present decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>That <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> is to be construed by the circumstances and purposes for which it was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>The communities were declaring their independence; the people of those communities were asserting that no man was born&mdash;to use the language of <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0027.00191.00488" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>&mdash;booted and spurred, to ride over the rest of mankind; that men were created equal&mdash;meaning the men of the political community; that there was no divine right to rule; that no man inherited the right to govern; that there were no classes by which power and place descended to families; but that all stations were equally within the grasp of each member of the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>These were the great principles they announced; these were the purposes for which they made their declaration; these were the ends to which their enunciation was directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>They have no reference to the slave; else, how happened it that among the items of arraignment against <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName> was that he endeavored to do just what the <rs>North</rs> has been endeavoring of late to do, to stir up insurrection among our slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>Had the <name>Declaration</name> announced that the negroes were free and equal, how was the prince to be arraigned for raising up insurrection among them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>And how was this to be enumerated among the high crimes which caused the colonies to sever their connection with the mother-country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>When our Constitution was formed, the same idea was rendered more palpable; for there we <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> find provision made for that very class of persons as property; they were not put upon the footing of equality with white men&mdash;not even upon that of paupers and convicts; but, so far as representation was concerned, were discriminated against as a lower caste, only to be represented in the numerical proportion of <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>This is done, not in hostility to others, not to injure any section of the country, not even for our own pecuniary benefit, but from the high and solemn motive of defending and protecting the rights we inherited, and which it is our duty to transmit unshorn to our children.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>During the interval between the announcement by telegraph of the secession of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and the receipt of the official notification which enabled me to withdraw from the <name>Senate</name>, rumors were in circulation of a purpose, on the part of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>This threat received little attention from those most concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>Indeed, it was thought that it might not be an undesirable mode of testing the question of the right of a state to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>No attempt, however, was made to arrest any of the retiring members; after a delay of a few days in necessary preparations, I left <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> for <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, passing through <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">east</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, a small part of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">north</rs> Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>A deep interest in the events which had recently occurred was exhibited by the people of these states, and much anxiety was indicated as to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>Many years of agitation had made them familiar with the idea of separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>Nearly <num value="2">two</num> generations had risen to manhood since it had begun to be discussed as a possible alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>Few, very few, of the <rs>Southern</rs> people had ever regarded it as a desirable event, or otherwise than as a last resort for escape from evils more intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>It was a calamity which, however threatened, they had still hoped might be averted or indefinitely postponed, and they had regarded with contempt, rather than anger, the ravings of a party in the <rs>North</rs> which denounced the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> and persistently defamed their brethren of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>Now, however, as well in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, neither of which had yet seceded, as in the more Southern states, which had already taken that step, the danger so often prophesied was perceived to be at the door, and eager inquiries were made as to what would happen next&mdash;especially as to the probability of war between the states.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>The course which events were likely to take was shrouded in the greatest uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>In the minds of many there was the not unreasonable hope (which had been expressed by the commissioner sent from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>) that the secession of <num value="6">six</num> Southern states&mdash;certainly <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> soon to be followed by that of others&mdash;would so arouse the sober thought and better feeling of the <rs>Northern</rs> people as to compel their representatives to agree to a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">convention of the states</orgName>, and that such guarantees would be given as would secure to the <rs>South</rs> the domestic tranquillity and equality in the <rs>Union</rs> which were rights assured under the federal compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>There were others, and they the most numerous class, who considered that the separation would be final, but peaceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>For my own part, while believing that secession was a right, and properly a peaceable remedy, I had never believed that it would be permitted to be peaceably exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>Very few in the <rs>South</rs> at that time agreed with me, and my answers to queries on the subject were, therefore, as unexpected as they were unwelcome.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>On my arrival at <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>, the capital of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, I found that the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">convention of the state</orgName> had made provision for a state army, and had appointed me to the command, with the rank of a major general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/><num value="4">Four</num> <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">brigadier generals</rs>, appointed in like manner by the convention, were awaiting my arrival for assignment to duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>After the preparation of the necessary rules and regulations, the division of the state into districts, the apportionment among them of the troops to be raised, and the appointment of officers of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, as authorized by the ordinance of the convention, such measures as were practicable were taken to obtain the necessary arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>The state had few serviceable weapons, and no establishment for their manufacture or repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>This fact (which is true of other Southern states as of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>) is a clear proof of the absence of any desire or expectation of war. If the purpose of the <rs>Northern</rs> states to make war upon us because of secession had been foreseen, preparation to meet the consequences would have been contemporaneous with the adoption of a resort to that remedy&mdash;a remedy the possibility of which had for many years been contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>Had the <rs>Southern</rs> states possessed arsenals, and collected in them the requisite supplies of arms and munitions, such preparation would not only have placed them more nearly on an equality with the <rs>North</rs> in the beginning of the war, but might, perhaps, have been the best conservator of peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>Let us, the survivors, however, not fail to do credit to the generous credulity which could not understand how, in violation of the compact of union, a war could be waged against the states, or why they should be invaded because their people had deemed it necessary to withdraw from an association which had failed to fulfill the ends for which they had entered into it, and which, having been broken to their injury by the other parties, had ceased to be binding upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>It is a satisfaction to <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> know that the calamities which have befallen the <rs>Southern</rs> states were the result of their credulous reliance on the power of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that if it failed to protect their rights, it would at least suffice to prevent an attempt at coercion, if, in the last resort, they peacefully withdrew from the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>When, in after times, the passions of the day shall have subsided, and all the evidence shall have been collected and compared, the philosophical inquirer, who asks why the majority of the stronger section invaded the peaceful homes of their late associates, will be answered by history: <quote>The lust of empire impelled them to wage against their weaker neighbors a war of subjugation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>As this had been suggested as a probable event, and what appeared to me adequate precautions had been taken to prevent it, I was surprised, and still more, disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>For reasons which it is not now necessary <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> to state, I had not believed myself as well suited to the office as some others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>I thought myself better adapted to command in the field; <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> had given me the position which I preferred to any other&mdash;the highest rank in her army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>Looking forward to the speedy establishment of a permanent government to take the place of this, which by its greater moral and physical power will be better able to combat with many difficulties that arise from the conflicting interests of separate nations, I enter upon the duties of the office to which I have been chosen with the hope that the beginning of our career, as a Confederacy, may not be obstructed by hostile opposition to our enjoyment of the separate existence and independence we have asserted, and which with the blessing of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, we intend to maintain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>Our present political position has been achieved in a manner unprecedented in the history of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>It illustrates the <rs>American</rs> idea that governments rest on the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish them at will whenever they become destructive of the ends for which they were established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2414"/>The declared purpose of the compact of the <rs>Union</rs> from which we have withdrawn was to <quote>establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our prosperity</quote>; and when, in the judgment of the sovereign States composing this Confederacy, it has been perverted from the purposes for which it was ordained, and ceased to answer the ends for which it was established, a peaceful appeal to the ballot-box declared that, so far as they are concerned, the <rs>Government</rs> created by that compact should cease to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>In this they merely asserted the right which the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> of <dateStruct value="1776-07-04"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, defined to be <quote>inalienable.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>Of the time and occasion of its exercise they as sovereigns were the final judges, each for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>The impartial and enlightened verdict of mankind will vindicate the rectitude of our conduct; and He who knows the hearts of men will judge of the sincerity with which we have labored to preserve the <rs>Government</rs> of our fathers in its spirit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>The right solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and which has been solemnly affirmed and reaffirmed in the <name>Bills</name> of Rights of the <name>States</name> <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> subsequently admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, undeniably recognizes in the people the power to resume the authority delegated for the purposes of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>Thus the sovereign States here represented have proceeded to form this Confederacy; and it is by abuse of language that their act has been denominated a revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>They formed a new alliance, but within each State its government has remained; so that the rights of person and property have not been disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>The agent through which they communicated with foreign nations is changed, but this does not necessarily interrupt their international relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>Sustained by the consciousness that the transition from the former Union to the present Confederacy has not proceeded from a disregard on our part of just obligations, or any failure to perform every constitutional duty, moved by no interest or passion to invade the rights of others, anxious to cultivate peace and commerce with all nations, if we may not hope to avoid war, we may at least expect that posterity will acquit us of having needlessly engaged in it. Doubly justified by the absence of wrong on our part, and by wanton aggression on the part of others, there can be no cause to doubt that the courage and patriotism of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will be found equal to any measures of defense which their honor and security may require.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>An agricultural people, whose chief interest is the export of commodities required in every manufacturing country, our true policy is peace, and the freest trade which our necessities will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>It is alike our interest and that of all those to whom we would sell, and from whom we would buy, that there should be the fewest practicable restrictions upon the interchange of these commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>There can, however, be but little rivalry between ours and any manufacturing or navigating community, such as the <rs>Northeastern States</rs> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>It must follow, therefore, that mutual interest will invite to good &mdash; will and kind offices on both parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>If, however, passion or lust of dominion should cloud the judgment or inflame the ambition of those States, we must prepare to meet the emergency and maintain, by the final arbitrament of the sword, the position which we have assumed among the nations of the earth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>We have entered upon the career of independence, and it must be inflexibly pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>Through many years of controversy with our late associates of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, we have vainly endeavored to secure tranquillity and obtain respect for the rights to which we were entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>As a necessity, not a choice, we have resorted to the remedy of separation, and henceforth our energies must be directed to the conduct of our own affairs, and the perpetuity of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> which we have formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>If a just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to pursue our separate political career, my most earnest desire will have been fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>But if this be denied to us, and the integrity of our territory and jurisdiction be assailed, it will but remain for us with firm resolve to appeal to arms and invoke the blessings of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> on a just cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>As a consequence of our new condition and relations, and with a view to meet anticipated wants, it will be necessary to provide for the speedy and efficient organization of branches of the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive department</orgName> having special charge of foreign intercourse, finance, military affairs, and the postal service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>I also suggest that for the protection of our harbors and commerce on the high seas, a navy adapted to those objects will be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>But this, as well as other subjects appropriate to our necessities, have doubtless engaged the attention of Congress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>With a Constitution differing only from that of our fathers in so far as it is explanatory of their well-known intent, freed from sectional conflicts, which have interfered with the pursuit of the general welfare, it is not unreasonable to expect that States from which we have recently parted may seek to unite their fortunes to ours under the <rs>Government</rs> which we have instituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>For this your Constitution makes adequate provision; but beyond this, if I mistake not the judgment and will of the people, a reunion with the <name>States</name> from which we have separated is neither practicable nor desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>To increase the power, develop the resources, and promote the happiness of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it is requisite that there should be so much of homogeneity that the welfare of every portion shall be the aim of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>When this does not exist, antagonisms are engendered which must and should result in separation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>Actuated solely by the desire to preserve our own rights and promote our own welfare, the separation by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has been marked by no aggression upon others, and followed by no domestic convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>Our industrial pursuits have received no check, the cultivation of our fields has progressed as heretofore, and, even should we be involved in war, there would be no considerable diminution in the production of the staples which have constituted our exports, and in which the commercial world has an interest scarcely less than our own. This common interest of the producer and consumer can only be interrupted by exterior force which would obstruct the transmission of our staples to foreign markets&mdash;a course of conduct which would be as unjust, as it would be detrimental, to manufacturing and commercial interests abroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>Should reason guide the action of the <rs>Government</rs> from which we have separated, a policy so detrimental to the civilized world, the <rs>Northern States</rs> included, could not be dictated by even the strongest desire to inflict injury upon us; but, if the contrary should prove true, a terrible responsibility will rest upon it, and the suffering of <num value="1000000">millions</num> will bear testimony to the folly and wickedness of our aggressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>In the meantime there will remain to us, besides the ordinary means before suggested, the well-known resources for retaliation upon the commerce of an enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2445"/>Experience in public stations, of subordinate grade to this which your kindness has conferred, has taught me that toil and care and disappointment are the price of official elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2446"/>You will see many errors to forgive, many deficiencies to tolerate; but you shall not find in me either want of zeal or fidelity to the cause that is to me the highest in hope, and of most enduring affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2447"/>Your generosity has bestowed upon me an undeserved distinction, <num value="1">one</num> which I neither sought nor desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2448"/>Upon the continuance of that sentiment, and upon your wisdom and patriotism, I rely to direct and support me in the performance of the duties required at my hands.

<p>We have changed the constituent parts, but not the system of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2450"/>The Constitution framed by our fathers is that of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>In their exposition of it, and in the judicial construction it has received, we have a light which reveals its true meaning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2452"/>Thus instructed as to the true meaning and just interpretation of that instrument, and ever remembering that all offices are but trusts held for the people, and that powers delegated are to be strictly construed, I will hope by due diligence in the performance of my duties, though I may disappoint your expectations, yet to retain, when retiring, something of the good-will and confidence which welcome my entrance into office.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2453"/>It is joyous in the midst of perilous times to look around upon a people united in heart, where <num value="1">one</num> purpose of high resolve animates and actuates the whole; where the sacrifices to be made are not weighed in the balance against honor and right and liberty and equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2454"/>Obstacles may retard, but they can not long prevent, the progress of a movement sanctified by its justice and sustained by a virtuous people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2455"/>Reverently let us invoke the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of our Fathers to guide and protect us in our efforts to perpetuate the principles which by his blessing they were able to vindicate, establish, and transmit to their posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>Who should be <rs type="role2">President</rs>, was the absorbing question of the day. It engaged the attention of all present, and elicited many letters from our respective constituencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>The delegates of the different States met in secret session to select their candidate and spokesman.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>Of what occurred in these various meetings I can not speak authoritatively as to other States, as their proceedings were considered secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>Early in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> the attention of the whole country was attracted to extraordinary preparations, in New York and other Northern ports, for an extensive military and naval expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>These preparations were commenced in secrecy for an expedition whose destination was concealed, and only became known when nearly completed; and on the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">5th</day></dateStruct>, <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, and <dateStruct value="-04-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, transports and vessels of war, with troops, munitions, and military supplies, sailed from Northern ports, bound southward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/><pb id="p.241" n="241"/></p> 
<p>Alarmed by so extraordinary a demonstration, the <rs>Commissioners</rs> requested the delivery of an answer to their official communication of the <dateStruct value="-03-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and the reply, dated on the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num> of the previous month, was obtained, from which it appears that, during the whole interval, while the <rs>Commissioners</rs> were receiving assurances calculated to inspire hope of the success of their mission, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> and the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had already determined to hold no intercourse with them whatever, to refuse even to listen to any proposals they had to make; and had profited by the delay created by their own assurances, in order to prepare secretly the means for effective hostile operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>That these assurances were given, has been virtually confessed by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by its act of sending a messenger to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> to give notice of its purpose to use force, if opposed in its intention of supplying <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>Here, in the brief hour immediately before the outburst of the long-gathering storm, although it can hardly be necessary for the reader who has carefully considered what has already been written, we may pause for a moment to contemplate the attitude of the parties to the contest and the grounds on which they respectively stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>I do not now refer to the original causes of controversy&mdash;to the comparative claims of statehood and union, or to the question of the right or the wrong of secession &mdash;but to the proximate and immediate causes of conflict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>The fact that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was a state&mdash;whatever her relations may have been to the other states&mdash;is not and cannot be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>It is equally undeniable that the ground on which <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was built was ceded by <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in trust for the defense of her own soil and her own chief harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>This has been shown, by ample evidence, to have been the principle governing all cessions by the states of sites for military purposes, but it applies with special force to the case of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>The streams flowing into that harbor, from source to mouth, lie entirely within the limits of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">state of South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>No other state or combination of states could have any distinct interest or concern in the maintenance of a fortress at that point, unless as a means of aggression against <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>If <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was a mere province, in a state of open rebellion, the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had a right to retain its hold of any fortified place within her limits which happened to be in its possession, and it would have had an equal right to acquire possession of any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>The right or the wrong of either depended entirely upon the question of the rightful power of the federal government to coerce a state into submission&mdash;a power which, as we have seen, was unanimously rejected in the formation of the federal Constitution, and which was still unrecognized by many, perhaps by a majority, even of those who denied the right of a state to secede.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>If there existed any hope or desire for a peaceful settlement of the questions at issue between the states, either party had a right to demand that, pending such settlement, there should be no hostile grasp upon its throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>This grip had been held on the throat of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> for almost <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> from the period of her secession, and no forcible resistance to it had yet been made.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>The commissioners sent by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, after having been shamefully deceived, as has been heretofore fully set forth, left the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> capital to report the result of their mission to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>The bloodless bombardment and surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> occurred on <dateStruct value="1861-04-13"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="13">13</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>The voluntary withdrawal of the garrison by the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> had been considered, and those best qualified to judge believed it had been promised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Yet, when instead of the fulfillment of just expectations, instead of the withdrawal of the garrison, a hostile expedition was organized and sent forward, the urgency of the case required its reduction <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> before it should be reenforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>Had there been delay, the more serious conflict between larger forces, land and naval, would scarcely have been bloodless, as the bombardment fortunately was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>But it should be stated that the threats implied in the declarations that the <rs>Union</rs> could not exist part slave and part free, and that the <rs>Union</rs> should be preserved, and the denial of the right of a state peaceably to withdraw, were virtually a declaration of war, and the sending of an army and navy to attack was the result to have been anticipated as the consequence of such delaration of war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>The levy of so large an army could only mean war; the power to declare war did not, however, reside in the <rs>President</rs>&mdash;it was delegated to the <rs>Congress</rs> only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>If, however, it had been a riotous combination or an insurrection, it must have been, according to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, against the state; the power of the <rs>President</rs> to call forth the militia to suppress it was dependent upon an application from the state for that purpose; it could not precede such application, and still less could it be rightfully exercised against the will of a state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>The authorities on this subject have been heretofore cited, and need not be referred to again.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>To add that there could be no justification for the invasion of a state by an <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>The question of supplying arms and munitions of war was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> considered, because it was the want for which it was the most difficult to provide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>Of men willing to engage in the defense of their country, there were many more than we could arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>Though the prevailing sentiment of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was a cordial attachment to the <rs>Union</rs> as it was formed by their fathers, their love was for the spirit of the compact, for the liberties it was designed to secure, for the self-government and state sovereignty which had been won by separation from the mother country, and transmitted to them by their Revolutionary sires as a legacy for their posterity forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>The number of those who desired to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>, even though the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be faithfully observed&mdash;those who, in the language of the day, were called <quote>secessionists <hi rend="italics">per se</hi></quote>&mdash;was so small as not to be felt in any popular decision; the number of those who held that the states had surrendered their sovereignty, and had no right to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, was so inappreciably small, if indeed any such existed, that I cannot recall the fact of a single Southern advocate of that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>The assertion of the right is not to be confounded with a readiness to exercise it. Many who had no doubt as to the right, looked upon its exercise with reluctance amounting to sorrow, and claimed that it should be the last resort, only to be adopted as the alternative to a surrender of the equality in the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of states</orgName>, free, sovereign, and independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>Of that class, forming a large majority of the people of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, I may speak with the confidence of <num value="1">one</num> who belonged to it. Thus, after the legislature of <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> had enacted a law for a convention which, representing the sovereignty of the state, should consider the propriety of passing an ordinance to reassume the grants made to the general government, and withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, I, as a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <rs type="role" reg="Senator">Senator</rs> of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, retained my position in the <name>Senate</name>, and sought by every practicable mode to obtain such measures as would allay the excitement and afford to the <rs>South</rs> such security as would prevent the final step, the ordinance of secession from the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>When the last hope of preserving the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was extinguished, and the ordinance of secession was enacted by the convention of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, which was the highest authority known under our form of government, the question of the expediency of adopting that remedy was no longer open to inquiry by <num value="1">one</num> who acknowledged his allegiance as due to the state of which he was a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>To evade the responsibilities resulting from the decree of his sovereign, the people, would be craven; to resist it would be treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>The instincts and affections of the citizens of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> led them with great unanimity to the duty of maintaining and defending their state, without pausing to ask what would be the consequences of refusing obedience to its mandate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>A like feeling pervaded all of the seceding states, and it was not only for the military service, but for every service which would strengthen and sustain the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, that an enthusiasm pervading all classes, sexes, and ages was manifested.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>Though our agricultural products had been mainly for export, insomuch that in the planting states the necessary food supplies were to a considerable extent imported from the <rs>West</rs>, and it would require that the habits of the planters should be changed from the cultivation of staples for export to the production of supplies adequate for home consumption and the support of armies in the field, yet even under the embarrassments of war, this was expected, and for a long time the result justified the expectation, extraordinary as it must appear when viewed by comparison with other people who have been subjected to a like ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>Much of our success was due to the much abused institution of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> servitude, for it enabled the white men to go into the army, and leave the cultivation of their fields and the care of their flocks, as well as of their wives and children, to those who, in the language of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, were <quote>held to service or labor.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>A passing remark may here be appropriate as to the answer thus afforded to the clamor about the <quote>horrors of slavery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/></p> 
<p>Had these Africans been a cruelly oppressed people, restlessly <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> struggling to be freed from their bonds, would their masters have dared to leave them, as was done, and would they have remained as they did, continuing their usual duties, or could the proclamation of emancipation have been put on the plea of a military necessity, if the fact had been that the negroes were forced to serve, and desired only an opportunity to rise against their masters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>It will be remembered that when the proclamation was issued it was confessed by <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0125.0039.00263.00878" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to be a nullity beyond the limit within which it could be enforced by the federal troops.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>As heretofore stated, there was a prevailing belief that there would be no war, or if any, that it would be of very short duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>Therefore the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bill which passed the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">provisional Congress</orgName> provided for receiving troops for short periods&mdash;as my memory serves, for <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>I had urged upon him, in our conference, the adoption of a much longer period, but he assured me that <num value="1">one</num> year was as much as the <rs>Congress</rs> would agree to. On this, as on other occasions, that Congress showed a generous desire to yield their preconceived opinions to my objections as far as they consistently could, and, there being but <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> house, it was easier to change the terms of a bill after conference with the <rs>Executive</rs> than when, under the permanent organization, objections had to be formally communicated in a message to that branch of Congrees in which the bill originated, and when the whole proceeding was of record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act to provide for the public defense became a law on <dateStruct value="1861-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and its <orgName type="regiment" key="5Section">fifth section</orgName> so clearly indicates the opinions and expectations prevailing when the confederation was formed, that it is inserted here: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>It will be seen that the arms and munitions within the limits of the several states were regarded as entirely belonging to them, that the forces which were to constitute the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName> could only be drawn from the several states by their consent, and that these were to be organized under state authority and to be received with their officers so appointed; that the lowest organization was to be that of a company and the highest that of a regiment, and that the appointment of general officers to command these forces was confided to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, should the assembling of large bodies of troops require organization above that of a regiment; it will also be observed that provision was made for the discharge of the forces so provided for, before the term of service fixed by the law. No <num value="1">one</num> will fail to perceive how little was anticipated a war of the vast proportions and great duration which ensued, and how tenaciously the sovereignty and self-government of the states were adhered to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>The hope which was early entertained of a peaceful solution of the issues pending between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> rapidly diminished, so that we find on <dateStruct value="-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6th</day></dateStruct> that the <rs>Congress</rs>, in its preamble to an act to provide for the public defense, begins with the declaration that <quote>in order to provide speedily forces to repel invasion,</quote> etc., authorized the <rs>President</rs> to employ the militia, and to ask for and accept the services of any number of volunteers, not exceeding <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num>, and to organize companies into battalions, battalions into regiments, and regiments into brigades and divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>As in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> law, the <rs>President</rs> was authorized to appoint the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of such brigades and divisions, the commissions to endure only while the brigades were in service.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>On the same day (<dateStruct value="1861-03-06"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>) was enacted the law for the establishment and organization of the army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>, this being in contradistinction to the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName>, which was to be composed of troops tendered by the states, as in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act, and volunteers received, as in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> act, to constitute a <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>That the wish and policy of the government was peace is again manifested in this act, which, in providing for the military establishment of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, fixed the number of enlisted men of all arms at <num value="9420">nine thousand four hundred twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>Due care was taken to prevent the appointment of incompetent or unworthy persons as officers of the army, and the right to promotion up to and including the grade of colonel was carefully guarded; beyond this the professional character of the army was recognized as follows: <quote>Appointments to the rank of brigadier-general, after the army is organized, shall be made by selection from the army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>There being no right of promotion above the grade of colonel in the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>The provision just quoted imposed the further restriction of requiring the person nominated by selection to have previously been an officer of the army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>Regarding the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>Therefore, provision was made for securing to officers who should <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> leave the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>The provisions hereof are in the view entertained that the army was of the states, not of the government, and was to secure to officers adhering to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> the same relative rank which they had before those states had withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>It was clearly the intent of the law to embrace in this provision only those officers who had resigned or who should resign from the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>It is also to be noted that, in the <orgName type="regiment" key="11Section">eleventh section</orgName> of the act to which this was amendatory, the right of promotion up to the grade of colonel, in established regiments and corps, was absolutely secured, but that appointments to the higher grade should be by selection, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> without restriction, but after the army had been organized the selection was confined to the army, thus recognizing the profession of arms, and relieving officers from the hazard, beyond the limit of their legal right to promotion, of being superseded by civilians through favoritism or political influence.</p>

The theory that they owed allegiance to their respective states was founded on the fact that the federal government was of the states; the sequence was that the navy belonged to the states, not to their agent, the federal government; when the states ceased to be united, the naval vessels and armament should have been divided among the owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>While we honor the sentiment which caused them to surrender their heart-bound associations, and the profession to which they were bred, on which they relied for subsistence, to go, with nothing save their swords and faithful hearts, to fight, to bleed, and to die if need be, in defense of their homes and a righteous cause, we can but remember how much was lost by their view of what their honor and duty demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>Far, however, be it from their countrymen, for that or any other consideration, to wish that their fidelity to the dictates of a conscientious belief should have yielded to any temptation of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>The course they pursued shows how impossible it was that they should have done so, for what did they not sacrifice to their sense of right!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>We were doubly bereft by losing our share of the navy we had contributed to build, and by having it all employed to assail us. The application of the appropriations for the navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had been such that the construction of vessels had been at the <rs>North</rs>, though much of the timber used and other material employed was transported from the <rs>South</rs> to Northern shipyards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>Therefore, we were without the accessories needful for the rapid supply of naval vessels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>While attempting whatever was practicable at home, we sent a competent, well-deserving officer of the navy to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to obtain there and elsewhere, by purchase or by building, vessels which could be transformed into ships of war. These efforts and their results will be noticed more fully hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>It may not be amiss to remark here that if the anticipations of our people were not realized, it was not from any lack of the zeal and ability of <persName n="Mallory,Secretary of the Navy,,,," id="n0125.0040.00272.00905" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,S.,R.,,:3"><roleName n="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>As was heretofore stated, his fondness for and aptitude in nautical affairs had led him to know much of vessels, their construction and management, and, as chairman of the <rs>Committee</rs> on <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Naval Affairs, he had superadded to this a very large acquaintance with officers of the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>At the <rs>North</rs> many had been deceived by the fictions of preparations at the <rs>South</rs> for the war of the sections, and among ourselves were few <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> who realized how totally deficient the <rs>Southern</rs> states were in all which was necessary to the active operations of an army, however gallant the men might be, and however able were the generals who directed and led them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>From these causes, operating jointly, resulted undue caution at the <rs>North</rs> and overweening confidence at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>The habits of our people in hunting, and protecting their stock in fields from the ravages of ferocious beasts, caused them to be generally supplied with the arms used for such purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>The facility with which individuals traveled over the country led to very erroneous ideas as to the difficulties of transporting an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>The small amounts of ammunition required in time of peace gave no measure of the amount requisite for warlike operations, and the products of a country which insufficiently supplied food for its inhabitants when peaceful pursuits were uninterrupted, would serve but a short time to furnish the commissariat of a large army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>It was, of course, easy to foresee that if war was waged against the seceding states by all of those which remained in the <rs>Union</rs>, the large supply of provisions which had been annually sent from the <rs>Northwest</rs> to the <rs>South</rs> could not, under the altered circumstances, be relied on. That our people did not more immediately turn their attention to the production of food supplies may be attributed to the prevailing delusion that secession would not be followed by war. To the able officer then at the head of the commissariat department, <persName n="Northrop,Colonel,L.,B.,," id="n0125.0040.00273.00906" reg="default:Northrop,L.,B.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Northrop</surname></persName>, much credit is due for his well-directed efforts to provide both for immediate and prospective wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>It gives me the greater pleasure to say this because those less informed of all he did, and skillfully tried to do, have been profuse in criticism, and sparing indeed of the meed justly his due. Adequate facilities for transportation might have relieved the local want of supplies, especially in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, where the largest bodies of troops were assembled; unfortunately, the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName> was scarcely less provided than that of the commissary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>Not only were the railroads insufficient in number, but they were poorly furnished with rolling stock, and had been mainly dependent upon Northern foundries and factories for their rails and equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>Even the skilled operatives of the railroads were generally Northern men, and their desertion followed fast upon every disaster which attended the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>In addition to other causes which have been mentioned, the idea that cotton was king, and would produce foreign intervention, as well as a desire of the <rs>Northern</rs> people for the return of peace and the restoration of trade, exercised a potent influence in preventing our agriculturists from directing at an early period their capital and labor to the production of food supplies <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> rather than that of our staple for export.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>As <num value="1">one</num> after another the illusions vanished and the material necessities of a great war were recognized by our people, never did patriotic devotion exhibit brighter examples of the sacrifice of self-interest and the abandonment of fixed habits and opinions, or more effective and untiring effort to meet the herculean task which was set before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>Being <num value="1">one</num> of the few who regarded secession and war as inevitably connected, my early attention was given to the organization of military forces and the procurement and preparation of the munitions of war. If our people had not gone to war without counting the cost, they were nevertheless involved in it without means of providing for its necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>It has been heretofore stated that we had no powder mills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>It would be needless to say that the new-born government had no depots of powder, but it may be well to add that, beyond the small supply required for sporting purposes, our local traders had no stock on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>Having no manufacturing industries which required saltpeter, very little of that was purchasable in our markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>The same would have been the case in regard to sulphur but for the fact that it had been recently employed in the clarification of sugar-cane juice, and thus a considerable amount of it was found in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>Prompt measures were taken to secure a supply of sulphur, and parties were employed to obtain saltpeter from the caves, as well as from the earth of old tobacco houses and cellars; artificial niter-beds were made to provide for prospective wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>Of soft wood for charcoal there was abundance, and thus materials were procured for the manufacture of gunpowder to meet the demand which would arise when the limited quantity purchased by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> at the <rs>North</rs> should be exhausted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>It was our good fortune to secure the services of an able and scientific soldier, <persName n="Rains,General,G.,W.,," id="n0125.0040.00274.00907" reg="default:Rains,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName>, who to a military education added experience in a large manufacturing establishment, and to him was confided the construction of a powder mill and the manufacture of powder, both for artillery and small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>The appalling contemplation of the inauguration of a great war, without powder or a navy to secure its importation from abroad, was soon relieved by the extraordinary efforts of the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> and the well-directed skill of <persName n="Rains,General,,,," id="n0125.0040.00274.00908" reg="nearbymention:Rains,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName>, to whom it is but a just tribute to say that, beginning without even instructed workmen, he had before the close of the war made what, in the opinion of competent judges, has been pronounced the best powder mill in the world, and in which powder of every variety of grain was <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> manufactured of materials which had been purified from those qualities which cause its deterioration under long exposure to a moist atmosphere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>The avowed purpose and declared obligation of the federal government was to occupy and possess the property belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, yet <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts was to set fire to the armory at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harpers Ferry, Virginia</placeName>, the only establishment of the kind in the <rs>Southern</rs> states, and the only Southern depository of the rifles which the general government had then on hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>What conclusion is to be drawn from such action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>To avoid attributing a breach of solemn pledges, it must be supposed that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was considered as out of the <rs>Union</rs>, and a public enemy, in whose borders it was proper to destroy whatever might be useful to her of the common property of the states lately united.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>As soon as the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> had evacuated the place, the citizens and amorers went to work to save the armory as far as possible from destruction, and to secure valuable material stored in it. The master <persName n="Ball,Armorer,Armistead,,," id="n0125.0040.00275.00909" reg="default:Ball,Armistead,,,"><roleName n="Armorer">armorer</roleName>, <foreName>Armistead</foreName> <surname>Ball</surname></persName>, so bravely and skillfully directed these efforts that a large part of the machinery and materials was saved from the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>The subduing of the fire was a dangerous and difficult task, and great credit is due to those who, under the orders of <persName n="Ball,Master,Armorer,,," id="n0125.0040.00275.00910" reg="default:Ball,Armorer,,,"><roleName n="Master">Master</roleName> <foreName>Armorer</foreName> <surname>Ball</surname></persName>, attempted and achieved it. When the fire was extinguished, the work was continued and persevered in until all the valuable machinery and material had been collected, boxed, and shipped to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, about the end of the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>The machinery thus secured was divided between the arsenals at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville, North Carolina</placeName>, and when repaired and put in working condition, supplied to some extent the want which existed in the <rs>South</rs> of means for the alteration and repair of old or injured arms, and finally contributed to increase the very scanty supply of arms with which our country was furnished when the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>The practice of the federal government, which had kept the construction and manufacture of the material of war at the <rs>North</rs>, had consequently left the <rs>South</rs> without the requisite number of skilled workmen by whose labor machinery could at once be made fully effective if it were obtained; indeed, the want of such employees prevented the small amount of machinery on hand from being worked to its full capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>The gallant <persName n="Ball,Master,Armorer,,," id="n0125.0040.00275.00911" reg="default:Ball,Armorer,,,"><roleName n="Master">Master</roleName> <foreName>Armorer</foreName> <surname>Ball</surname></persName>, whose capacity, zeal, and fidelity deserve more than a passing notice, was sent with that part of the machinery assigned to the <orgName n="Fayetteville Arsenal" type="arsenal">Fayetteville arsenal</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>The toil, the anxiety, and responsibility of his perilous position at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harpers Ferry</placeName>, where he remained long after the protecting force of the <rs>Confederate</rs> <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> army retired, had probably undermined a constitution so vigorous that, in the face of a great exigency, no labor seemed too great or too long for him to grapple with and endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>So, like a ship which, after having weathered the storm, goes down in the calm, the master armorer, soon after he took his quiet post at <placeName key="tgn,7014292" n="1.000 5" reg="fayetteville, cumberland, north carolina">Fayetteville</placeName>, was <quote>found dead in his bed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>In the progress of this work, it is hoped, will be presented not only the magnitude of the obstacles, but the spirit and capacity with which they were encountered by the unseen and much undervalued labors of the officers of the several departments, on whom devolved provision for the civil service, as well as for the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>To justify himself to Congress and the people, or rather, before the face of mankind, for this evasion of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of his country, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0125.0041.00279.00919" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in his message to Congress of <dateStruct value="1861-07-04"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, resorted to the artifice of saying, <quote>It [meaning the proceedings of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>] presents to the whole family of man the question whether a constitutional republic or democracy&mdash;a government of the people by the same people&mdash;can, or can not, maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/></p> 
<p>The answer to this question is very plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>In the nature of things, no union can be formed except by separate, independent, and distinct parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>Any other combination is not a union; upon the destruction of any of these elements in the parties, the union <hi rend="italics">ipso facto</hi> ceases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>If the government is the result of a <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of states</orgName>, then these states must be separate, sovereign, and distinct, to be able to form a union, which is entirely an act of their own volition.

<p><rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, preamble.</p></note> Any departure from this principle by the general government not only perverts and destroys its nature, but furnishes a just cause <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> to the injured state to withdraw from the union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>A new union might subsequently be formed, but the original <num value="1">one</num> could never by coercion be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>Any effort on the part of the others to force the seceding state to consent to come back is an attempt at subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>It is a wrong which no lapse of time or combination of circumstances can ever make right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>A forced union is a political absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>No less absurd is <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0125.0041.00280.00920" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s effort to dissever the sovereignty of the people from that of the state; as if there could be a state without a people, or a sovereign people without a state.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>But the question which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0125.0041.00280.00921" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> presents <quote>to the whole family of man</quote> deserves a further notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>The answer which he seems to infer would be given <quote>by the whole family of man</quote> is that such a government as he supposes <quote>can maintain its territorial integrity against its own domestic foes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>And therefore he concluded that he was right in the judgment of <quote>the whole family of man</quote> in commencing hostilities against us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>That is the power to make war against foreign nations, for the government has no other war power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Planting himself on this position, he commenced the devastation and bloodshed which followed to effect our subjugation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>Nothing could be more erroneous than such views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>The supposed case which he presents is entirely unlike the real case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>The government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is like no other government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>It is an anomaly among governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/></p> 
<p>The beginning and the end of all the powers of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are to be found in that instrument of delegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>But this which he asserts is not a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>Let the reader turn to the record of the facts in Part <num value="3">III</num> of this work, and peruse the fruitless efforts for peace which were made by us, and which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0125.0041.00281.00923" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> did not deign to notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>The assertion is not only incorrect in stating that force was employed by us, but also in declaring that it was for the destruction of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>On the contrary, we wished to leave it alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>He now goes to the <rs>Constitution</rs> for the exercise of his war power, and here we have another fiction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>It further declared that all persons who should under their authority molest any vessel of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or the persons or cargo on board, should be treated as pirates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>In their efforts to subjugate us, the destruction of our commerce was regarded by the authorities at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> as a most efficient measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>It was early seen that, although acts of Congress established ports of entry where commerce existed, they might be repealed, and the ports nominally closed or declared to be closed; yet such a declaration would be of no avail unless sustained by a naval force, as these ports were located in territory not subject to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>An act was subsequently passed authorizing the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in his direction, to close our ports, but it was never executed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>The scheme of blockade was resorted to, and a falsehood was asserted on which to base it. <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n0125.0041.00281.00926" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:4"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> writes to <persName n="Dallas,,,,," id="n0125.0041.00281.00927" reg="mostcommon:Dallas,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Dallas</surname></persName>: <quote>You will say (to <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n0125.0041.00281.00928" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>) that, by our own laws and the laws of nature and the laws of nations, this Government has a clear right to suppress insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>Under the laws of nations, separate governments when at war blockade each other's ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>This is decided to be justifiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>But the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could not consent to justify its blockade of our ports on this ground, as it would be an admission that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were a separate and distinct sovereignty, and that the war was prosecuted only for subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>It therefore assumed that the withdrawal of the <rs>Southern</rs> states from the <rs>Union</rs> was an insurrection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>Was it an insurrection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>When certain sovereign and independent states form a union with limited powers for some general purposes, and any <num value="1">one</num> or more of them, in the progress of time, suffer unjust and oppressive grievances for which there is no redress but in a withdrawal from the association, is such withdrawal an insurrection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>If so, then of what advantage is a compact of union to states?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>Within the <rs>Union</rs> are oppressions and grievances; the attempt to go out brings war and subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>The ambitious and aggressive states obtain possession of the central authority which, having grown strong in the lapse of time, asserts its entire sovereignty over the states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>Whichever of them denies it and seeks to retire is declared to be guilty of insurrection, its citizens are stigmatized as <quote>rebels,</quote> as if they had revolted against a master, and a war of subjugation is begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>If the doctrines thus announced by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are conceded, then look through either end of the political telescope, and <num value="1">one</num> sees only an empire, and the once famous <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi> trodden in the dust as a <quote>glittering generality,</quote> and the compact of union denounced as a <quote>flaunting lie.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>Such must be the verdict of mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>Men do not fight to make a fraternal union, neither do nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>These military preparations of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> signified nothing less than the subjugation of the <rs>Southern</rs> states, so that, by <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> devastating blow, the <rs>North</rs> might grasp forever that supremacy it had so long coveted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>To be prepared for self-defense, I called Congress together at <placeName key="tgn,7013928" n="1.000 4" reg="montgomery, montgomery, alabama">Montgomery</placeName> on <dateStruct value="-04-29"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="29">29th</day></dateStruct>, and in the message of that date, thus spoke of the proclamation of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>: <quote>Apparently contradictory as are the terms of this singular document, <num value="1">one</num> point is unmistakably evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>Meantime, being deprived of the aid of Congress, I had been under the necessity of confining my action to a call on the states for volunteers for the common defense, in accordance with authority previously conferred on me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>Finally, that the intent of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, already developed, to invade our soil, capture our forts, blockade our ports, and wage war against us, rendered it necessary to raise means to a much larger amount than had been done, to defray the expenses of maintaining independence and repelling invasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>A brief summary of the internal affairs of the government followed, and notwithstanding frequent declarations of the peaceful intentions of the withdrawing states had been made in the most solemn manner, it was deemed not to be out of place to repeat them once more; therefore, the message closed with these words: <quote>We protest solemnly, in the face of mankind, that we desire peace at any sacrifice, save that of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3608"/>As we approached <orgName n="Manassas Railroad" type="railroad">Manassas railroad</orgName> junction, a cloud of dust was visible a short distance to the west of the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>It was, however, subsequently learned that the dust was raised by a number of wagons which had been sent to the rear for greater security against the contingencies of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>There were, however, many who turned back, and the wounded generally cheered upon meeting us.

<p>On the extreme left of our field of operations I found the troops whose opportune arrival had averted impending disaster, and had so materially contributed to our victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>Some of them had, after arriving at the <orgName n="Manassas Railroad" type="railroad">Manassas railroad</orgName> junction, hastened to our left; their brigadier general, <persName n="Smith,,E.,K.,," id="n0125.0043.00305.01062" reg="default:Smith,E.,K.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>K.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, was wounded soon after getting into action, and the command of the brigade devolved upon <persName n="Elzy,,,,," id="n0125.0043.00305.01063" reg="mostcommon:Elzy,nomatch:0"><surname>Elzy</surname></persName>, by whom it was gallantly and skillfully led to the close of the battle; others, under the command of General (then <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>) <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0125.0043.00305.01064" reg="mostcommon:Early,J.,A.,,:3"><surname>Early</surname></persName>, made a rapid march, under the pressing necessity, from the extreme right of our line to and beyond our left, so as to attack the enemy in flank, thus inflicting on him the discomfiture his oblique movement was designed to inflict on us. All these troops and the others near to them had hastened into action without supplies or camp equipage; weary, hungry, and without shelter, night closed around them where they stood, the blood-stained victors on a hard-fought field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>It was reported to me that some of the troops had been so long <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> without food as to be suffering severe hunger, and that no supplies could be got where they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>I made several addresses to them, all to the effect that their position was that best adapted to a pursuit of the enemy, and that they should therefore remain there; I added that I would go to headquarters and direct that supplies be sent to them promptly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>I rode to see him, and found him in severe pain; from the twitching, visible and frequent, he seemed to be threatened with tetanus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>A man sat beside him whose uniform was that of the enemy; he was gentle, however, and appeared to be solicitously attentive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>He said that he had no morphine, and did not know where to get any.

I took the name and the state of the supposed good Samaritan, and at army headquarters directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>The sequel will be told hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>It was then late, and we rode back in the night, say <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>, to the army headquarters.

At a later hour when I met <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0125.0043.00306.01070" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and informed him of what had occurred, he stated that, because of a false alarm which had reached him, he had ordered the troops referred to from the left to the right of our line, so as to be in position to repel the reported movement of the enemy against that flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>That such an alarm should have been credited, and a night march ordered on account of it, shows how little the completeness of the victory was realized. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>Impressed with the belief that the enemy was very superior to us, both in numbers and appointments, I had felt apprehensive that, unless <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> pressed, he would recover from the panic under which he fled from the field, rally on his reserves, and renew the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>Therefore it was that I immediately felt the necessity for a pursuit of the fugitives, and insisted that the troops on the extreme left should retain their position during the night of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, as has been heretofore stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/>In conference with the generals that night, this subject was considered, and I dictated an order for a movement on the rear of the enemy at early dawn, which, on account of the late hour at which it was given, differed very little from <num value="1">one</num> for an immediate movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>A rainfall, extraordinary for its violence and duration, occurred on the morning of the succeeding day, so that, over places where during the battle <num value="1">one</num> could scarcely get a drink of water, rolled torrents which, in the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, it was difficult to cross.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>From these and other causes, the troops were scattered to such an extent that but few commands could have been assembled for immediate service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>It was well for us that the enemy, instead of retiring in order, so as to be rallied and again brought to the attack, left hope behind and fled in dismay to seek for safety beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>The roll need not be recorded here; it has a more enduring depository than the pen can make&mdash;the traditions of a grateful people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>The victory at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was certainly extraordinary, not only on account of the disparity of numbers and the inferiority of our arms, but also because of many other disadvantages under which we labored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>We had no disciplined troops, and though our citizens were generally skilled in the use of small arms, which, with their high pride and courage, might compensate for the want of training while in position, these inadequately substituted military instruction when manoeuvres had to be performed under fire, and could not make the old-fashioned musket equal to the long-range, new-model muskets with which the enemy was supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>The disparity in artillery was still greater, both in the number and kind of guns; thanks to the skill and cool courage of <persName n="Pendleton,Reverend,Captain,W.,N.," id="n0125.0044.00311.01118" reg="default:Pendleton,Captain,W.,N.,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Reverend</roleName> <foreName>Captain</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, his battery of light, smooth-bore guns, manned principally by the youths whose rector he had been, proved more effective in battle than the long-range rifle-guns of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>The character of the ground brought the forces into close contact, and the ricochet of the round balls carried havoc into the columns of the enemy, while the bolts of their rifle-guns, if they missed their object, penetrated harmlessly into the ground.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>To all this must be added the disturbing fact that the plan of battle, as originally designed, was entirely changed by the movement of the enemy on our extreme left, instead of right and center, as anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>The operations, therefore, had to be conducted against the plan of the enemy, instead of on that which our generals had prepared and explained to their subordinate commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>The promptitude with which the troops moved, and the readiness with which our generals modified their preconceived plans to meet the necessities as they were developed, entitled them to the commendation so liberally bestowed at the time by their countrymen at large.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>The supplies of the army were on a scale of such luxurious extravagance as to excite the surprise of those accustomed only to our rigid economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>The anticipation of an easy victory had caused many to come to the battle as to a joyous feast, and the signs left behind them of the extent to which they had been disappointed in the entertainment, constituted the staple of many laughable stories, which were not without their value because of the lesson they contained as to the uncertainties of war and the mortification that usually follows vain boasting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>On the night of the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> I held a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> conference with <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00312.01123" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00312.01124" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>The large amount gained of fine artillery, small arms, and ammunition, all of which were much needed by us, was not the least gratifying consequence of our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>The generals, like myself, were well content with what had been done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>I propounded to them the inquiry as to what more it was practicable to do. They concurred as to their inability to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and to the further inquiry as to an advance to the south side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00313.01125" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> promptly stated that there were strong fortifications there, occupied by garrisons, which had not been in the battle, and were therefore not affected by the panic which had seized the defeated army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>He described those fortifications as having wide, deep ditches, with palisades, which would prevent the escalade of the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>Turning to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00313.01126" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, he said, <quote>They have spared no expense.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>It was further stated in explanation that we had no sappers and miners, nor even the tools requisite to make regular approaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>If we had possessed both, the time required for such operations would have more than sufficed for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Patterson,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00313.01127" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,William,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> and other forces to have been brought to that locality in such numbers as must have rendered the attempt, with our present means, futile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>This view of the matter rests on the supposition that the fortifications and garrisons described did actually exist, of which there seemed then to be no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>If the reports which have since reached us be true, that there were at that time neither fortifications nor troops stationed on the south bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>; that all the enemy's forces fled to the north side of the river, and even beyond; that the panic of the routed army infected the whole population of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>; that no preparation was made, or even contemplated, for the destruction of the bridge across the <rs>Potomac</rs>&mdash;then it may have been, as many have asserted, that our army, following close upon the flying enemy, could have entered and taken possession of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>These reports, however, present a condition of affairs altogether at variance with the information on which we had to act. Thus it was, and so far as I knew, for the reasons above stated, that an advance to the south bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName> was not contemplated as the immediate sequence of the victory at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>What discoveries would have been made and what results would have ensued from the establishment of our guns upon the south bank of the river, to open fire upon the capital, are speculative questions upon which it would be useless to enter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>After the conference of the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>, and because of it, I decided to return <pb id="p.314" n="314"/> to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and employ all the power of my office to increase the strength of the army, so as to better enable it to meet the public need, whether in offensive-defensive or purely defensive operations, as opportunity should offer for the <num value="1">one</num>, or the renewal of invasion require the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>A short time subsequent to my return, a message was brought to me from the prison, to the effect that a noncommissioned officer, captured at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, claimed to have a promise of protection from me. The name given was <persName n="Hulburt,,,,," id="n0125.0044.00314.01128" reg="mostcommon:Hulburt,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Hulburt</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>I had forgotten the name he gave when I saw him; but, believing that I would recognize the person who had attended to <persName n="Gardner,Colonel,,,," id="n0125.0044.00314.01129" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName>, and to whom only such a promise had been given, the officer in charge was directed to send him to me. When he came, I had no doubt of his identity, and explained to him that I had directed that he should not be treated as a prisoner, but that, in the multitude of those wearing the same uniform as his, some neglect or mistake had arisen, for which I was very sorry, and that he should be immediately released and sent down the river to the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, where he would be among his own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>He then told me that he had a sister residing a few miles in the country, whom he would be very glad to visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>Permission was given him to do so, and a time fixed at which he was to report for transportation; so he left, with manifestations of thankfulness for the kindness with which he had been treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>In due time a newspaper was received, containing an account of his escape, and how he had lingered about the suburbs of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and made drawings of the surrounding fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>The treachery was as great as if his drawings had been valuable, which they could not have been, as we had only then commenced the detached works which were designed as a system of defenses for <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>When the smoke of battle had lifted from the field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and the rejoicing over the victory had spread over the land and spent its exuberance, some who, like <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>'s war horse, <quote>sniffed the battle from afar,</quote> but in whom the likeness there ceased, censoriously asked why the fruits of the victory had not been gathered by the capture of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>Then some indiscreet friends of the generals commanding in that battle, instead of the easier task of justification, chose the harder <num value="1">one</num> of exculpation for the imputed failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>Their ill-advised zeal, combined perhaps with malice against me, induced the allegation that the <rs>President</rs> had prevented the generals from making an immediate and vigorous pursuit of the routed enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>This, as other stories had been, was left to the correction which time <pb id="p.315" n="315"/> it was hoped would bring, the sooner because it was expected to be refuted by the reports of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding generals</rs> with whom I had conferred on that subject immediately after the battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>After considerable time had elapsed, it was reported to me that a member of Congress, who had served on that occasion as a volunteer aide to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00315.01130" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, had stated in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> that I had prevented the pursuit of the enemy after his defeat at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>To the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question I reply, No. The pursuit was <quote>obstructed</quote> by the enemy's troops at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, as I have stated in my official report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>In that report I have also said why no advance was made upon the enemy's capital (for reasons) as follows: <pb id="p.316" n="316"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>The apparent freshness of the <orgName n="U. S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>To the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> question I reply that it has never been feasible for the army to advance farther than it has done&mdash;to the line of <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>, with its advanced posts at <persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n0125.0044.00316.01136" reg="mostcommon:Upton,nomatch:0"><surname>Upton</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Munson,,,,," id="n0125.0044.00316.01137" reg="mostcommon:Munson,nomatch:0"><surname>Munson</surname></persName>'s, and <placeName reg="Mason's Hills">Mason's Hills</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3774"/>No specific inquiry was made by me as to the part I took in the conferences of <dateStruct value="-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, but a general reference was made to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3775"/>The entire silence of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00316.01139" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> in regard to those conferences is noticeable from the fact that, while his answer was strictly measured by the terms of my inquiry as to pursuit, he added a statement about a conference at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court House">Fairfax Court House</placeName>, which occurred in the autumn, say <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, and could have had no relation to the question of pursuit of the enemy after the victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, or other active operations therewith connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>The reasons stated in my letter for making an inquiry naturally pointed to the conferences of <dateStruct value="-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, but surely not to a conference held months subsequent to the battle, and on a question quite different from that of hot pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>In regard to the matter of this subsequent conference I shall have more to say hereafter.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3779"/>Anxious to recognize the claim of the army on the gratitude of the country, it was my pleasing duty to bear testimony to their merit in every available form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3780"/>Those who left the field and did not return to share its glory, it was wished, should only be remembered as exceptions proving a rule.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3782"/>It would have seemed to me then, as it does now, to be less than was due to the energy and fortitude of our troops, to plead a want of transportation and supplies for a march of about <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> through a country which had not then been denuded by the ravages of war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>my dear sir: . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>Under the circumstances of our army, in the absence of the knowledge since acquired, if indeed the statements be true, it would have been extremely hazardous to have done more than was performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3787"/>You will not fail to remember that, so far from knowing that the enemy was routed, a large part of our forces was moved by you, in the night of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st</day></dateStruct>, to repel a supposed attack upon our right, and that the next day's operations did not fully reveal what has since been reported of the enemy's panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>Enough was done for glory, and the measure of duty was full; let us rather show the untaught that their desires are unreasonable, than, by dwelling on possibilities recently developed, give form and substance to the criticisms always easy to those who judge after the event.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>With much surprise I found that the newspaper statements were sustained by the text of your report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>I was surprised, because, if we did differ in opinion as to the measure and purposes of contemplated campaigns, such fact could have no appropriate place in the report of a battle; further, because it seemed to be an attempt to exalt yourself at my expense; and, especially, because no such plan as that described was submitted to me. It is true that, some time before it was ordered, you expressed a desire for the junction of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0044.00318.01154" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> with your own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/>The Congress, in its discretion, ordered the publication of the report, <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> except that part to which the endorsement referred, thereby judiciously suppressing both the endorsement and the portion of the report to which it related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>Recently a military force has been enlisted and quartered by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities within this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>The people of this State desire to be free from the presence of the soldiers of either belligerent, and to that end my efforts are now directed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/></p> 
<p>In reply to this request, I lose no time in assuring you that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> neither desires nor intends to disturb the neutrality of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>That such apprehensions were not groundless has been proved by the course of that Government in the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and more recently in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> itself, in which, as you inform me, <quote>a military force has been enlisted and quartered by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/></p> 
<p>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has not only respected most scrupulously the neutrality of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, but has continued to maintain the friendly relations of trade and intercourse which it has suspended with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> generally.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>But neutrality, to be entitled to respect, must be strictly maintained between both parties; or, if the door be opened on the <num value="1">one</num> side for the aggressions of <num value="1">one</num> of the belligerent parties upon the other, it ought not to be shut to the assailed when they seek to enter it for purposes of self-defense.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>During the days this order was held for his removal, with discretionary power to deliver or withhold it, the above-recited events occurred, and they may fairly be considered as having decided the question of his removal from that command.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>To whom did those arms belong?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>Certainly to those whose money had made or purchased them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>That is, to the states in common, not to their agent the general government, or to a portion of the states which might be in a condition to appropriate them to their special use, and in disregard of the rights of their partners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>Not satisfied with removing the public arms from the limits of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, the next step was that, in total disrespect of the constitutional right of the citizens to bear arms for their own defense, and to be free from searches and seizures except by warrants duly issued, the officers of the general government proceeded to search the houses of citizens in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and to seize arms wherever they were found.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>It will be remembered that <persName n="Jackson,Governor,,,," id="n0125.0046.00360.01472" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,T.,J.,,:4"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had responded to the call of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0125.0046.00360.01473" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> upon him for troops with the just indignation of <num value="1">one</num> who understood the rights of the state, and the limited powers of the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>The people generously confided in the disposition of the general government to observe their rights, and continued to hope for a peaceful settlement of the questions then agitating the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>This was evinced by the fact that not a single secessionist was elected to the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">state convention</orgName>, and that <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n0125.0046.00361.01476" reg="nearbymention:Price,sterling,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, an avowed <quote>Union man,</quote> was chosen as president of the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>It has been shown that the <rs>Southern</rs> states, by their representatives in the <num value="2">two</num> houses of Congress, consistently endeavored, even to the last day when they were by their constituents permitted to remain in the halls of federal legislation, to maintain the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and preserve the union which the states had by their independent action ordained and established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>On the other hand, proof has been adduced to show that the <rs>Northern</rs> states, by a majority of their representatives in the <rs>Congress</rs>, had persisted in agitation injurious to the welfare and tranquillity of the <rs>Southern</rs> states, and at the last moment had refused to make any concessions, or to offer any guarantees to check the current toward secession of the complaining states, whose love for the <rs>Union</rs> rendered them willing to accept less than justice should have readily accorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>The issue was then presented between submission to empire of the <rs>North</rs>, or the severance of those ties consecrated by many memories, and strengthened by those habits which render every people reluctant to sever long-existing associations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>The authorities heretofore cited have, I must believe, conclusively shown that the question of changing their government was <num value="1">one</num> that the states had the power to decide by virtue of the unalienable right announced in the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs></hi>, and which had been proudly denominated the <rs>American</rs> idea of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>The hope and the wish of the people of the <rs>South</rs> were that the disagreeable necessity of separation would be peacefully met, and be followed by such commercial regulations as would least disturb the prosperity and future intercourse of the separated states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>Every step taken by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> was directed toward that end. The separation of the states having been decided on, it was sought to effect it in such manner as would be just <pb id="p.379" n="379"/> to the parties concerned, and preserve as far as possible, under separate governments, the fraternal and mutually beneficial relations which had existed between the states when united, and which it was the object of their compact of union to secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>To all the proofs heretofore offered I confidently refer for the establishment of the fact that whatever of bloodshed, of devastation, or shock to republican government has resulted from the war, is to be charged to the <rs>Northern</rs> states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>The invasions of the <rs>Southern</rs> states, for purposes of coercion, were in violation of the written Constitution, and the attempt to subjugate sovereign states, under the pretext of <quote>preserving the <rs>Union</rs>,</quote> was alike offensive to law, to good morals, and the proper use of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>The Union was the voluntary junction of free and independent states; to subjugate any of them was to destroy constituent parts, and necessarily, therefore, must be the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs> itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>That the <rs>Southern</rs> states were satisfied with a federal government such as their fathers had formed was shown by their adoption of a Constitution so little differing from the instrument of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>It was against the violations of that instrument, and usurpations offensive to their pride and injurious to their interests, that they remonstrated, argued, and finally appealed to the inherent, undelegated power of the states to judge of their wrongs, and of the <quote>mode and measure of redress.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/></p> 
<p>After many years of fruitless effort to secure from their Northern associates a faithful observance of the compact of union; after its conditions had been deliberately and persistently broken, and the signs of the times indicated further and more ruthless violations of their rights as equals in the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Southern</rs> states, preferring a peaceful separation to continuance in a hostile Union, decided to exercise their sovereign right to withdraw from an association which had failed to answer the ends for which it was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>It has been shown how they endeavored to effect the change with strict regard to the principles controlling a dissolution of partnership, and how earnestly they desired to remain in friendly relations to the <rs>Northern</rs> states, and how all their overtures were rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>When they pleaded for peace, the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>It has been shown <pb id="p.380" n="380"/> how her efforts to check dissolution were persisted in when the aggrieved were hopeless and the aggressors reckless, and how her mediations were rejected in the <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">Peace Congress</orgName> which on her motion had been assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>Sorrowing over the failure of this, her blessed though unsuccessful attempt to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, she was not permitted to mourn as a neutral, but was required by the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>Having exhausted all other means, she took the last resort, and, if for this she was selected as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object of assault, <quote>methinks the punishment exceedeth the offense.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/></p> 
<p>The large resources and full preparation of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States government</orgName> enabled it to girt <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> as with a wall of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>It has been shown that she was threatened from the east, from the north, and from the west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>The capital of the state and of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, was the objective point, and on this the march of <num value="3">three</num> columns concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>On the east the advance of the enemy was on several occasions feasible, when we consider the number of his forces at and about <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, in comparison with the small means retained for the defense of the capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>On the north the most formidable army of the enemy was assembled; to oppose it we had the comparatively small <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>This being regarded as the line on which the greatest danger was apprehended, our efforts were mostly directed toward giving it the requisite strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>Troops, as rapidly as they could be raised and armed, were sent forward for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>From the beginning to the close of the war, we mainly relied for the defense of the capital on its aged citizens, boys too young for service, and the civil employees of the executive departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>On several occasions these were called out to resist an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>They answered with alacrity, and always bore themselves gallantly, more than once repelling the enemy in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>Had it been practicable to do so, it would surely have been proper to keep a large force in reserve for the defense of the capital, so often and vauntingly <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> proclaimed to be the object of the enemy's campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4567"/>Perhaps the propriety of such provision gave currency and credence to rumors that we had a large force at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4568"/>This even led to the application for a detachment from it to reenforce our <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, which caused me to write to <persName n="Johnston,General,J.,E.,," id="n0125.0048.00381.01615" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas, Virginia</placeName>, on <dateStruct value="1861-09-05"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="5">5</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>Then, there, and everywhere, our difficulty was the want of arms and munitions of war. Lamentable cries came to us from the <rs>West</rs> for the supplies which would enable patriotic citizens to defend their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>The resource upon which the people had so confidently relied, the private arms in the hands of citizens, proved a sad delusion, and elsewhere it has been shown how deficient we were in ammunition, or the means of providing it. The simple fact, was, the country had gone to war without counting the cost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>Undue elation over our victory at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was followed by dissatisfaction at what was termed the failure to reap the fruits of victory; rumors, for which there could be no better excuse than partisan zeal, were circulated that the heroes of the hour were prevented from reaping the fruits of the victory by the interference of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/>Naturally there followed another rumor, that the inaction of the victorious army, to which reenforcements continued to be sent, was due to the policy of the <rs>President</rs>; he also was held responsible, and with more apparent justice, for the failure to organize the troops of the several states, as the law contemplated, into brigades and divisions composed of the soldiers of each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>Though these unjust criticisms weakened the power of the government to meet its present and provide for its future necessities, I bore them in silence, lest to vindicate myself should injure the public service by turning the public censure to the generals on whom the hopes of the country rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4577"/>That motive no longer exists; to justify the faith of those who, without a defense, continued to uphold my hands, I propose to set forth the facts by correspondence and otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4578"/>So far as, in doing <pb id="p.382" n="382"/> this, blame shall be transferred from me to others, it will be the incident, not the design, as it would be most gratifying to me only to notice for praise each and all who wore the gray.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4579"/>The fiction of my having prevented the pursuit of the enemy after the victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was exploded after it had acquired an authoritative and semiofficial form in the manner and for the reasons heretofore set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4580"/>It only remains, therefore, to notice the other points indicated above:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, the organization of the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4582"/>Disease and discontent are known to be the attendants of armies lying unemployed in camps, especially, as in our case, when the troops were composed of citizens called from their homes under the idea of a pressing necessity, and with the hope of soon returning to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4583"/>Our citizen soldiers were a powerful political element, and their correspondence, finding its way to the people through the press and to the halls of Congress by direct communication with the members, was felt, by its influence both upon public opinion and general legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4584"/>Members of Congress, and notably the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>, contended that men should be allowed to go home and attend to their private affairs while there were no active operations, and that there was no doubt but that they would return whenever there was to be a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4585"/>The experience of war soon taught our people the absurdity of such ideas, and before its close probably none would have uttered them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4586"/>There were very many men out of the army who were anxious to enter it, but for whom we had not arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4587"/>This gave rise to the remark, more humorous than profound, that we <quote>stood around the camps with clubs to keep <num value="1">one</num> set in and another set out.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4588"/>Had this been true, it was certainly justifiable to refuse to exchange a trained man for a recruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4589"/>All who have seen service know that <num value="1">one</num> old soldier is, in campaign, equal to several who have everything of military life to learn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4590"/>A marked characteristic of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was individuality, and time was needful to teach them that the terrible machine, a disciplined army, must be made of men who had surrendered their freedom of will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4591"/>The most distinguished of our citizens were not the slowest to learn the lessons, and perhaps no army ever more thoroughly knew it than did that which <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0125.0048.00382.01616" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> led into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and none ever had a leader who in his own conduct better illustrated the lesson.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4592"/>Our largest army in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was that of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4593"/>It had been formed by the junction of the forces under <persName n="Johnston,General,J.,E.,," id="n0125.0048.00382.01617" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> with those under <persName n="Beauregard,General,P.,G.,T.," id="n0125.0048.00382.01618" reg="default:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, with such additions as could <pb id="p.383" n="383"/> be hurriedly sent forward to meet the enemy on the field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>They were combined into brigades and divisions as pressing exigencies required.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4595"/>By the act of <dateStruct value="1861-02-28"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>President</rs> was authorized to receive companies, battalions, and regiments to form a part of the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName>, and, with the advice and consent of Congress, to appoint general officers for them; by the act of <dateStruct value="-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6th</day></dateStruct> the <rs>President</rs> was to apportion the staff and general officers among the respective states from which the volunteers were received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4596"/>It will thus be seen that the states generously surrendered their right to preserve for those volunteers the character of state troops and to appoint general officers when furnishing a sufficient number of regiments to require such grade for their command; in giving their volunteers to form the <orgName n="Provisional Army" type="misc">provisional army</orgName> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it was distinctly suggested that the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> should be so appointed as to make a just apportionment among the states furnishing the troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4597"/>During the repose which followed the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, it was deemed proper that the regiments of the different states should be assembled in brigades together, and, as far as consistent with the public service, that the spirit of the law should be complied with by the assignment of brigadier generals of the same state from which the troops were drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4598"/>Instructions to that end were therefore given, and again and again repeated, but were for a long time only partially complied with, until the delay formed the basis of the argument that those who had by association become thoroughly acquainted would more advantageously be left united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>In the meantime, frequent complaints came to me from the army, of unjust discrimination, the law being executed in regard to the troops of some states but not of others, and of serious discontent arising therefrom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4600"/>The duty to obey the law was imperative, and neither the executive nor the officers of the army had any right to question its propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4601"/>I, however, considered the policy of that law wise, and was not surprised when it was stated to me that the persistent obstruction to its execution was repressing the spirit to volunteer in places to which complaints of such supposed favoritism had been transmitted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4602"/>About <dateStruct value="-10-1"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct>, at the request of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00383.01619" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, I went to his headquarters, at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court House">Fairfax Court House</placeName>, for the purpose of conference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4603"/>At the time of this visit to the army, the attention of the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>, who then met me in conference, was called to the obligation created by law to organize the troops, when the numbers tendered by <pb id="p.384" n="384"/> any state permitted it, into brigades and divisions composed of the regiments, battalions, or companies of such state, and to assign general and staff officers in the ratio of the troops thus received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4604"/>After my return to the capital, the importance of the subject weighed so heavily upon me as to lead to correspondence with the generals, which will be best understood by the following extracts from my letters to them which are here appended: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>If the volunteers continue their complaints that they are commanded by strangers and do not get justice, and that they are kept in camp to die when reported for hospital by the surgeon, we shall soon feel a reaction in the matter of volunteering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>. . . I have thought often upon the questions of reorganization which were submitted to you, and it has seemed to me that whether in view of disease, or the disappointment and suffering of a winter cantonment on a line of defense, or of a battle to be fought in and near your position, it was desirable to combine the troops, by a new distribution, with as little delay as practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>They will be stimulated to extraordinary effort when so organized, in that the fame of their State will be in their keeping, and that each will feel that his immediate commander will desire to exalt rather than diminish his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>The spirit of our military law is manifested in the fact that the <rs>State</rs> organization was limited to the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>The volunteers come in sufficient numbers to have brigadiers, but have only colonels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>It was not then intended (is the necessary conclusion) that those troops should be under the <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> command of officers above the grade of colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>The spirit of the law, then, indicates that brigades should be larger than customary, the general being charged with the care, the direction, the preservation of the men, rather than the internal police.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/><num value="1">1</num>. As far as practicable, to keep regiments from the same State together; <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>To assign generals to command the troops of their own State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>I have not overlooked the objections to each, but the advantages are believed to outweigh the disadvantages of that arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>In distributing the regiments of the several States it would, I think, be better to place the regiments for the war in the same brigade of the <rs>State</rs>, and assign to those brigades the brigadiers whose services could least easily be dispensed with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>For this, among other reasons, I will mention but <num value="1">one</num>: the commission of a brigadier expires upon the breaking up of his brigade (see the law for their appointment). Of course, I would not for slight cause change the relations of troops and commanders, especially where it has been long continued and endeared by the trials of battle; but it is to be noted that the regiment was fixed as the unit of organization, and made the connecting link between the soldier and his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>Above that, all was subject to the discretion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, save the pregnant intimation in relation to the distribution of generals among the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>It was generous and <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> confiding to surrender entirely to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> the appointment of generals, and it is the more incumbent on me to carry out as well as may be the spirit of the volunteer system.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>Recently reports have been asked for from the commanders of separate armies as to the composition of their respective brigades and divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>I have been much harassed, and the public interest has certainly suffered, by the delay to place the regiments of some of the <name>States</name> in brigades together, it being deemed that unjust discrimination was made against them, and also by the popular error which has existed as to the number of brigadiers to which appointments could be specially urged on the grounds of residence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>When at that time and place I met <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00386.01631" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> for conference, he called in the <num value="2">two</num> generals next in rank to himself, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0125.0048.00386.01632" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,,G.,W.,," id="n0125.0048.00386.01633" reg="default:Smith,G.,W.,,"><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>The question for consideration was, What course should be adopted for the future action of the army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>and the preliminary <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> inquiry by me was as to the number of the troops there assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>To my surprise and disappointment, the effective strength was stated to be but little greater than when it fought the battle of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> of the preceding <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>The frequent reenforcements which had been sent to that army in no wise prepared me for such an announcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>To my inquiry as to what force would be required for the contemplated advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, the lowest estimate made by any of them was about twice the number there present for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>How little I was prepared for such a condition of things will be realized from the fact that previous suggestions by the generals in regard to a purpose to advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had induced me, when I went to that conference, to take with me some drawings made by the veteran soldier and engineer, <persName n="Crozet,Colonel,,,," id="n0125.0048.00387.01634" reg="mostcommon:Crozet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Crozet</surname></persName>, of the falls of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, to show the feasibility of crossing the river at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4660"/>Very little knowledge of the condition and military resources of the country must have sufficed to show that I had no power to make such an addition to that army without a total disregard of the safety of other threatened positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4661"/>It only remained for me to answer that I had not power to furnish such a number of troops; and, unless the militia bearing their private arms should be relied on, we could not possibly fulfill such a requisition until after the receipt of the small arms which we had early and constantly striven to procure from abroad, and had for some time expected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/>After I had written the foregoing, and all the succeeding chapters on kindred subjects, a friend, in <dateStruct value="1880-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, furnished me with a copy of a paper relating to the conference at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court House">Fairfax Court House</placeName>, which seems to require notice at my hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>Therefore I break the chain of events to insert here some remarks in regard to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>The paper appears to have been written by <persName n="Smith,General,G.,W.,," id="n0125.0048.00387.01635" reg="default:Smith,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and to have received the approval of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00387.01636" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,P.,G.,T.,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,General,J.,E.,," id="n0125.0048.00387.01637" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, and to bear the date of <dateStruct value="1862-01-31"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="31">31</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>It does not agree in some respects with my memory of what occurred, and is not consistent with itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>It was not necessary that I should learn in that interview the evil of inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>My correspondence of anterior date might have shown that I was fully aware of it, and my suggestions in the interview certainly did not look as if it was necessary to impress me with the advantage of action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>In <num value="1">one</num> part of the paper it is stated that the reenforcements asked for were to be <quote>seasoned soldiers,</quote> such as were there present, and who were said to be in the <quote>finest fighting condition.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/>This, if such a proposition <pb id="p.388" n="388"/> had been made, would have exposed its absurdity, as well as the loophole it offered for escape, by subsequently asserting that the troops furnished were not up to the proposed standard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>In another part of the paper it is stated that there were hope and expectation that, before the end of the winter, arms would be introduced into the country, and that then we could successfully invade that of the enemy; but this supply of arms, however abundant, could not furnish <quote>seasoned soldiers,</quote> and the <num value="2">two</num> propositions are therefore inconsistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>In <num value="1">one</num> place it is written that <quote>it was felt it might be better to run the risk of almost certain destruction fighting upon the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, rather than see the gradual dying out and deterioration of this army during a winter,</quote> etc.; but, when it was proposed to cross into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516"><rs type="direction">eastern</rs> Maryland</placeName> on a steamer in our possession for a partial campaign, difficulties arose like the lion in the path of the sluggard, so that the proposition was postponed and never executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>In like manner the other expedition in the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs> was achieved by an officer not of this council, <persName n="Jackson,General,T.,J.,," id="n0125.0048.00388.01638" reg="default:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>In <num value="1">one</num> place it is written that the <rs>President</rs> stated, <quote>At that time no reenforcements could be furnished to the army of the character asked for.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>In another place he is made to say he could not take any troops from the points named, and, <quote>without arms from abroad, could not reenforce that army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>Here, again, it is clear from the answer that the proposition had been for such reenforcements as additional arms would enable him to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>Those arms he expected to receive, barring the dangers of the sea, and of the enemy, which obstacles alone prevented the <quote>positive assurance that they would be received at all.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/></p> 
<p>It was, as stated, with deep regret and bitter disappointment that I found, notwithstanding our diligent efforts to reenforce this army before and after the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, that its strength had but little increased, and that the arms of absentees and discharged men were represented by only <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>I cannot suppose that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00388.01639" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> could have noticed the statement that his request for conference had set forth the object of it to be to discuss the question of reenforcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>He would have known that in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, where all the returns were to be found, any consideration of reenforcement, by the withdrawal of troops from existing garrisons, could best be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>Very little experience or a fair amount of modesty without any experience would serve to prevent <num value="1">one</num> from announcing his conclusion that troops could be withdrawn from a place or places without knowing how many were there, and what was the necessity for their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/><pb id="p.389" n="389"/></p> 
<p>I was at the conference by request; the confidence felt in those officers is shown by the fact that I met them alone, and did not require any minutes to be made of the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>About <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> afterward a paper was prepared to make a record of the conversation; the fact was concealed from me, whereas, both for accuracy and frankness, it should have been submitted to me, even if there had been nothing due to our official relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/><measure n="20years" type="date">Twenty years</measure> after the event, I learned of this secret report, by <num value="1">one</num> party, without notice having been given to the other, of a conversation said to have lasted <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>I have noticed the improbabilities and inconsistencies of the paper, and without remark I submit to honorable men the concealment from me in which it was prepared, whereby they may judge of the chances for such co-intelligence as needs must exist between the executive and the commanders of armies to insure attainable success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>The position at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court House">Fairfax Court House</placeName>, though it would answer very well as a point from which to advance, was quite unfavorable for defense; when I so remarked, the opinion seemed to be that to which the generals had previously arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>It therefore only remained to consider what change of position should be made in the event of the enemy threatening soon to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>But in the meantime I hoped that something could be done by detachments from the army to effect objects less difficult than an advance against his main force, and particularly indicated the lower part of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, where a small force was said to be ravaging the country and oppressing our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>This, I thought, might be feasible by the establishment of a battery near to <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,1132269">Aquia Creek</placeName>, where the channel of the <rs>Potomac</rs> was said to be so narrow that our guns could prevent the use of the river by the enemy's boats, and, by employing a steamboat lying there, troops enough could be sent over some night to defeat that force, and return before any large body could be concentrated against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>The effect of the battery and of the expedition, it was hoped, would be important in relieving our friends and securing recruits from those who wished to join us. Previously, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00389.01640" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s attention had been called to possibilities in the <rs type="place">valley of the Shenandoah</rs>, and that these and other like things were not done, was surely due to other causes than <quote>the policy of the <name>Administration</name>,</quote> as will appear by the letters hereto annexed: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>Nothing is more common than that a general, realizing the wants of the army with which he is serving, and the ends that might be achieved if those wants were supplied, should overlook the necessities of others, and accept rumors of large forces which do not exist, and assume the absence of danger elsewhere than in his own front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>The attack on <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> would probably induce <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0125.0048.00391.01660" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to believe that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> had been so weakened as to justify him in making an advance on <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>; but, should this not induce him to advance, I do not believe anything will during the present winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/>You suggest that such force should be drawn from the army at the <rs>Greenbrier</rs>; this was originally considered, and abandoned, because they could not reach him in time to anticipate the enemy's concentration, and also because <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00393.01678" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was a stranger to them, and time was wanting for the growth of that confidence between the commander and his troops, the value of which need not be urged upon you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>To further inquiry from <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00399.01702" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> as to where he should take position, I replied that I would go to his headquarters in the field, and found him on the south bank of the river, to which he had retired, in a position possessing great natural advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>An elevated bank commanded the north side of the river, overlooking the bridge, and an open field beyond it, across which the enemy must pass to reach the bridge, which, if left standing, was an invitation to seek that crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>Upon inquiring whether the south bank of the river continued to command the other side down to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00399.01703" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> answered that he did not know; that he had not been at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> since he passed there in a stage on his way to <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, when he was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appointed a cadet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>I then proposed that we should go to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, to inform ourselves upon that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/>On arriving at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, a reconnaissance soon manifested that the hills on the opposite side commanded the town and adjacent river bank, and therefore <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> could only be defended by an army occupying the opposite hills, for which our force was inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>In returning to the house of <persName n="Barton,,,,," id="n0125.0048.00399.01704" reg="mostcommon:Barton,nomatch:0"><surname>Barton</surname></persName>, where I was a guest, I found a number of ladies had assembled there to welcome me, and who, with anxiety, inquired as to the result of our reconnaissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>Upon learning that the town was not considered defensible against an enemy occupying the heights on the other side, and that our force was not sufficient to hold those heights against such an attack as might be anticipated, the general answer was, with a self-sacrificing patriotism too much admired to be forgotten, <quote>If the good of our cause requires the defense of the town to be abandoned, let it be done.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>The purposes of the enemy were then unknown to us. If <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00399.01705" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s expectation of a hostile advance in great force should be realized, our <pb id="p.400" n="400"/> course must depend partly upon receiving the reenforcement we had reason to expect from promises previously given and renewed, as was announced to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00400.01706" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> in my telegram of <dateStruct value="1862-03-10"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, in these words: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>Further assurance given to me this day that you shall be promptly and adequately reenforced, so as to enable you to maintain your position, and resume <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> policy when the roads will permit.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>No immediate decision could therefore be made, and I returned to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to wait the further development of the enemy's plans, and to prepare as best we might to counteract them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>The feeling heretofore noticed as arousing in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> a determination to resist the abandonment of her northern frontier, and which caused the assurance of reenforcements, bore fruit in the addition of about <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men, by a draft made by the governor of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>These, it is true, were not the disciplined, seasoned troops which were asked for by the generals in the conference at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court House">Fairfax Court House</placeName>, but they were of such men as often during the war won battles for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>The development of the enemy's plans, for which we had to wait, proved that instead of advancing in force against our position at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, he had, before the retreat of our army commenced, decided to move down the <rs>Potomac</rs> for a campaign against <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> as a base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>The conflagration at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> gave notice of its evacuation, and an advance was made as far as <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 9" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, but, as appears by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00400.01707" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s report, with no more important design than to attack our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, if it should be encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>In the report on the conduct of the war by a committee of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>Whatever doubt or apprehension continued to exist about uncovering the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> by removing their main army from before it, was of course dispelled by the retreat of our army, and the burning of bridges behind it. In this last-mentioned fact, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0125.0048.00400.01708" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> says he found the strongest reason to believe that there was no immediate danger of our army returning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>There was an apparent advantage to the enemy in the new base for his operations which was sufficiently illustrated by the events of the last year of the war. Had we possessed an army as large as the enemy supposed, it would have been possible for us at the same time to check his advance from the <rs>East</rs> and to march against his capital, with fair prospect <pb id="p.401" n="401"/> of capturing it, before the army he had sent against <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> could have been brought back for the defense of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>On this as on other occasions he greatly magnified the force we possessed, and on this as on other occasions it required the concentration of our troops successfully to resist a detachment of his. Accepting as a necessity the withdrawal of the main portion of our army from <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Virginia</placeName> to meet the invasion from the seaboard, it was regretted that earlier and more effective means were not employed for the mobilization of the army, a desirable measure in either contingency of advance or retreat, or at the least that the withdrawal was not so deliberate as to secure the removal of our ordnance, subsistence, and quartermasters' stores, which had been collected on the line occupied in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and the early part of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>The enemy's plans, the development of which, as has been already stated, was necessary for the determination of our own movements, were soon thereafter found to be the invasion of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from the seaboard, and the principal portion of our army was consequently ordered to the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, between the <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName> and the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>To provide the iron needed for cannon and projectiles, it had been necessary to stimulate by contracts the mining and smelting of its ores.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>A large, difficult, and most important field of operations was thus assigned to him, and well did he fulfill its requirements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>To his recent experience was added scientific knowledge, and to both, untiring, systematic industry, and his heart's thorough devotion to the cause he served.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>The tree is known by its fruit, and he may confidently point to results as the evidence on which he is willing to stand for judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>Briefly, they will be noticed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>Niter was to be obtained from caves and other like sources, and by the formation of niter beds, some of which had previously been begun at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 23" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>These beds were located at <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia (South Carolina)</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, <placeName reg="Selma, Dallas, Alabama" key="tgn,2005248">Selma</placeName>, and various other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>At the close of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> there were <num value="2000000">two million</num> <measure n="800000feet" type="distance">eight hundred thousand feet</measure> of earth collected, and in various stages of nitrification, of which a large proportion was presumed to yield <measure n="1.5l." type="pounds"><num value="1.5">one and a half</num> pound</measure> of niter per foot of earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>The whole country was laid off into districts, each of which was under the charge of an officer, who obtained details of workmen from the army, and made his monthly reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>Thus the niter production, in the course of a year, was brought up to something like half of the total consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>The district from which the most constant yield could be relied on had its chief office at <placeName reg="Greensboro, Guilford, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014135">Greensboro, North Carolina</placeName>, a region which had no niter caves in it. The niter was obtained from lixiviation of <pb id="p.410" n="410"/> nitrous earth found under old houses, barns, etc. The supervision of the production of iron, lead, copper, and all the minerals which needed development, as well as the manufacture of sulphuric and nitric acids (the latter required for the supply of the fulminate of mercury for <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs>), without which the firearms of our day would have been useless, was added to the niter bureau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>Such was the progress that in a short time the bureau was aiding or managing some <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> furnaces with an annual yield of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> tons or more of <rs n="pig iron" type="product">pig iron</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>The lead-and copper-smelting works erected were sufficient for all wants, and the smelting of zinc of good quality had been achieved.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>In equipping the armies <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sent into the field, the supply of accessories was embarrassingly scant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>There were arms, such as they were, for over <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men, but no accoutrements nor equipments, and a meager supply of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>In time the knapsacks were sup-planted by haversacks, which the women could make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>But soldiers' shoes and cartridge boxes must be had; leather was also needed for artillery harness and for cavalry saddles; as the amount of leather which the country could furnish was quite insufficient for all these purposes, it was perforce apportioned among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>Soldiers' shoes were the prime necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>Therefore, a scale was established, by which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shoes and then cartridge boxes had the preference; after these, artillery harness, and then saddles and bridles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>To economize leather, the waist and cartridge-box belts were made of prepared cotton cloth stitched in <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> thicknesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>Bridle reins were likewise so made, and then cartridge boxes were thus covered, except the flap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>Saddle skirts, too, were made of heavy cotton cloth strongly stitched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>To get leather, each department procured its quota of hides, made contracts with the tanners, obtained hands for them by exemptions from the army, got transportation over the railroads for the hides and for supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>To the varied functions of this bureau was finally added that of assisting the tanners to procure the necessary supplies for the tanneries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>A fishery, even, was established on <placeName reg="Cape Fear, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1122498">Cape Fear River</placeName> to get oil for mechanical purposes, and at the same time food for the workmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>In cavalry equipments the main thing was to get a good saddle which would not hurt the back of the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>For this purpose various patterns were tried, and reasonable success was obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most difficult wants to supply in this branch of the service was the horseshoe for cavalry and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>The want of iron and of skilled labor was strongly felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>Every wayside blacksmith shop accessible, especially <pb id="p.411" n="411"/> those in and near the theatre of operations, was employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>These, again, had to be supplied with material, and the employees exempted from service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>It early became manifest that great reliance must be placed on the introduction of articles of prime necessity through the blockaded ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>A vessel capable of stowing <measure n="650barrels" type="mass">six hundred fifty bales</measure> of cotton was purchased by the agent in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and kept running between <placeName key="tgn,7005064" n="1.000 3" reg="bermuda">Bermuda</placeName> and <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>Some <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num> successive trips were made before she was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>Another was added, which was equally successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>These vessels were long, low, rather narrow, and built for speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/>They were mostly of pale sky color, and, with their lights out and with fuel that made little smoke, they ran to and from <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> with considerable regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>Several others were added, and devoted to bringing in ordnance, and finally general supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5124"/>At the same time the tariff was revised, and preparatory measures taken for the levy of internal taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5126"/>The plan then adopted was founded on the theory of issuing treasury notes, convertible at the pleasure of the holder into <num value="0.08">eight per cent</num> bonds, with the interest payable in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5127"/>It was assumed that any tendency to depreciation, which might arise from the overissue of the currency, would be checked by the constant exercise of the holder's right to fund the notes at a liberal interest, payable in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5128"/>The success of this system depended on the ability of the government constantly to pay the interest in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5129"/>The measures, therefore, adopted to secure that payment consisted in the levy of an internal tax, termed a war tax, and the appropriation of the revenue from imports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5130"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> operation of this plan was quite successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5131"/>The interest was paid from the reserve of coin existing in the country, and experience sustained the expectations of those who devised the system.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5133"/>The other agricultural products of the country were at similarly moderate rates, thus indicating that there was no excess of circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5134"/>At the same time the premium on coin had reached about <num value="0.2">twenty per cent.</num> But it had become apparent that the commerce of our country was threatened with permanent suspension by reason of the conduct of neutral nations, who virtually gave aid to the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5135"/>Those neutral nations treated our invasion by our former limited and special agent as though it were the attempt of a sovereign to suppress a rebellion against lawful authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5136"/>This exceptional cause heightened the premium on specie, because it indicated the exhaustion of our reserve, without the possibility of renewing the supply.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5138"/>This will be further explained presently in our statement of the system of taxation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5139"/>Under all these circumstances the effort was made to avoid the increase in the volume of notes in circulation, by offering inducements to voluntary funding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5140"/>The measures adopted for that purpose were but partially successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5141"/>Meanwhile the intervening exigencies from the fortunes of war permitted no delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5142"/>The issues of treasury notes were increased until, in <dateStruct value="1863-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, the currency in circulation amounted to more than <measure n="600000000dollars" type="currency">six hundred million dollars</measure>, or more than threefold the amount required <pb id="p.421" n="421"/> by the business of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>The evil effects of this financial condition were but too apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>In addition to the difficulty presented to the necessary operations of the government, and the efficient conduct of the war, the most deplorable of all its results was, undoubtedly, its corrupting influence on the morals of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>The possession of large amounts of treasury notes led to a desire for investment; with a constantly increasing volume of currency, there was an equally constant increase of price in all objects of investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5146"/>This effect stimulated purchase by the apparent certainty of profit, and a spirit of speculation was thus fostered, which had so debasing an influence and such ruinous consequences that it became our highest duty to remove the cause by prompt and stringent measures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>I therefore recommended to Congress in <dateStruct value="1863-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, the compulsory reduction of the currency to the amount required by the business of the country, accompanied by a pledge that, under no stress of circumstances, would the amount be increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>I stated that, if the currency was not greatly and promptly reduced, the existing scale of inflated prices would not only continue, but by the very fact of the large amounts thus made requisite in the conduct of the war, these prices would reach rates still more extravagant, and the whole system would fall under its own weight, rendering the redemption of the debt impossible, and destroying its value in the hands of the holder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>If, on the contrary, a funded debt, with interest secured by adequate taxation, could be substituted for the outstanding currency, its entire amount would be made available to the holder, and the government would be in a condition, beyond the reach of any probable contingency, to prosecute the war to a successful issue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>This recommendation was followed by the passage of the act of <dateStruct value="1864-02-17"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="17">17</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, above mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/><num value="1">One</num> of its features is the tax levied on the circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>Regarding the government when contracting a debt as the agent of the people, its debt is their debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>As the currency was held exclusively by ourselves, it was obvious that, if each person held treasury notes in exact proportion to the valuation of his whole estate, each would in fact owe himself the amount of the notes held by him; were it possible to distribute the currency among the people in this exact proportion, a tax levied on the currency alone, to an amount sufficient to reduce it to its proper limits, would afford the best of all remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>Under such circumstances, the notes remaining in the hands of each holder after the payment of his tax would be worth quite as <pb id="p.422" n="422"/> much as the whole sum previously held, for it would have an equal purchasing capacity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>After this law had been in operation for <num value="1">one</num> year, it was manifest that it had the desired effect of withdrawing from circulation the large excess of treasury notes which had been issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>The constitution of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> required that no law should ever be passed <quote>to raise a loan of money on the credit of the <rs>State</rs>, or to pledge the faith of the <rs>State</rs> for the payment or redemption of any loan or debt,</quote> unless such law should be proposed and adopted by the legislature, then published for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> previous to the next regular election, and finally reenacted by the succeeding legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5214"/>The object was to enable the people of the state to consider the question intelligently, and to indicate and exercise their will upon it by the election of representatives to the ensuing legislature, whose views upon the subject would be known, and with such instructions, express or implied, as they might think proper to give.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>In <dateStruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct> a law was passed by the legislature for incorporating the <quote><orgName n="Union Bank" type="bank">Union bank of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName></orgName>,</quote> with a capital of <num value="15000000">fifteen million</num> <measure n="500000dollars" type="currency">five hundred thousand dollars</measure>, <quote>to be raised by means of a loan to be obtained by the directors of the institution.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5216"/>In order to secure this loan, the stockholders were required to give mortgages on productive and unencumbered property, to be in all cases of value greater, by a fixed ratio, than the amount of their stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5217"/>When the stock had been thus secured, as a further guarantee for the redemption of the loan, the governor was directed to issue bonds, in the name and behalf of the state, equal in amount to the stock secured by mortgage on private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>No bonds as thus directed were ever issued.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>While these events were occurring, and until a period several years subsequent to their consummation, I, who had just resigned my commission in the army, was a private citizen, had never held any civil office, and took no part in political affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>Indeed, I have never at any time before, during, or since those events held any civil office under the state government, and neither had nor could have had any part in shaping the policy of the state.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>As a private citizen, it may be stated that I held that the question of the validity of the bonds should be decided by the courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>The constitution of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> authorized suit to be brought against the state in such cases in her own courts, and this I regarded as the proper course to be pursued by the bondholders, holding that the state would be bound by the judicial decision, if it should sustain the validity of the claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>This course, however, was not adopted until long afterward, when the question had become complicated with political issues, which rendered the effort to obtain a settlement entirely nugatory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>When I was a member of the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, my official influence was exerted to promote the objects of a citizen of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, who, with quasi-credentials from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0125.0050.00426.01741" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, went to <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName> to propose to the bondholders an arrangement by which the claim, or the greater portion of it, might be paid by private subscription, on consideration of the cancellation of the bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>This effort failed, from a mistaken estimate on the part of some of the principal bondholders, to whom the proposition was made, of the extent to which state pride would induce our citizens to contribute, and to the belief in a power to coerce payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>For a long time after the formation of the <quote>more perfect Union,</quote> but little capital was invested in manufacturing establishments; though in the early part of the present century the amount had considerably increased, the products were yet quite insufficient for the necessary supplies of our armies in the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>Government contracts, high prices, and to some extent, no doubt, patriotic impulses, led to the investment of capital in the articles required for the prosecution of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>These good intentions, if it be conceded that the danger was real which it was designed to avert, were most unfortunate as the beginning of a policy the end of which was fraught with the greatest evils that have ever befallen the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>It was true, and of course it was known, that such duties would <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> give incidental protection to any industry producing an article on which the duty was levied; while the money was collected for the purposes enumerated, and the rate kept down to the lowest revenue standard, the consumer had no cause to complain of the indirect benefit received by the manufacturer, and the history of the time shows that it produced no discontent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time a tariff law had protection for its object, and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time it produced discontent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>In the law there was nothing which necessarily gave to it or in its terms violated the obligation that duties should be uniform throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>The fact that it affected the sections differently was due to physical causes&mdash;that is, geographical differences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>The streams of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Atlantic</placeName> states ran over wide plains into the sea; their last falls were remote from ocean navigation; their people, almost exclusively agricultural, resided principally on this plain, and as near to the seaboard as circumstances would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5261"/>In the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Atlantic</placeName> states the highlands approached more nearly to the sea, and the rivers made their last leap near to harbors of commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5262"/>Water power being relied on before the steam engine had been made, and ships the medium of commerce before railroads and locomotives were introduced, it followed that the staples of the <rs>Southern</rs> plains were economically sent to the water power of the <rs>North</rs> to be manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5263"/>This remark, of course, applies to such articles as were not exported to foreign countries, and is intended to explain how the <rs>North</rs> became the seat of manufactures, and the <rs>South</rs> remained agricultural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5264"/>From this it followed that legislation for the benefit of manufacturers became a Northern policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5265"/>It was not, as has been erroneously stated, because of the agricultural character of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, that they were opposed to the policy inaugurated by the tariff act of <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5266"/>This is shown by the fact that anterior to that time they had been the friends of manufacturing industry, without reference to its location.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>As long as duties were imposed for revenue, so that the object was to supply the common treasury, it had been cheerfully borne, and the agriculture of <num value="1">one</num> section and the manufacturing of <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> another were properly regarded as handmaids, and not infrequently referred to as the means of strengthening and perpetuating the bonds by which the states were united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5268"/>When duties were imposed, not for revenue, but as a bounty to a particular industry, it was regarded both as unjust and without warrant, expressed or implied, in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5269"/>Then arose the controversy, quadrennially renewed and with increasing provocation, in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct>, in <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>, and in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>&mdash;each stage intensifying the discontent, arising more from the injustice than the weight of the burden borne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5270"/>It was not the <measure n="20s." type="currency"><num value="20">twenty</num>-shilling</measure> ship-money tax, but the violation of <rs n="Magna Charta" type="document">Magna Charta</rs>, which <persName n="Hampden,,,,," id="n0125.0050.00430.01744" reg="mostcommon:Hampden,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampden</surname></persName> and his associates resisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5271"/>It was not the stamp duty nor the tea tax, but the principle involved in taxation without representation, against which our colonial fathers took up arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5272"/>So the tariff act in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>, known at the time as <quote>the bill of abominations,</quote> was resisted by Southern representatives because it was the invasion of private rights in violation of the compact by which the states were united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5273"/>In the last stage of the proceeding, after the friends of the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5274"/>had advocated it as a measure for protecting capital invested in manufactures, <persName n="Drayton,,,,," id="n0125.0050.00430.01745" reg="mostcommon:Drayton,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>Drayton</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> moved to amend the title so that it should read, <quote>An act to increase the duties upon certain imports, for the purpose of increasing the profits of certain manufacturers,</quote> and stated his purpose for desiring to amend the title to be that, upon some case which would arise under the execution of the law, an appeal might be made to the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> to test its constitutionality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>Those who had passed the bill refused to allow the opportunity to test the validity of a tax imposed for the protection of a particular industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>Though the debates showed clearly enough the purpose to be to impose duties for protection, the phraseology of the law presented it as enacted to raise revenue, and therefore the victims of the discrimination were deprived of an appeal to the tribunal instituted to hear and decide on the constitutionality of a law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, oppressed by onerous duties and stung by the injustice of a refusal to allow her the ordinary remedy against unconstitutional legislation, asserted the right, as a sovereign state, to nullify the law. This conflict between the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <num value="1">one</num> of the states threatened for a time such disastrous consequences as to excite intense feeling in all who loved the <rs>Union</rs> as the fraternal federation of equal states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>Before an actual collision of arms occurred, Congress wisely adopted the compromise act of <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/>By that the fact of protection remained, but the principle of duties for revenue was recognized by a sliding scale of reduction, and it was hoped the question had been <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> placed upon a basis that promised a permanent peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5280"/>The party of protective duties, however, came into power about the close of the period when the compromise measure had reached the result it proposed, and the contest was renewed with little faith on the part of the then dominant party and with more than all of its former bitterness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>The cause of the departure from a sound principle of a tariff for revenue, which had prevailed during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quarter of a century, and the adoption in <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> of the rule imposing duties for protection, was stated by <persName n="McDuffie,,,,," id="n0125.0050.00431.01746" reg="mostcommon:McDuffie,&mdash;,,,:1"><surname>McDuffie</surname></persName> to be that politicians and capitalists had seized upon the subject and used it for their own purposes&mdash;the former for political advancement, the latter for their own pecuniary profit&mdash;and that the question had become <num value="1">one</num> of partisan politics and sectional enrichment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5282"/>Contemporaneously with this theory of protective duties arose the policy of making appropriations from the common treasury for local improvements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5283"/>As the <rs>Southern</rs> representatives were mainly those who denied the constitutional power to make such expenditures, it naturally resulted that the mass of those appropriations were made for Northern works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5284"/>Now that direct taxes had in practice been so wholly abandoned as to be almost an obsolete idea, and now that the treasury was supplied by the collection of duties upon imports, <num value="2">two</num> golden streams flowed steadily to enrich the <rs>Northern</rs> and manufacturing region by the impoverishment of the <rs>Southern</rs> and agricultural section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5285"/>In the train of wealth and demand for labor followed immigration and the more rapid increase of population in the <rs>Northern</rs> than in the <rs>Southern</rs> states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5286"/>I do not deny the existence of other causes, such as the fertile region of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, the better harbors, the greater amount of shipping of the <rs>Northeastern</rs> states, and the prejudice of Europeans against contact with the negro race; the causes I have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stated were, I think, the chief, and those only which are referable to the action of the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>It was not found that the possession of power mitigated the injustice of its use by the <rs>North</rs>, and discontent therefore was steadily accumulating, and, as stated in the beginning of this chapter, I think was due to class legislation in the form of protective duties and its consequences more than to any or all other causes combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>Turning from the consideration of this question in its sectional aspect, I now invite attention to its general effect upon the character of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/>If the common treasury of the states had, as under the <name>Confederation</name>, been supplied by direct taxation, who can doubt that a rigid economy would have been the rule of the government; that representatives would have returned to their tax-paying constituents to justify appropriations for which they had voted by <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> showing that they were required for the general welfare, and were authorized by the <rs>Constitution</rs> under which they were acting?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>When the money was obtained by indirect taxation, so that but few could see the source from which it was derived, it readily followed that a constituency would ask, not why the representative had voted for the expenditure of money, but how much he had got for his own district, and perhaps he might have to explain why he did not get more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>Is it doubtful that this would lead to extravagance, if not to corruption?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5292"/>Nothing could be more fatal to the independence of the people and the liberties of the states than dependence for support upon the public treasury, whether it be in the form of subsidies, of bounties, or restrictions on trade for the benefit of special interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>In the decline of the <rs>Roman Empire</rs>, the epoch in which the hopelessness of renovation was made manifest was that in which the people accepted corn from the public granaries: it preceded but a little the time when the post of emperor became a matter of purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/>How far would it differ from this if constituencies should choose their representatives, not for their integrity, not for their capacity, not for their past services, but because of their ability to get money from the public treasury for the benefit of their local interests; how far would it differ from a purchase of the office if a President were chosen because of the favor he would show to certain moneyed interests?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>Now that fanaticism can no longer inflame the prejudices of the uninformed, it may be hoped that our statesmen will review the past, and give to our country a future in accordance with its early history, and promotive of true liberty. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5297"/>The agricultural products were diminished every year during the war. Its demands diminished the number of cultivators, and their labors were more extensively devoted to grain crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5298"/>The amount of the cotton crop was greatly reduced, and numbers of bales were destroyed when in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5299"/>The manufacturing industry became more extensive than ever before, and in many branches more highly developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5300"/>The results in the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">ordnance department</orgName> of the government, stated elsewhere in these pages, serve as an illustration of the achievements in many branches of industry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5301"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war the authority granted to the <rs>President</rs> to call for volunteers in the army for a short period was sufficient to secure all the military force which we could fit out and use advantageously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5302"/>As it became evident that the contest would be long and severe, better measures of preparation were enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>I was authorized to call out and place in the military service for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, unless the war should sooner end, all white men residents of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure>, and to continue those already in the field until <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> from the date of their enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/>But those under <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> and over <num value="35">thirty-five</num> were required to remain <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>. The existing organization of companies, regiments, <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> etc. was preserved, but the former were filled up to the number of <num value="125">one hundred twenty-five</num> men. This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step toward placing the army in a permanent and efficient condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5305"/>The term of service being lengthened, the changes by discharges and by receiving recruits were diminished, so that, while additions were made to the forces already in the field, the discipline was greatly improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5306"/>At the same time, on <dateStruct value="1862-03-13"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="13">13</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lee,General,Robert,E.,," id="n0125.0051.00434.01747" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was <quote>charged with the conduct of the military operations of the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs></quote> under my direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5307"/>Nevertheless, the law upon which our success so greatly depended was assailed with unexpected criticism in various quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5308"/>A constitutional question of high importance was raised, which tended to involve the harmony of cooperation, so essential in this crisis, between the general and the state governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5309"/>It was advanced principally by the governor of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <persName n="Brown,the Honorable,Joseph,E.,," id="n0125.0051.00434.01748" reg="default:Brown,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, and the following extracts are taken from my reply to him, dated <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5311"/>I propose, from my high respect for yourself and for other eminent citizens who entertain opinions similar to yours, to set forth somewhat at length my own views on the power of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> over its own armies and the militia, and will endeavor not to leave without answer any of the positions maintained in your letters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5312"/>The main, if not the only, purpose for which independent states form unions, or confederations, is to combine the power of the several members in such manner as to form <num value="1">one</num> united force in all relations with foreign powers, whether in peace or in war. Each state, amply competent to administer and control its own domestic government, yet too feeble successfully to resist powerful nations, seeks safety by uniting with other states in like condition, and by delegating to some common agent the use of the combined strength of all, in order to secure advantageous commercial relations in peace, and to carry on hostilities with effect in war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5313"/>Now, the powers delegated by the several States to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, which is their common agent, are enumerated in the <orgName type="regiment" key="8Section">eighth section</orgName> of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; each power being distinct, specific, and enumerated in paragraphs separately numbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5314"/>The only exception is the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> paragraph, which by its own terms is made dependent on those previously enumerated, as follows: <quote><num value="18">18</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5315"/>To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers,</quote> etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5316"/>Now the <hi rend="italics">war-powers</hi> granted to the <rs>Congress</rs> are conferred in the following paragraphs: <num value="1">No. 1</num> <quote>gives authority to raise revenue necessary to pay the debts, provide for <hi rend="italics">the common defense</hi>, and carry on the <rs>Government</rs>,</quote> etc. <num value="11">No. 11</num>, <quote>To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5320"/></p> 
<p>It is impossible to imagine a more broad, ample, and unqualified delegation of the whole war power of each State than is here contained, with the solitary limitations of the appropriations to <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. The States not only gave power to raise money for the common defense, to declare war, to raise and support armies (in the plural), to provide and maintain a navy, to govern and regulate both land and naval forces, but they went further, and covenanted, by the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> paragraph of the <orgName type="regiment" key="10Section">tenth section</orgName>, not <quote>to engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5321"/></p> 
<p>I know of but <num value="2">two</num> modes of raising armies within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>., voluntary enlistment and draft, or conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5322"/>I perceive, in the delegation of power, to raise armies, no restriction as to the mode of procuring troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5323"/>I see nothing which confines Congress to <num value="1">one</num> class of men, nor any greater power to receive volunteers than conscripts into its service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5324"/>I see no limitation by which enlistments are to be received of individuals only, but not of companies, or battalions, or squadrons, or regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5325"/>I find no limitation of time or service, but only of duration of appropriation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5326"/>I discover nothing to confine Congress to waging war within the limits of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, nor to prohibit offensive war. In a word, when Congress desires to raise an army, and passes a law for that purpose, the solitary question is under the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> paragraph, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>., <quote>Is the law <num value="1">one</num> that is necessary and proper to execute the power to raise armies?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5327"/></p> 
<p>On this point you say: <quote>But did the necessity exist in this case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5328"/>The conscription act can not aid the <rs>Government</rs> in increasing its supply of <hi rend="italics">arms</hi> or <hi rend="italics">provisions</hi>, but can only enable it to call a larger number of men into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5329"/>The difficulty has never been to get <hi rend="italics">men</hi>. The States have already furnished the <rs>Government</rs> more than it can arm,</quote> etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5330"/>I would have very little difficulty in establishing to your entire satisfaction that the passage of the law was not only necessary, but that it was absolutely indispensable; that numerous regiments of <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> men were on the eve of being disbanded, whose places could not be supplied by raw levies in the face of superior numbers of the foe, without entailing the most disastrous results; that the position of our armies was so critical as to fill the bosom of every patriot with the liveliest apprehension; and that the provisions of this law were effective in warding off a pressing danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5331"/>But I prefer to answer your objection on other and broader grounds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5332"/>I hold that, when a specific power is granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, like that now in question, <quote>to raise armies,</quote> Congress is the judge whether the law passed for the purpose of executing that power is <quote>necessary and proper.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5333"/>It is not enough to say that armies might be raised in other ways, and that, therefore, this particular way is not <quote>necessary.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5334"/>The same argument might be used against <hi rend="italics">every</hi> mode of raising armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5335"/>To each successive mode suggested, the objection would be that other modes were practicable, and that, therefore, the particular mode used was not <quote>necessary.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5336"/>The true and only test is to inquire whether the law is intended and calculated to carry out the object; whether it devises and creates an instrumentality for executing the specific power granted; and, if the answer be in the affirmative, the law is constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5337"/>None can doubt that the <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> conscription law is calculated and intended to <quote>raise armies</quote>; it is, therefore, <quote>necessary and proper</quote> for the execution of that power, and is constitutional, unless it comes in conflict with some other provision of our Confederate compact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5338"/>You express the opinion that this conflict exists, and support your argument by the citation of those clauses which refer to the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5339"/>There are certain provisions not cited by you, which are not without influence on my judgment, and to which I call your attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5340"/>They will aid in defining what is meant by <quote>militia,</quote> and in determining the respective powers of the <name>States</name> and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> over them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5346"/>What, then, are militia?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5348"/>The Constitution also tells us that militia are not <hi rend="italics">troops</hi>, nor are they any part of the <hi rend="italics">land</hi> or <hi rend="italics">naval forces;</hi> for militia exist in time of peace, and the <rs>Constitution</rs> forbids the <name>States</name> to keep troops in time of peace, and they are expressly distinguished and placed in a separate category from land or naval forces in the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> paragraph above quoted; and the words <hi rend="italics">land</hi> and <hi rend="italics">naval forces</hi> are shown by paragraphs <num value="12">12</num>, <num value="13">13</num>, and <num value="14">14</num>, to mean the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5360"/>I confess myself at a loss to perceive in what manner these careful and well-defined provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, regulating the organization and government of the militia, can be understood as applying in the remotest degree to the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, nor can I conceive how the grant of <hi rend="italics">exclusive</hi> power to declare and carry on war by armies raised and supported by the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is to be restricted or diminished by the clauses which grant a <hi rend="italics">divided</hi> power over the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5361"/>On the contrary, the delegation of authority over the militia, so far as granted, appears to me to be plainly an <hi rend="italics">additional</hi> enumerated power intended to strengthen the hands of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> in the discharge of its paramount duty, the common defense of the <name>States</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5362"/>You state, after quoting the <num value="12" type="ordinal">twelfth</num>, <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num>, and <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> grants of power to Congress, that <quote>these grants of power all relate to the same subject-matter, and are all contained in the same section of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and, by a well-known rule of construction, must be taken as a whole and construed together.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5363"/></p> 
<p>This argument appears to me unsound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5364"/><hi rend="italics">All</hi> the powers of Congress are enumerated in <num value="1">one</num> section, and the <num value="3">three</num> paragraphs quoted can no more control each other by reason of their location in the same section than they can control any of the other paragraphs preceding, intervening, or succeeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5365"/>So far as the subject-matter is concerned, I have already endeavored to show that the armies mentioned in the <num value="12" type="ordinal">twelfth</num> paragraph are a subject-matter as distinct from the militia mentioned in the <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> and <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> as they are from the navy mentioned in the <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5366"/>Nothing can so mislead as to construe together, and as a whole, the carefully separated clauses which define the different powers .to be exercised over distinct subjects by the <rs>Congress</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5367"/>But you add that, <quote>by the grant of power to Congress to raise and support armies without qualification, the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> intended the regular armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and not armies composed of the whole militia of all the <name>States</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5368"/></p> 
<p>I must confess myself somewhat at a loss to understand this position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5369"/>If I am right that the militia is a body of enrolled State soldiers, it is not possible in <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> the nature of things that armies raised by the <rs>Confederacy</rs> can <quote>be composed of the whole militia of all the <name>States</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5370"/>The militia may be called forth in whole or in part into the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, but do not thereby become part of the <quote>armies raised</quote> by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5371"/>They remain militia, and go home when the emergency which provoked their call has ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5372"/>Armies raised by Congress are of course raised out of the <hi rend="italics">same population</hi> as the militia organized by the <name>States</name>, and to deny to Congress the power to draft a citizen into the army, or to receive his voluntary offer of services, because he is a member of the <rs>State</rs> militia, is to deny the power to raise an army at all; for, practically, all men fit for service in the army may be embraced in the militia organization of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5373"/>You seem, however, to suggest, rather than directly to assert, that the conscript law may be unconstitutional, because it comprehends all arms-bearing men between <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure>; at least, this is an inference which I draw from your expression, <quote>armies composed of the <hi rend="italics">whole</hi> militia of <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the <name>States</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5374"/>But it is obvious that, if Congress have power to draft into the armies raised by it any citizens at all (without regard to the fact whether they are, or not, members of militia organizations), the power must be coextensive with the exigencies of the occasion, or it becomes illusory; and the extent of the exigency must be determined by Congress; for the <rs>Constitution</rs> has left the power without any other check or restriction than the <rs>Executive</rs> veto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5375"/>Under ordinary circumstances, the power thus delegated to Congress is scarcely felt by the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5376"/>At the present moment, when our very existence is threatened by armies vastly superior in numbers to ours, the necessity for defense has induced a call, not for <quote>the whole militia of all the <name>States</name>,</quote> not for any militia, but for men to compose <hi rend="italics">armies</hi> for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5377"/>Surely there is no mystery in this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5378"/>During our whole past history, as well as during our recent <num value="1">one</num> year's experience as a new Confederacy, the militia <quote>have been called forth to repel invasion</quote> in numerous instances, and they never came otherwise than as bodies organized by the <name>States</name> with their company, field, and <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>;</hi> and, when the emergency had passed, they went home again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5379"/>I can not perceive how any <num value="1">one</num> can interpret the conscription law as taking away from the <name>States</name> the power to appoint officers to their militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5380"/>You observe on this point in your letter that, unless your construction is adopted, <quote>the very object of the <name>States</name> in reserving the power of appointing the officers is defeated, and that portion of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is not only a nullity, but the whole military power of the <name>States</name>, and the entire control of the militia, with the appointment of the officers, is vested in the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, whenever it chooses to call its own action <q direct="unspecified">raising an army,</q> and not <q direct="unspecified">calling forth the militia.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5381"/></quote> </p> 
<p>I can only say, in reply to this, that the power of Congress depends on the real nature of the act it proposes to perform, not on the name given to it; and I have endeavored to show that its action is really that of <quote>raising an army,</quote> and bears no semblance to <quote>calling forth the militia.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5382"/>I think I may safely venture the assertion that there is not <num value="1">one</num> man out of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> of those who will do service under the conscription act that will describe himself while in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service as being a militiaman; and, if I am right in this assumption, the popular understanding concurs entirely with my own deductions from the <rs>Constitution</rs> as to the meaning of the word <quote>militia.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5383"/><pb id="p.439" n="439"/></p> 
<p>My answer has grown to such a length, that I must confine myself to <num value="1">one</num> more quotation from your letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5384"/>You proceed: <quote>Congress shall have power to <hi rend="italics">raise armies</hi>. How shall it be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5385"/>The answer is clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5386"/>In conformity to the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which expressly provides that, when the militia of the <name>States</name> are called forth to <hi rend="italics">repel invasion</hi>, and employed in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which is now the case, the <rs>State</rs> shall appoint the officers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5387"/></p> 
<p>I beg you to observe that the answer which you say is clear is not an answer to the question put. The question is, How are armies to be raised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5388"/>The answer given is, that, when militia are called upon to repel invasion, the <rs>State</rs> shall appoint the officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5389"/>There seems to me to be a conclusive test on this whole subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5390"/>By our <orgName n="Constitution Congress" type="congress">Constitution, Congress</orgName> may declare war, <hi rend="italics">offensive</hi> as well as <hi rend="italics">defensive</hi>. It may acquire territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5392"/>The militia could not be called forth in such a case, the right to call it being limited <quote>to repel invasions.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5393"/>Is it not plain that the law now under discussion, if passed under such circumstances, could by no possibility be aught else than a law to <quote>raise an army</quote>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5395"/>At some future day, after our independence shall have been established, it is no improbable supposition that our present enemy may be tempted to abuse his naval power by depredations on our commerce, and that we may be compelled to assert our rights by offensive war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5396"/>Of what is the army to be composed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5409"/>In the operation of the military laws we found the exemption from military duty accorded by the law to all persons engaged in certain specified pursuits or professions to be unwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5410"/>Indeed, it seems to be indefensible in theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5411"/>The defense of home, family, and country is universally recognized as the paramount political duty of every member of society; in a form of government where each citizen enjoys an equality of rights and privileges, nothing can be more invidious than an unequal distribution of duties or obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5415"/>It brought forward, however, the question of the employment of the negroes as soldiers in the army, which was warmly advocated by some and as ardently opposed by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5416"/>My own views upon it were expressed freely and frequently in intercourse with members of Congress, and emphatically in my message of <dateStruct value="1864-11-07"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="7">7</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when, urging upon Congress the consideration of the propriety of a radical modification of the theory of the law, I said: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>Viewed merely as property, and therefore as the subject of impressment, the service or labor of the slave has been frequently claimed for short periods in the construction of defensive works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>The slave, however, bears another relation to the state&mdash;that of a person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>The law of last <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> contemplates only the <pb id="p.441" n="441"/> relation of the slave to the master, and limits the impressment to a certain term of service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5420"/>But, for the purposes enumerated in the act, instruction in the manner of camping, marching, and packing trains is needful, so that even in this limited employment length of service adds greatly to the value of the negro's labor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5422"/>In this aspect the relation of person predominates so far as to render it doubtful whether the private right of property can consistently and beneficially be continued, and it would seem proper to acquire for the public service the entire property in the labor of the slave, and to pay therefor due compensation, rather than to impress his labor for short terms; and this the more especially as the effect of the present law would vest this entire property in all cases where the slave might be recaptured after compensation for his loss had been paid to the private owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5423"/>Whenever the entire property in the service of a slave is thus acquired by the <rs>Government</rs>, the question is presented by what tenure he should be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5424"/>Should he be retained in servitude, or should his emancipation be held out to him as a reward for faithful service, or should it be granted at once on the promise of such service; and if emancipated what action should be taken to secure for the freed man the permission of the <rs>State</rs> from which he was drawn to reside within its limits after the close of his public service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/>The permission would doubtless be more readily accorded as a reward for past faithful service, and a double motive for zealous discharge of duty would thus be offered to those employed by the <rs>Government</rs>&mdash;their freedom and the gratification of the local attachment which is so marked a characteristic of the negro and forms so powerful an incentive to his action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5426"/>The policy of engaging to liberate the negro on his discharge after service faithfully rendered seems to me preferable to that of granting immediate manumission, or that of retaining him in servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5427"/>If this policy should commend itself to the judgment of Congress, it is suggested that, in addition to the duties heretofore performed by the slave, he might be advantageously employed as a pioneer and engineer laborer, and, in that event, that the number should be augmented to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5428"/>Beyond this limit and these employments it does not seem to me desirable under existing circumstances to go.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/>A broad, moral distinction exists between the use of slaves as soldiers in defense of their homes and the incitement of the same persons to insurrection against their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>The <num value="1">one</num> is justifiable, if necessary, the other is iniquitous and unworthy of civilized people; and such is the judgment of all writers on public law, as well as that expressed and insisted on by our enemies in all wars prior to that now waged against us. By none have the practices of which they are now guilty been denounced with greater severity than by themselves in the <num value="2">two</num> wars with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in the last and in the present century, and in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, when an enumeration was made of the wrongs which justified the revolt from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<p>The subject is to be viewed by us, therefore, solely in the light of policy and our social economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5433"/>When so regarded, I must dissent from those who advise a general levy and arming of the slaves for the duty of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5434"/>Until our white population shall prove insufficient for the armies we require and can afford to keep in the field, to employ as a soldier the negro, who has merely been trained to labor, and, as a laborer, the white man accustomed from his youth to the use of arms, would scarcely be deemed wise or advantageous by any; and this is the question now before us. But should the alternative ever be presented of subjugation, or of the employment of the slave as a soldier, there seems no reason to doubt what should then be our decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5435"/>Whether our view embraces what would, in so extreme a case, be the sum of misery entailed by the dominion of the enemy, or be restricted solely to the effect upon the welfare and happiness of the negro population themselves, the result would be the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>The appalling demoralization, suffering, disease, and death, which have been caused by partially substituting the invaders' system of police for the kind relation previously subsisting between the master and slave, have been a sufficient demonstration that external interference with our institution of domestic slavery is productive of evil only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>If the subject involved no other consideration than the mere right of property, the sacrifices heretofore made by our people have been such as to permit no doubt of their readiness to surrender every possession in order to secure independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>But the social and political question which is exclusively under the control of the several States has a far wider and more enduring importance than that of pecuniary interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5439"/>In its manifold phases it embraces the stability of our republican institutions, resting on the actual political equality of all its citizens, and includes the fulfillment of the task which has been so happily begun&mdash;that of Christianizing and improving the condition of the <name>Africans</name> who have by the will of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> been placed in our charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5440"/>Comparing the results of our own experience with those of the experiments of others who have borne similar relations to the <name>African</name> race, the people of the several States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have abundant reason to be satisfied with the past, and to use the greatest circumspection in determining their course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>These considerations, however, are rather applicable to the improbable contingency of our need of resorting to this element of assistance than to our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>If the recommendation above, made for the training of <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> negroes for the service indicated, shall meet your approval, it is certain that even this limited number, by their preparatory training in intermediate duties, would form a more valuable reserve force in case of urgency than threefold their number suddenly called from field-labor, while a fresh levy could to a certain extent supply their places in the special service for which they are now employed.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5457"/>Sir, I have another hope, for the fulfillment of which the signs of the times seem most propitious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>An unusually long exemption from a general war has permitted the bonds of commerce to extend themselves around the civilized world, and nations from remote quarters of the globe have been drawn into that close and mutual dependence which foretold unshackled trade and a lasting peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>Yet, throughout this long discussion, the recesses and vaulted dome of this hall have reechoed to inflammatory appeals and violent declamations on the sanctity of national honor; and then, as if to justify them, followed reflections most discreditable to the conduct of our Government.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>Sir, it has been my pride to believe that our history was unstained by an act of injustice or of perfidy; that we stood recorded before the world as a people haughty to the strong, generous to the weak; and nowhere has this character been more exemplified than in our intercourse with <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5476"/>There are other decisions than those made by commissioners, and sometimes they outlast the letter of a treaty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>On sea and land we settled the question of impressment before negotiations were commenced at <placeName key="tgn,2069379;tgn,2039056;tgn,7007887" n="0.050 000000.3472	placename;tgn,2069379;ghent, columbia, new york,Columbia,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.050 000000.3472	placename;tgn,2039056;ghent, carroll, kentucky,Carroll,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;0.043 000000.2976	placename;tgn,7007887;gent,oost-vlaanderen,vlaanderen,belgie,europe,Oost-Vlaanderen,Vlaanderen,Belgie,Europe" reg="ghent, columbia, new york,Columbia,New York,United States,North and Central America;ghent, carroll, kentucky,Carroll,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America;gent,oost-vlaanderen,vlaanderen,belgie,europe,Oost-Vlaanderen,Vlaanderen,Belgie,Europe">Ghent</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>Further, it should be remembered that there was involved within that question a cardinal principle of each Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5479"/>The power of expatriation, and its sequence, naturalization, were denied by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; and hence a right asserted to impress native-born <persName><foreName>Britons</foreName></persName>, though naturalized as citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5586"/>She, by the terms of annexation, gave to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the right to define her boundary by treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>; but the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in the treaty made with <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName> subsequent to the war with that country, received from <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName> not merely a cession of the territory that was claimed by <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, but much that lay beyond the asserted limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5587"/>Shall we, then, acting simply as the agent of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> in the settlement of this question of boundary, take from the principal for whom we act that territory which belongs to her, to which we asserted her title against <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>, and appropriate it to ourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5588"/>Why, sir, it would be a violation of justice, and of a principle of law which is so plain that it does not require <num value="1">one</num> to have been bred to the profession of law to understand it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>The right of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, therefore, to that boundary was made complete by the treaty of peace, which silenced the only rival claim to the territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>It was distinctly defined by the acts of her Congress, before the time of annexation; and I have only to refer to those acts to show that the boundary of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> was the <rs type="place">Rio Bravo</rs> del Norte, from its mouth to its source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>What justice, <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> or even decent regard for fairness, can there be, now that <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> has acceded to annexation upon certain terms, to propose a change of boundary, in violation of those terms, and by the power we hold over her as a part of the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5593"/>Can this power extend so far as to take from her a portion of her territory, or to assert that there is a portion to which she is not entitled?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5594"/>These constitute with me <num value="2">two</num> great objections to the propositions of the <persName n="Senator,the Honorable,,,," id="n0125.0053.00455.01769" reg="mostcommon:Senator,nomatch:0"><roleName n="the Honorable">honorable</roleName> <surname>Senator</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; but, without stating all the objections that I have, and they are very many, I will merely point out a few of the prominent points to which I object in the argument of the <rs>Senator</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5595"/>He assumes as facts things which are mere matters of opinion, and, I think, of erroneous and injurious opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5597"/>This, though stated as a fact, is but a mere opinion&mdash;an opinion with which I do not accord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>The production of rice, sugar, and cotton, is no better adapted to slave-labor than the digging, washing, and quarrying of the gold-mines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5601"/>We, sir, have not asked that slavery should be established in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/>We have only asked that there should be no restriction; that climate and soil should be left free to establish the institution or not, as experience should determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5603"/>Sir, after the agitation of the subject within these halls and elsewhere has prevented the introduction of slavery&mdash;by preventing the emigration of slaveholders with their property&mdash;are we now to be told that the question is settled?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5604"/>More than that: when we have acquired territory over which the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> is thereby extended, and which the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have a right to occupy, and to establish therein what laws they please, in accordance with the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;in which they have a right to establish what institutions they please&mdash;it is now claimed that the municipal regulations which previously existed shall still govern the people, and that a portion of the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shall thus be precluded from going there with their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5605"/>This rule has, however, in discussion here, only been applied to the property of slaveholders; as though slaves were the only property under the laws of <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName> prohibited from entering <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5606"/>It is to be remembered that the late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, in a report to Congress, stated that the <rs>Mexican</rs> law prohibited the entrance of some <num value="60">sixty</num> articles of commerce; this was prohibition by law of Congress, and slavery has never been so prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5607"/>It never has been prohibited by the <orgName n="Mexican Congress" type="congress">Mexican Congress</orgName> in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>; and the only prohibition ever issued was that contained in the edict of a usurper, under the specious pretext that it was necessary, in order to oppose the invasion of the country by <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5608"/>This decree was recognized by a subsequent Congress, so far as to pass a law authorizing payment for slaves so liberated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5609"/>It was the emancipation of all the slaves in <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>; an act, if you please, of abolition, not of prohibition; not, whatever construction may be placed upon it, done in the forms of law and requirements of their Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5610"/>But we have not proposed to inquire into the legality of the abolition, <pb id="p.456" n="456"/> neither has any Southern man asked that that decree should be repealed, or that those liberated under its provisions should be returned to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5611"/>We only claim that there shall be an equality of immunities and privileges among citizens of all parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; that <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> law shall not be applied so as to create inequality between citizens, by preventing the immigration of any.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5612"/>But, sir, we are called on to receive this as a measure of compromise!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5613"/>Is a measure in which we of the minority are to receive nothing a compromise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5614"/>I look upon it as but a modest mode of taking that, the claim to which has been more boldly asserted by others; and, that I may be understood upon this question, and that my position may go forth to the country in the same columns that convey the sentiments of the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, I here assert that never will I take less than the <rs>Missouri</rs> compromise line extended to the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>, with the specific recognition of the right to hold slaves in the territory below that line; and that, before such Territories are admitted into the <rs>Union</rs> as States, slaves may be taken there from any of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at the option of their owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5615"/>I can never consent to give additional power to a majority to commit further aggressions upon the minority in this Union; and will never consent to any proposition which will have such a tendency, without a full guarantee or counteracting measure is connected with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5618"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>: I rise merely to make a few remarks upon the right of petition, and to notice the error which I think has pervaded the comparisons that have been instituted between certain resolutions which were presented by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and the petition which it is now proposed shall be received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5619"/>The resolutions which were presented from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> were published in yesterday's paper, and, after reading them, I think they refer to a state of case which the people of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> might properly present as their grievance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5620"/>They were resolutions for preserving the <rs>Union</rs>, calling upon Congress to take all measures in its power for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5621"/>This was all legitimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5622"/>They had a right to petition Congress for a redress of grievances; and, if it were in our power to redress those grievances, if it were within the legitimate functions of our legislation, we were bound to receive the petition and respectfully consider it. This case is exactly the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/>Here is no grievance, unless the <rs>Union</rs> is a grievance to those who petition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5624"/>And they call upon Congress to do that which every <num value="1">one</num> must admit Congress has no power to do&mdash;to dissolve peaceably the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5625"/>Then, sir, in the first place, there is no grievance; in the next place, there is no power; and, beyond all that, it is offensive to the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5626"/>It is offensive to recommend legislation for the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;offensive to the <name>Senate</name> and to the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5627"/>If this Union is ever to be dissolved, it must be by the action of the <name>States</name> and their people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5628"/>Whatever power Congress holds, it holds under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and that power is but a part of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5629"/>Congress has <pb id="p.457" n="457"/> no power to legislate upon that which will be the destruction of the whole foundation upon which its authority rests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5630"/>I recollect, a good many years ago, that the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> [<persName n="Davis,Mister,John,,," id="n0125.0053.00457.01773" reg="default:Davis,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>], who addressed the <name>Senate</name> this morning, very pointedly described the right of petition as a very humble right&mdash;as the mere right to beg. This is my own view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5631"/>The right peaceably to assemble, I hold as the right which it was intended to grant to the people; that was the only right which had ever been denied in our colonial condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5632"/>The right of petition had never been denied by Parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5633"/>It was intended only to secure to the people, I say, the right peaceably to assemble, whenever they choose to do so, with intent to petition for a redress of grievances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5634"/>But, sir, the right of petition, though but a poor right&mdash;the mere right to beg&mdash;may yet be carried to such an extent that we are bound to abate it as a nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>If the avenues to the <rs>Capitol</rs> were to be obstructed, so that members would find themselves unable to reach the halls of legislation, because hordes of beggars presented themselves in the way calling for relief, it would be a nuisance that would require to be abated, and Congress, in self-defense, would be compelled to remove them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5636"/>But such a collection of beggars would not be half so great an evil as the petitions presented here on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5637"/>They disturb the peace of the country; they impede and pervert legislation by the excitement they create; they do more to prevent rational investigation and proper action in this body than any, if not all, other causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5638"/>Good, if ever designed, has never resulted, and it would be difficult to suppose that good is expected ever to flow from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/>Why, then, should we be bound to receive such petitions to the detriment of the public business; or, rather, why are they presented?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>I am not of those who believe we should be turned from the path of duty by out-of-door clamor, or that the evil can be removed by partial concession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/>To receive is to give cause for further demands, and our direct and safe course is rejection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>Yes, sir, their reception would serve only to embarrass Congress, to disturb the tranquillity of the country, and to peril the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>By every obligation, therefore, that rests upon us under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, upon every great principle upon which the <rs>Constitution</rs> is founded, we are bound to abate this as a great and growing evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5644"/>This petition, sir, was well described by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> as being spurious; and I have been assured of the fact, from other sources of information, that petitions are sent round in reference to other subjects &mdash;of temperance, generally&mdash;and, after a long list of names has been obtained, the caption is cut off, and the list of signatures attached to an abolition caption and sent here to excite <num value="1">one</num> section of the <rs>Union</rs> against the other, to disturb the country, and distract the legislation of Congress, to execute which we have our seats in this Chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/>For the reasons <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stated, I voted to receive the resolutions that were presented by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and for the reasons I have just given shall vote to reject this petition.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5647"/>. . . Sir, it has been asked on several occasions during the present session,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5648"/>What ground of complaint has the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>Is this agitation in the <num value="2">two</num> halls of <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> Congress, in relation to the domestic institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, no subject for complaint?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>Is the denunciation heaped upon us by the press of the <rs>North</rs>, and the attempts to degrade us in the eyes of Christendom&mdash;to arraign the character of our people and the character of our fathers, from whom our institutions are derived&mdash;no subject for complaint?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5651"/>Is this sectional organization, for the purpose of hostility to our portion of the <rs>Union</rs>, no subject for complaint?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5652"/>Would it not, between foreign nations&mdash;nations not bound together and restrained as we are by compact&mdash;would it not, I say, be just cause for war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5653"/>What difference is there between organizations for circulating incendiary documents and promoting the escape of fugitives from a neighboring State and the organization of an armed force for the purpose of invasion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5654"/>Sir, a State relying securely on its own strength would rather court the open invasion than the insidious attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5655"/>And for what end, sir, is all this aggression?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5656"/>They see that the slaves in their present condition in the <rs>South</rs> are comfortable and happy; they see them advancing in intelligence; they see the kindest relations existing between them and their masters; they see them provided for in age and sickness, in infancy and in disability; they see them in useful employment, restrained from the vicious indulgences to which their inferior nature inclines them; they see our penitentiaries never filled, and our poor-houses usually empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5657"/>Let them turn to the other hand, and they see the same race in a state of freedom at the <rs>North</rs>; but, instead of the comfort and kindness they receive at the <rs>South</rs>, instead of being happy and useful, they are, with few exceptions, miserable, degraded, filling the penitentiaries and poorhouses, objects of scorn, excluded in some places from the schools, and deprived of many other privileges and benefits which attach to the white men among whom they live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5658"/>And yet, they insist that elsewhere an institution which has proved beneficial to this race shall be abolished, that it may be substituted by a state of things which is fraught with so many evils to the race which they claim to be the object of their solicitude!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/>Do they find in the history of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, and in the present condition of <placeName reg="Jamaica, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005556">Jamaica</placeName>, under the recent experiments which have been made upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the liberation of the blacks, before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in his wisdom, designed it should be done&mdash;do they there find anything to stimulate them to future exertion in the cause of abolition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>Or should they not find there satisfactory evidence that their past course was founded in error?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>And is it not the part of integrity and wisdom, as soon as they can, to retrace their steps?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5662"/>Should they not immediately cease from a course mischievous in every stage, and finally tending to the greatest catastrophe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5663"/>We may dispute about measures, but, as long as parties have nationality, as long as it is a difference of opinion between individuals passing into every section of the country, it threatens no danger to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5664"/>If the conflicts of party were the only cause of apprehension, this Government might last for ever&mdash;the last page of human history might contain a discussion in the <orgName n="American Congress" type="congress">American Congress</orgName> upon the meaning of some phrase, the extent of the power conferred by some grant of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5665"/>It is, sir, these sectional divisions which weaken the bonds of union and threaten their final rupture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5666"/>It is not differences of opinion&mdash;it is geographical lines, rivers and mountains&mdash;which divide State from State, and make different nations of mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5667"/>Are these no subjects of complaint for us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5668"/>And do they furnish no cause for repentence to you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>Have we not a right to appeal to you as brethren of this <pb id="p.459" n="459"/> Union?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>Have we not a right to appeal to you, as brethren bound by the compact of our fathers, that you should, with due regard to your own rights and interests and constitutional obligations, do all that is necessary to preserve our peace and promote our prosperity?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>If, sir, the seeds of disunion have been sown broadcast over this land, I ask by whose hand they have been scattered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>If, sir, we are now reduced to a condition when the powers of this Government are held subservient to faction; if we can not and dare not legislate for the organization of territorial governments&mdash;I ask, sir, who is responsible for it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>And I can with proud reliance say, it is not the <rs>South</rs>&mdash;it is not the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>Sir, every charge of disunion which is made on that part of the <rs>South</rs> which I in part represent, and whose sentiments I well understand, I here pronounce to be grossly calumnious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>The conduct of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> in calling a convention has already been introduced before the <name>Senate</name>; and on that occasion I stated, and now repeat, that it was the result of patriotism, and a high resolve to preserve, if possible, our <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional Union</orgName>; that all its proceedings were conducted with deliberation, and it was composed of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> men of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5676"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</rs>&mdash;a man well known for his high integrity, for his powerful intellect, for his great legal attainments, and his ability in questions of constitutional law&mdash;presided over that Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5677"/>After calm and mature deliberation, resolutions were adopted, not in the spirit of disunion, but announcing, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolution of the series, their attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5678"/>They call on their brethren of the <rs>South</rs> to unite with them in their holy purpose of preserving the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which is its only bond and reliable hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5679"/>This was their object; and for this and for no other purpose do they propose to meet in <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general convention</orgName> at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5680"/>As I stated on a former occasion, this was not a party movement in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5681"/>The presiding officer belongs to the political minority in the <rs>State</rs>; the <num value="2">two</num> parties in the <rs>State</rs> were equally represented in the numbers of the <rs>Convention</rs>, and its deliberations assumed no partisan or political character whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5682"/>It was the result of primary meetings in the counties; an assemblage of men known throughout the <rs>State</rs>, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met and intimated to those counties a time when the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> should, if deemed proper, be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5683"/>Every movement was taken into deliberation, and every movement then taken was wholly independent of the action of anybody else; unless it be intended, by the remarks made here, to refer its action to the great principles of those who have gone before us, and who have left us the rich legacy of the free institutions under which we live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5684"/>If it be attempted to assign the movement to the nullification tenets of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, as my friend near me seemed to understand, then I say you must go further back, and impute it to the <rs>State</rs> rights and strict-construction doctrines of <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0125.0053.00459.01776" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0125.0053.00459.01777" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5685"/>You must refer these in their turn to the principles in which originated the <name>Revolution</name> and separation of these then colonies from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>You must not stop there, but go back still further, to the bold spirit of the ancient barons of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>That spirit has come down to us, and in that spirit has all the action since been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5688"/>We will not permit aggressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5689"/>We will defend our rights; and, if it be necessary, we will claim from this Government, as the barons of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> claimed from <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, the grant of another <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Magna Charta" type="document">Magna Charta</rs></hi> for our protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5690"/><pb id="p.460" n="460"/></p> 
<p>Sir, I can but consider it as a tribute of respect to the character for candor and sincerity which the <rs>South</rs> maintains, that every movement which occurs in the <rs>Southern States</rs> is closely scrutinized, and the assertion of a determination to maintain their constitutional rights is denounced as a movement of disunion; while violent denunciations against the <rs>Union</rs> are now made, and for years have been made, at the <rs>North</rs> by associations, by presses and conventions, yet are allowed to pass unnoticed as the idle wind&mdash;I suppose for the simple reason that nobody believed there was any danger in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5691"/>It is, then, I say, a tribute paid to the sincerity of the <rs>South</rs>, that every movement of hers is watched with such jealousy; but what shall we think of the love for the <rs>Union</rs> of those in whom this brings us corresponding change of conduct, who continue the wanton aggravations which have produced and justify the action they deprecate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5692"/>Is it well, is it wise, is it safe, to disregard these manifestations of public displeasure, though it be the displeasure of a minority?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5693"/>Is it proper, or prudent, or respectful, when a representative, in accordance with the known will of his constituents, addresses you the language of solmen warning, in conformity to his duty to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the <rs>Union</rs>, and to his own conscience, that his course should be arraigned as the declaration of ultra and dangerous opinions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5694"/>If these warnings were received in the spirit in which they are given, it would augur better for the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5695"/>It would give hopes which are now denied us, if the press of the country, that great lever of public opinion, would enforce these warnings, and bear them to every cottage, instead of heaping abuse upon those whose love of ease would prompt them to silence&mdash;whose speech, therefore, is evidence of sincerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5696"/>Lightly and loosely, representatives of Southern people have been denounced as disunionists by that portion of the <rs>Northern</rs> press which most disturbs the harmony and endangers the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5697"/>Such, even, has been my own case, though the man does not breathe at whose door the charge of disunion might not as well be laid as at mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5698"/>The son of a Revolutionary soldier, attachment to this Union was among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons of my childhood; bred to the service of my country, from boyhood to mature age, I wore its uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5699"/>Through the brightest portion of my life I was accustomed to see our flag, historic emblem of the <rs>Union</rs>, rise with the rising and fall with the setting sun. I look upon it now with the affection of early love, and seek to preserve it by a strict adherence to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, from which it had its birth, and by the nurture of which its stars have come so much to outnumber its original stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5700"/>Shall that flag, which has gathered fresh glory in every war, and become more radiant still by the conquest of peace&mdash;shall that flag now be torn by domestic faction, and trodden in the dust by sectional rivalry?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/>Shall we of the <rs>South</rs>, who have shared equally with you all your toils, all your dangers, all your adversities, and who equally rejoice in your prosperity and your fame&mdash;shall we be denied those benefits guaranteed by our compact, or gathered as the common fruits of a common country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>If so, self-respect requires that we should assert them; and, as best we may, maintain that which we could not surrender without losing your respect as well as our own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>If, sir, this spirit of sectional aggrandizement&mdash;or, if gentlemen prefer, this love they bear the <name>African</name> race&mdash;shall cause the disunion of these States, the last chapter of our history will be a sad commentary upon the justice and the wisdom of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>That this Union, replete with blessings to its own citizens, and <pb id="p.461" n="461"/> diffusive of hope to the rest of mankind, should fall a victim to a selfish aggrandizement and a pseudo-philanthropy, prompting <num value="1">one</num> portion of the <rs>Union</rs> to war upon the domestic rights and peace of another, would be a deep reflection on the good sense and patriotism of our day and generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>But, sir, if this last chapter in our history shall ever be written, the reflective reader will ask, Whence proceeded this hostility of the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5706"/>He will find it there recorded that the <rs>South</rs>, in opposition to her own immediate interests, engaged with the <rs>North</rs> in the unequal struggle of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5707"/>He will find again, that, when Northern seamen were impressed, their brethren of the <rs>South</rs> considered it cause for war, and entered warmly into the contest with the haughty power then claiming to be mistress of the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5708"/>He will find that the <rs>South</rs>, afar off, unseen and unheard, toiling in the pursuits of agriculture, had filled the shipping and supplied the staple for manufactures, which enriched the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5709"/>He will find that she was the great consumer of Northern fabrics&mdash;that she not only paid for these their fair value in the markets of the world, but that she also paid their increased value, derived from the imposition of revenue duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5710"/>And, if, still further, he seeks for the cause of this hostility, it at last is to be found in the fact that the <rs>South</rs> held the <name>African</name> race in bondage, being the descendants of those who were mainly purchased from the people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5711"/>And this was the great cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5712"/>For this the <rs>North</rs> claimed that the <rs>South</rs> should be restricted from future growth&mdash;that around her should be drawn, as it were, a sanitary cordon to prevent the extension of a <quote>moral leprosy</quote>; and, if for that it shall be written that the <rs>South</rs> resisted, it would be but in keeping with every page she has added to the history of our country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5713"/>It depends on those in the majority to say whether this last chapter in our history shall be written or not. It depends on them now to decide whether the strife between the different sections shall be arrested before it has become impossible, or whether it shall proceed to a final catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5714"/>I, sir&mdash;and I only speak for myself&mdash;am willing to meet any fair proposition&mdash;to settle upon anything which promises security for the future; anything which assures me of permanent peace, and I am willing to make whatever sacrifice I may properly be called on to render for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5715"/>Nor, sir, is it a light responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5716"/>If I strictly measured my conduct by the late message of the <rs>Governor</rs>, and the recent expressions of opinion in my State, I should have no power to accept any terms save the unqualified admission of the equal rights of the citizens of the <rs>South</rs> to go into any of the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with any and every species of property held among us. I am willing, however, to take my share of the responsibility which the crisis of our country demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5717"/>I am willing to rely on the known love of the people I represent for the whole country, and the abiding respect which I know they entertain for the <rs>Union</rs> of these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5718"/>If, sir, I distrusted their attachment to our Government, and if I believed that they had that restless spirit of disunion which has been ascribed to the <rs>South</rs>, I should know full well that I had no such foundation as this to rely upon&mdash;no such great reserve in the heart of the people to fall back upon in the hour of accountability.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5726"/>Grass will grow on the pavements now worn by the constant tread of the human throng which waits on commerce, and the shipping will abandon your ports for those which now furnish the staples of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5729"/>But, sir, I have no disposition to follow this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>I certainly can derive no pleasure from the contemplation of anything which can impair the prosperity of any portion of this Union; and I only refer to it that those who suppose we are tied by interest or fear should look the question in the face and understand that it is mainly a feeling of attachment to the <rs>Union</rs> which has long bound, and now binds, the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5731"/>But, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, I ask <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to consider how long affection can be proof against such trial, and injury, and provocation, as the <rs>South</rs> is continually receiving.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>The case in which this discrimination against the <rs>South</rs> is attempted, the circumstances under which it was introduced, render it especially offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>It will not be difficult to imagine the feeling with which a Southern soldier during the <rs>Mexican</rs> war received the announcement that the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> had passed that odious measure, the <rs>Wilmot Proviso</rs>; and that he, although then periling his life, abandoning all the comforts of home, and sacrificing his interests, was, by the <name>Legislature</name> of his country, marked as coming from a portion of the <rs>Union</rs> which was not entitled to the equal benefits of whatever might result from the service to which he was contributing whatever power he possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>Nor will it be difficult to conceive, of the many sons of the <rs>South</rs> whose blood has stained those battle-fields, whose ashes now mingle with <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> earth, that some when they last looked on the flag of their country, may have felt their dying moments embittered by the recollection that that flag cast not an equal shadow of protection over the land of their birth, the graves of their parents, and the homes of their children, so soon to be orphans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>Sir, I ask Northern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> to make the case their own&mdash;to carry to their own firesides the idea of such intrusion and offensive discrimination as is offered to us&mdash;realize these irritations, so galling to the humble, so intolerable to the haughty, and wake, before it is too late, from the dream that the <rs>South</rs> will tamely submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5736"/>Measure the consequences to us of your assumption, and ask yourselves whether, as a free, honorable, and brave people, you would submit to it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5737"/><pb id="p.463" n="463"/></p> 
<p>It is essentially the characteristic of the chivalrous that they never speculate upon the fears of any man, and I trust that no such speculations will be made upon the idea that may be entertained in any quarter that the <rs>South</rs>, from fear of her slaves, is necessarily opposed to a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5738"/>She has no such fear; her slaves would be to her now, as they were in the <name>Revolution</name>, an element of military strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5739"/>I trust that no speculations will be made upon either the condition or the supposed weakness of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5740"/>They will bring sad disappointments to those who indulge them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5744"/>It is for those who are threatening us with the loss of that which we are entitled to enjoy, to state, if there be any compromise, what that compromise is. We are unable to pass any measure, if we propose it; therefore I have none to suggest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5745"/>We are unable to bend you to any terms which we may offer; we are under the ban of your purpose; therefore from you, if from anywhere, the proposition must come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>I wish to express not only my concurrence with the message of the <rs>President</rs>, but my hearty approbation of the high motive which actuated him when he wrote it. In that paper breathes the sentiment of a patriot, and it stands out in bold contrast with the miserable slang by which he was pursued this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>It may serve the purposes of a man who little regards the <rs>Union</rs> to perpetrate a joke on the hazard of its dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/>It ill becomes such a man to point to Southern institutions as to him a moral leprosy, which he is to pursue to the end of extermination, and, perverting everything, ancient and modern, to bring it tributary to his own malignant purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>Not even could that clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which refers to the importation or migration of persons be held up to public consideration by the <rs>Senator</rs> [<persName n="Fessenden,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0054.00465.01781" reg="mostcommon:Fessenden,&mdash;,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fessenden</surname></persName>] in a studied argument, save as a permission for the slave-trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>Then, everything that is most prominent in relation to the protection of property in that instrument he holds to have been swept away by a statute which prohibited the further importation of Africans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5761"/>The language of that clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is far broader than the importation of Africans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5762"/>It is not confined or limited at all to that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5763"/>It says:</p>

<p>That was a power given to Congress far broader than the slave-trade; and yet the <rs>Senator</rs> gravely argues that, when that prohibition against the further importation of Africans took place by act of Congress, thenceforward the constitutional shield, which had been thrown over slave property, fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5770"/>A man not knowing into what presence he was introduced, coming into this <pb id="p.466" n="466"/> Chamber, might, for a large part of this session, have supposed that here stood the representatives of belligerent States, and that, instead of men assembled here to confer together for the common welfare, for the general good, he saw here ministers from States preparing to make war upon each other; and then he would have felt that vain, indeed, was the vaunting of the prowess of <num value="1">one</num> to destroy another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>Jointly we held it, jointly we enjoyed it in the earlier period of our country; but when, in the progress of years, it became apparent that it could not longer be enjoyed in peace, the men of that day took upon themselves, wisely or unwisely, a power which the <rs>Constitution</rs> did not confer, and, by a geographical line, determined to divide the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, so that the common field, which brothers could not cultivate in peace, should be held severally for the benefit of each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>Wisely or unwisely, that law was denied extension to the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>I, for <num value="1">one</num>, never believed Congress had the power to pass that law; yet, as <num value="1">one</num> who was willing to lay down much then, as I am now, to the peace, the harmony, <pb id="p.467" n="467"/> and the welfare of our common country, I desired to see that line extended to the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>, and that strife which now agitates the country never renewed; but with a distinct declaration: <quote>Go ye to the right, and we will go to the left; and we go in peace and good &mdash; will toward each other.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>Those who refused then to allow the extension of that line, those who declared then that it was a violation of principle, and insisted on what they termed non-intervention, must have stood with very poor grace in the same Chamber when, at a subsequent period, the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> [<persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0054.00467.01787" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>], bound by his honor on account of his previous course, moved the repeal of that line to throw open <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>; they must have stood with very bad grace, in this presence, to argue that that line was now sacred, and must be kept for ever.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>But, sir, was it then understood by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, or anybody else, that throwing open the <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Territory of Kansas</placeName> to free emigration was to be the signal for the marching of cohorts from <num value="1">one</num> section or another to fight on that battlefield for mastery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>Or, did he not rather think that emigration was to be allowed to take its course, and soil and climate be permitted to decide the great question?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/>We were willing to abide by it. We were willing to leave natural causes to decide the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5900"/>I pray you, gentlemen, to reflect upon the different methods by which these nominations were presented to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5980"/>Where will you go and not meet some monument to inspire such sentiments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5988"/>You ask your legend, and learn that it was cut down for firewood by <name>British</name> soldiers, as some of your meetinghouses were destroyed; they burned the old tree, and it warmed the soldiers long enough to leave town, and, had they burned it a little longer, its light would have shown <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and his followers where their enemies were.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5992"/>American fortifications are not built from any fear of invasion, they are intended to guard points where marine attacks can be made; and, for the rest, the hearts of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00480.01836" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> are our ramparts.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5993"/>But, my friends, it is not merely in these associations, so connected with the honorable pride of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, that <num value="1">one</num> who visits <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> finds much for gratification, hope, and instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5994"/>If I were selecting a place where the advocate of strict construction, the extreme expounder of democratic State-rights doctrine should go for his texts, I would send him into the collections of your historical associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5995"/>Instead of going to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> as a place where only consolidation would be found, he would find written, in letters of living light, that sacred creed of State rights which has been miscalled the ultra opinions of the <rs>South</rs>; he could find among your early records that this <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName>, the property of the town at the time when <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was under a colonial government, administered by a man appointed by the <rs>British</rs> crown, guarded by <name>British</name> soldiers, was refused to a British Governor in which to hold a British festival, because he was going to bring with him the agents for collecting, and naval officers sent here to enforce, <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> an oppressive tax upon your Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5996"/>Such was the proud spirit of independence manifested even in your colonial history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5997"/>Such is the great foundation-stone on which may be erected an eternal monument of State rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5998"/>And so, in an early period of our country, you find <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> leading the movements, prominent of all the <name>States</name>, in the assertion of that doctrine which has been recently so much belied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5999"/>Having achieved your independence, having passed through the <name>Confederation</name>, you assented to the formation of our present <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6000"/>You did not surrender your sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>Your fathers had sacrificed too much to claim, as a reward of their toil, merely that they should have a change of masters; and a change of masters it would have been had <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> surrendered her State sovereignty to the central Government, and consented that that central Government should have the power to coerce a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>But, if this power does not exist, if this sovereignty has not been surrendered, then, who can deny the words of soberness and truth spoken by your candidate this evening, when he has pleaded to you the cause of State independence, and the right of every community to be judge of its own domestic affairs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/>This is all we have ever asked&mdash;we of the <rs>South</rs>, I mean&mdash;for I stand before you as <num value="1">one</num> of those who have always been called the ultra men of the <rs>South</rs>, and I speak, therefore, for that class; and I tell you that your candidate for Governor has uttered to-night everything which we have claimed as a principle for our protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>And I have found the same condition of things in the neighboring <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">State of Maine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>I have found that the <name>Democrats</name> there asserted the same broad constitutional principle for which we have been contending, by which we are willing to live, for which we are willing to die!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>In this state of the case, my friends, why is the country agitated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>The old controversies have passed away, or they have subsided, and have been covered up by <num value="1">one</num> dark pall of somber hue, which increases with every passing year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>Why is it, then, I say, that you are thus agitated in relation to the domestic affairs of other communities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>Why is it that the peace of the country is disturbed in order that <num value="1">one</num> people may judge of what another people may do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>Is there any political power to authorize such interference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>If so, where is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>You did not surrender your sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6013"/>You gave to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> certain functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/>It was your agent, created for specified purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>It can do nothing save that which you have given it power to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>Where is the grant?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>Has it a right to determine what shall be property?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>Surely not; that belongs to every community to decide for itself; you judge in your case&mdash;every other State must judge in its case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>The Federal Government has no power to destroy property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>Do you pay taxes, then, to an agent, that he may destroy your property?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6021"/>Do you support him for that purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6022"/>It is an absurdity on the face of it. To ask the question is to answer it. The Government is instituted to protect, not to destroy, property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6023"/>And, in abundance of caution, your fathers provided that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> should not take private property for its own use unless by making due compensation therefor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6024"/>It is prohibited from attempting to destroy property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6025"/><num value="1">One</num> of its great purposes was protection to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6026"/>Whenever that power is made a source of danger, we destroy the purpose for which the <rs>Government</rs> was formed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6027"/>Why, then, have you agitators?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6028"/>With Pharisaical pretension it is sometimes said it is a moral obligation to agitate, and I suppose they are going through a sort of vicarious repentance for other men's sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6029"/>With all due allowance for <pb id="p.482" n="482"/> their zeal, we ask, how do they decide that it is a sin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6030"/>By what standard do they measure it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6031"/>Not the <rs>Constitution</rs>; the <rs>Constitution</rs> recognizes the property in slaves in many forms, and imposes obligations in connection with that recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6032"/>Not the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>; that justifies it. Not the good of society; for, if they go where it exists, they find that society recognizes it as good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6033"/>What, then, is their standard?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6034"/>The good of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6035"/>Is that seen in the diminished resources of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6036"/>Is that seen in the diminished comfort of the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6037"/>Or is not the reverse exhibited?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6038"/>Is there, in the cause of Christianity, a motive for the prohibition of the system which is the only agency through which Christianity has reached that inferior race, the only means by which they have been civilized and elevated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6039"/>Or is their piety manifested in denunciation of their brethren, who are deterred from answering their denunciation only by the contempt which they feel for a mere brawler, who intends to end his brawling only in empty words?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6040"/>What, my friends, must be the consequences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6041"/>Good or evil?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/>They have been evil, and evil they must be only to the end. Not <num value="1">one</num> particle of good has been done to any man, of any color, by this agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6043"/>It has been insidiously working the purpose of sedition, for the destruction of that Union on which our hopes of future greatness depend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6044"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> side, then, you see agitation tending slowly and steadily to that separation of States, which, if you have any hope connected with the liberty of mankind; if you have any national pride connected with making your country the greatest on the face of the earth; if you have any sacred regard for the obligations which the deeds and the blood of your fathers entailed upon you, that hope should prompt you to reject anything that would tend to destroy the result of that experiment which they left it to you to conclude and perpetuate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6045"/>On the other hand, if each community, in accordance with the principles of our Government, should regard its domestic interests as a part of the common whole, and struggle for the benefit of all, this would steadily lead us to fraternity, to unity, to cooperation, to the increase of our happiness and the extension of the benefits of our useful example over mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6046"/>The flag of the <rs>Union</rs>, whose stars have already more than doubled their original number, with its ample folds may wave, the recognized flag of every State or the recognized protector of every State upon the <name>Continent</name> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6047"/>In connection with the view which I have presented of the early idea of community independence, I will add the very striking fact that <num value="1">one</num> of the colonies, about the time they had resolved to unite for the purpose of achieving their independence, addressed the <orgName n="Colonial Congress" type="congress">Colonial Congress</orgName> to know in what condition it would be in the interval between its separation from the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and the establishment of a government on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6048"/>The answer of the <orgName n="Colonial Congress" type="congress">Colonial Congress</orgName> was exactly what might have been expected&mdash;exactly what State-rights Democracy would answer to-day to such an inquiry&mdash;that they <quote>had nothing to do with it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6049"/>If such sentiment had continued, if it had governed in every State, if representatives had been chosen upon it, then your halls of Federal legislation would not have been disturbed about the question of the domestic institutions of the different States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6050"/>The peace of the country would not be hazarded by the arraignment of the family relations of people over whom the <rs>Government</rs> has no control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>If in harmony working together, with co-intelligence for the conservation of the interests of the country&mdash;if protection to the <name>States</name> and the <pb id="p.483" n="483"/> other great ends for which the <rs>Government</rs> was established, had been the aim and united effort of all&mdash;what effects would not have been produced?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6052"/>As our Government increases in expansion it would increase in its beneficent effect upon the people; we should, as we grow in power and prosperity, also grow in fraternity, and it would be no longer a wonder to see a man coming from a Southern State to address a Democratic audience in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6053"/>But I have referred to the fact that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> stood preeminently forward among those who asserted community independence: and this reminds me of another incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6054"/><persName n="Washington,President,,,," id="n0125.0055.00483.01837" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> visited <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> when <placeName reg="John Hancock">John Hancock</placeName> was Governor, and <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00483.01838" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> refused to call upon the <rs>President</rs>, because he contended that any man who came within the limits of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> must yield rank and precedence to the <rs>Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6055"/>He eventually only surrendered the point on account of his personal regard and respect for the character of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0125.0055.00483.01839" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6056"/>I honor him for this, and value it as <num value="1">one</num> of the early testimonies in favor of State rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6057"/>I wish all our Governors had the same regard for the dignity of the <rs>State</rs> as had the great and glorious <placeName reg="John Hancock">John Hancock</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6058"/>In the beginning the founders of this Government were true democratic State-rights men. Democracy was State rights, and State rights was democracy, and it is to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6059"/>Your resolutions breathe it. The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> embodied the sentiments which had lived in the hearts of the country for many years before its formal assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6060"/>Our fathers asserted the great principle&mdash;the right of the people to choose their own government&mdash;and that government rested upon the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6061"/>In every form of expression it uttered the same idea, community independence and the dependence of the <rs>Union</rs> upon the communities of which it consisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6062"/>It was an American declaration of the unalienable right of man; it was a general truth, and I wish it were accepted by all men. But I have said that this State sovereignty&mdash;this community independence&mdash;has never been surrendered, and that there is no power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to coerce a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6063"/>Will any <num value="1">one</num> ask me, then, how a State is to be held to the fulfillment of its obligations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6064"/>My answer is, by its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6065"/>The obligation is the more sacred to observe every feature of the compact, because there is no power to enforce it. The great error of the <name>Confederation</name> was, that it attempted to act upon the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6066"/>It was found impracticable, and our present form of government was adopted, which acts upon individuals, and is not designed to act upon States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6067"/>The question of State coercion was raised in the <rs>Convention</rs> which framed the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and, after discussion, the proposition to give power to the <rs>General Government</rs> to enforce against any State obedience to the laws was rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6068"/>It is upon the ground that a State can not be coerced that observance of the compact is a sacred obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6069"/>It was upon this principle that our fathers depended for the perpetuity of a fraternal Union, and for the security of the rights that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was designed to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6070"/>The fugitive slave compact in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> implied that the <name>States</name> should fulfill it voluntarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6071"/>They expected the <name>States</name> to legislate so as to secure the rendition of fugitives; and in <dateStruct value="1778--"><year reg="1778">1778</year></dateStruct> it was a matter of complaint that the <rs>Spanish</rs> colony of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> did not restore fugitive negroes from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who escaped into that colony, and a committee, composed of <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00483.01840" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,Alexander,,,:2"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, of New York, <persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00483.01841" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00483.01842" reg="mostcommon:Mason,George,,,:1"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, reported resolutions in the <rs>Congress</rs>, instructing the <rs>Secretary</rs> of Foreign Affairs to address the charge d'affaires at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> to apply <pb id="p.484" n="484"/> to <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> to issue orders to his governor to compel them to secure the rendition of fugitive negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6072"/>This was the sentiment of the committee, and they added, also, that the <name>States</name> would return any slaves from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> who might escape into their limits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6073"/>When the constitutional obligation was imposed, who could have doubted that every State, faithful to its obligations, would comply with the requirements of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and waive all questions as to whether the institution should or should not exist in another community over which they had no control?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6074"/>Congress was at last forced to legislate on the subject, and they have continued, up to a recent period, to legislate, and this has been <num value="1">one</num> of the causes by which you have been disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6075"/>You have been called upon to make war against a law which need never to have been enacted, if each State had done the duty which she was called upon by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to perform.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6076"/>Gentlemen, this presents <num value="1">one</num> phase of agitation&mdash;negro agitation: there is another and graver question, it is in relation to the prohibition by Congress of the introduction of slave property into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6077"/>What power does Congress possess in this connection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6078"/>Has it the right to say what shall be property anywhere?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6079"/>If it has, from what clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> does it derive that power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6080"/>Have other States the power to prescribe the condition upon which a citizen of another State shall enter upon and enjoy territory&mdash;common property of all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6081"/>Clearly not. Shall the inhabitants who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> go into the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> deprive any citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of those rights which belong to him as an equal owner of the soil?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6082"/>Certainly not. Sovereign jurisdiction can only pass to these inhabitants when the <name>States</name>, the owners of that Territory shall recognize their right to become an equal member of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6083"/>Until then, the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws of the <rs>Union</rs> must be the rule governing within the limits of a Territory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/>The Constitution recognizes all property, and gives equal privileges to every citizen of the <name>States</name>; and it would be a violation of its fundamental principles to attempt any discrimination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6085"/>There is nothing of truth or justice with which to sustain this agitation, or ground for it, unless it be that it is a very good bridge over which to pass into office; a little stock of trade in politics built up to aid men who are missionaries staying at home; reformers of things which they do not go to learn; preachers without a congregation; overseers without laborers and without wages; war-horses who snuff the battle afar off and cry: <quote>Aha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6086"/>Aha! I am afar off.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/></p> 
<p>Thus it is that the peace of the <rs>Union</rs> is disturbed; thus it is that brother is arrayed against brother; thus it is that the people come to consider not how they can promote each other's interest, but how they may successfully war upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>And among the things most odious to my mind is to find a man who enters upon a public office, under the sanction of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and taking an oath to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;the compact between the <name>States</name> binding each for the common defense and general welfare of the other&mdash;and retaining to himself a mental reservation that he will war upon the institutions and the property of any of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6089"/>It is a crime too low to characterize as it deserves before this assembly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6090"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> which would disgrace a gentleman&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> which a man with self-respect would never commit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>To swear that he will support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to take an office which belongs in many of its relations to all the <name>States</name>, and to use it as a means of injuring a portion of the <name>States</name> of whom he is thus an <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> agent, is treason to everything that is honorable in man. It is the base and cowardly attack of him who gains the confidence of another in order that he may wound him. But I have often heard it argued, and I have seen it published: I have seen a petition that was circulated for signers, announcing that there was an incompatibility between the different sections of the <rs>Union</rs>; that it had been tried long enough, and that they must get rid of those sections in which the curse of slavery existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6092"/>Ah! those sages, so much wiser than our fathers, have found out that there is incompatibility in that which existed when the <rs>Union</rs> was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6093"/>They have found an incompatibility inconsistent with union, in that which existed when <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> sent her rice to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and New York brought in their funds for her relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6094"/>The fact is that, from that day to this, the difference between the people of the colonies has been steadily diminishing, and the possible advantages of union in no small degree augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>The variety of product of soil and of climate has been multiplied, both by the expansion of our country and by the introduction of new tropical products not cultivated at that time; so that every motive to union which your fathers had, in a diversity which should give prosperity to the country, exists in a higher degree to-day than when this Union was formed, and this diversity is fundamental to the prosperity of the people of the several sections of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6096"/>It is, however, to-day, in sentiment and interest, less than on the day when the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>Diversity there is&mdash;diversity of character&mdash;but it is not of that extreme kind which proves incompatibility; for your <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> man, when he comes into <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, adopts our opinions and our institutions, and frequently becomes the most extreme man among us. As our country has extended, as new products have been introduced into it, this Union and the free trade that belongs to it have been of increasing value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>And I say, moreover, that it is not an unfortunate circumstance that this diversity of pursuit and character still remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/>Originally it sprang in no small degree from natural causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> became a manufacturing and commercial State because of her fine harbors&mdash;because of her water-power, making its last leap into the sea, so that the ship of commerce brought the staple to the manufacturing power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>This made you a commercial and a manufacturing people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/>In the <rs>Southern States</rs> great plains interpose between the last leaps of the streams and the sea. Those plains were cultivated in staple crops, and the sea brought their products to your streams to be manufactured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> beginning of the differences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>Then your longer and more severe winters, your soil not so favorable for agriculture, in a degree kept you a manufacturing and a commercial people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>Even after the cause had passed away&mdash;after railroads had been built&mdash;after the steam-engine had become a motive power for a large part of manufacturing machinery, the natural causes from which your people obtained a manufacturing ascendancy and ours became chiefly agriculturists continued to act in a considerable measure to preserve that relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>Your interest is to remain a manufacturing, and ours to remain an agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>Your prosperity, then, is to receive our staple and to manufacture it, and ours to sell it to you and buy the manufactured goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>This is an interweaving of interests which makes us all the richer and happier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>But this accursed agitation, this intermeddling with the affairs of other people, is that alone which will promote a desire in the mind of any <num value="1">one</num> to separate these great and glorious States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>The seeds of dissension may be sown by invidious <pb id="p.486" n="486"/> reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>Men may be goaded by the constant attempts to infringe upon rights and to disturb tranquillity, and in the resentment which follows it is not possible to tell how far the way may rush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>I therefore plead to you now to arrest a fanaticism which has been evil in the beginning and must be evil in the end. You may not have the numerical power requisite; and those at a distance may not understand how many of you there are desirous to put a stop to the course of this agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>For me, I have learned since I have been in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> the vast mass of true State-rights Democrats to be found within its limits&mdash;though not represented in the halls of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>And if it comes to the worst&mdash;if, availing themselves of a majority in the two Houses of Congress, they should attempt to trample upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>; if they should attempt to violate the rights of the <name>States</name>; if they should attempt to infringe upon our equality in the <rs>Union</rs>&mdash;I believe that even in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, though it has not had a representative in Congress for many a day, the State-rights Democracy, in whose breast beats the spirit of the <name>Revolution</name>, can and will whip the black Republicans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/>I trust we shall never be thus purified, as it were, by fire; but that the peaceful, progressive revolution of the ballot-box will answer all the glorious purposes of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>And I marked that the distinguished orator and statesman who preceded me, in addressing you, used the words <quote>national</quote> and <quote>constitutional</quote> in such relation to each other as to show that in his mind the <num value="1">one</num> was a synonym of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/>I say so: we become national by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the bond for uniting the <name>States</name>, and national and constitutional are convertible terms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>Your candidate for the high <orgName>office of Governor</orgName>&mdash;whom I have been once or twice on the point of calling Governor, and whom I hope I may be able soon to call so&mdash;in his remarks to you has presented the same idea in another form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>And well may <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> orators, without even perceiving what they are saying, utter sentiments which lie at the foundation of your colonial as well as your subsequent political history, which existed in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> before the <name>Revolution</name>, and have existed ever since, whenever the true spirit which comes down from the <name>Revolutionary</name> sires has swelled and found utterance within her limits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>It has been not only, my friends, in this increasing and mutual dependence of interest that we have found new ties to you. Those bonds are both material and mental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>Every improvement or invention, every construction of a railroad, has formed a new reason for our being <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>Every new achievement, whether it has been in arts or science, in war or in manufactures, has constituted for us a new bond and a new sentiment holding us together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>Why, then, I would ask, do we see these lengthened shadows which follow in the course of our political history?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>Is it because our sun is declining to the horizon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/>Are they the shadows of evening, or are they, as I hopefully believe, but the mists which are exhaled by the sun as it rises, but which are to be dispersed by its meridian glory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/>Are they but the little evanishing clouds that flit between the people and the great objects for which the <rs>Constitution</rs> was established?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/>I hopefully look toward the reaction which will establish the fact that our sun is still in the ascendant&mdash;that that cloud which has so long covered our political horizon is to be dispersed&mdash;that we are not again to be divided on parallels of latitude and about the domestic institutions of States&mdash;a sectional attack on the prosperity and tranquillity of a nation&mdash;but only by differences in opinion upon measures of expediency, upon questions of relative interest, by discussions as to <pb id="p.487" n="487"/> the powers of the <name>States</name> and the rights of the <name>States</name>, and the powers of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>&mdash;such discussion as is commemorated in this picture of your own great and glorious <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00487.01843" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, when he specially addressed our best, most tried, and greatest man, the pure and incorruptible <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00487.01844" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, represented as intently listening to catch the accents of eloquence that fell from his lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>Those giants strove each for his conviction, not against a section&mdash;not against each other; they stood to each other in the relation of personal affection and esteem, and never did I see <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0055.00487.01845" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> so agitated, never did I hear his voice falter, as when he delivered the eulogy on <persName n="Calhoun,,John,C.,," id="n0125.0055.00487.01846" reg="default:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>But allusion was made to my own connection with your great and favorite departed statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6130"/>Of that I will only say, on this occasion, that very early in my Congressional life <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0055.00487.01847" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Daniel,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> was arraigned for an offense which affected him most deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6131"/>He was no accountant, and all knew that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6132"/>He was arraigned on a pecuniary charge&mdash;the misapplication of what is known as the secret-service fund&mdash;and I was <num value="1">one</num> of the committee that had to investigate the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6133"/>I endeavored to do justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6134"/>I endeavored to examine the evidence with a view to ascertain the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6135"/>It is true I remembered that he was an eminent American statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6136"/>It is true that as an American I hoped he would come out without a stain upon his garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6137"/>But I entered upon the investigation to find the truth and to do justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6138"/>The result was, he was acquitted of every charge that was made against him, and it was equally my pride and my pleasure to vindicate him in every form which lay within my power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6139"/>No <num value="1">one</num> that knew <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName> could have believed that he would ever ask whether a charge was made against a Massachusetts man or a Mississippian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6140"/>No! It belonged to a lower, to a later, and I trust a shorter-lived race of statesmen, who measure all facts by considerations of latitude and longitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6141"/>I honor that sentiment which makes us oftentimes too confident, and to despise too much the danger of that agitation which disturbs the peace of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6142"/>I respect that feeling which regards the <rs>Union</rs> as too strong to be broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6143"/>But, at the same time, in sober judgment, it will not do to treat too lightly the danger which has existed and still exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6144"/>I have heard our <orgName n="Constitution and Union" type="newspaper">Constitution and Union</orgName> compared to the granite shores which face the sea, and, dashing back the foam of the waves, stand unmoved by their fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6145"/>Now I accept the simile: and I have stood upon the shore, and I have seen the waves of the sea dash upon the granite of your own shores which frowns over the ocean, have seen the spray thrown back from the cliffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6146"/>But, when the tide had ebbed, I saw that the rock was seamed and worn; and, when the tide was low, the pieces that had been riven from the granite rock were lying at its base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6147"/>And thus the waves of sectional agitation are dashing themselves against the granite patriotism of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6148"/>But even that must show the seams and scars of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6149"/>Sectional hostility will follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6150"/>The danger lies at your door, and it is time to arrest it. Too long have we allowed this influence to progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6151"/>It is time that men should go back to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> foundation of our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6152"/>They should drink the waters of the fountain at the source of our colonial and early history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>You, men of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, go to the street where the massacre occurred in <dateStruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6154"/>There you should learn how your fathers strove for community rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6155"/>And near the same spot you should learn how proudly the delegation of democracy came <pb id="p.488" n="488"/> to demand the removal of the troops from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and how the venerable <rs>Samuel Adams</rs> stood asserting the rights of democracy, dauntless as <persName n="Hampden,,,,," id="n0125.0055.00488.01848" reg="mostcommon:Hampden,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampden</surname></persName>, clear and eloquent as <persName><foreName>Sidney</foreName></persName>; and how they drove out the myrmidons who had trampled on the rights of the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6156"/>All over our country, these monuments, instructive to the present generation, of what our fathers did, are to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6157"/>In the library of your association for the collection of your early history, I found a letter descriptive of the reading of the church service to his army by <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0125.0055.00488.01849" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, during <num value="1">one</num> of those winters when the army was ill-clad and without shoes, when he built a little log-cabin for a meeting-house, and there, reading the service to them his sight failed him, he put on his glasses and, with emotion which manifested the reality of his feelings, said, <quote>I have grown gray in serving my country, and now I am growing blind.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6158"/></p> 
<p>By the aid of your records you may call before you the day when the delegation of the army of the democracy of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> demanded compliance with its requirements for the removal of the troops, A painfully thrilling case will be found in the heroic conduct of your father's friends, the patriots in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6159"/>The prisoners were put upon the hulks, where the small-pox existed, and where they were brought on shore to stay the progress of the infection, and were offered, if they would enlist in <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty's</name> service, release from all their sufferings, present and prospective; while, if they would not, the rations would be taken from their families, and they would be sent back to the hulks and again exposed to the infection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6160"/>Emaciated as they were, with the prospect of being returned to confinement, and their families turned out into the streets, the spirit of independence, the devotion to liberty, was so supreme in their breasts, that they gave <num value="1">one</num> loud huzza for <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0125.0055.00488.01850" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, and went to meet death in their loathsome prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6161"/>From these glorious recollections, from the emotions which they create, when the sacrifices of those who gave you the heritage of liberty are read in your early history, the eye is directed to our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6163"/>I do not envy the heart of that American whose pulse does not beat quicker, and who does not feel within him a high exultation and pride, in the past glory and future prospects of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6164"/>With these prospects are associated&mdash;if we are only wise, true, and faithful, if we shun sectional dissension&mdash;all that man can conceive of the progression of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6165"/>And the only danger which threatens those high prospects is that miserable spirit which, disregarding the obligations of honor, makes war upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>; which induces men to assume powers they do not possess, trampling as well upon the great principles which lie at the foundation of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, and the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs>, as upon the honorable obligations which were fixed upon them by their fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6177"/><hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs></hi>: Among the many blessings for which we are indebted to our ancestry is that of transmitting to us a written Constitution; a fixed standard to which, in the progress of events, every case may be referred, and by which it may be measured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6178"/>But for this, the wise men who formed our Government dared not have hoped for its perpetuity; for they saw, floating down the tide of time, wreck after wreck, marking the short life of every republic which had preceded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6179"/>With this, however, to check, to restrain, and to direct their posterity, they might reasonably hope the <rs>Government</rs> they founded should last for ever; that it should secure the great purposes for which it was ordained and established; that it would be the shield of their posterity equally in every part of the country, and equally in all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6180"/>It was this which mainly distinguished the formation of our Government from those confederacies or republics which had preceded it; and this is the best foundation for our hope to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6181"/>The resolutions which have been read, and which I had the honor to present to the <name>Senate</name>, are little more than the announcement of what I hold to be the clearly-expressed declarations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6182"/>To that fixed standard it is sought, at this time, when we are drifting far from the initial point, and when clouds and darkness hover over us, to bring back the <rs>Government</rs>, and to test our condition to-day by the rules which our fathers laid down for us in the beginning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6183"/>The differences which exist between different portions of the country, the rivalries and the jealousies of to-day, though differing in degree, are exactly of the nature of those which preceded the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6184"/>Our fathers were aware of the different interests of the navigating and planting States, as they were then regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6185"/>They sought to compose those difficulties, and, by compensating advantages given by <num value="1">one</num> to the other, to form a Government equal and just in its operation, and which, like the gentle showers of heaven, should fall twice blessed, blessing him that gives and him that receives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6186"/>This beneficial action and reaction between the different interests of the country constituted the bond of union and the motive of its formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6187"/>They constitute it to-day, if we are sufficiently wise to appreciate our interests, and sufficiently faithful to observe our trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6188"/>Indeed, with the extension of territory, with the multiplication of interests, with the varieties, increasing from time to time, of the products of this great country, the bonds which bind the <rs>Union</rs> together should have increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6189"/>Rationally considered, they have increased, because the free trade which was established in the beginning has now become more valuable to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than their trade with all the rest of the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6190"/>I do not propose to argue questions of natural rights and inherent powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6191"/>I plant my reliance upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that Constitution which you have all sworn to support; that Constitution which you have solemnly pledged yourself to maintain while you hold the seat you now occupy in the <name>Senate</name>; to which you are bound in its spirit and in its letter not grudgingly, but willingly, to render <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> your obedience and support as long as you hold office under the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6203"/>The Constitution is the law supreme to every American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6204"/>It is the plighted faith of our fathers; it is the hope of our posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6205"/>I say, then, I come not to argue questions outside of or above the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but to plead the cause of right, of law and order, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and to plead it to those who have sworn to abide by that obligation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6206"/><num value="1">One</num> of the fruitful sources, as I hold it, of the errors which prevail in our country, is the theory that this is a Government of <num value="1">one</num> people; that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was formed by a mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6207"/>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is a compact between the sovereign members who formed it; and, if there be <num value="1">one</num> feature common to all the colonies planted upon the shores of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, it is desire for community independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6208"/>It was for this the <rs>Puritan</rs>, the <name>Huguenot</name>, the <rs>Catholic</rs>, the <rs>Quaker</rs>, the <name>Protestant</name>, left the land of their nativity, and, guided by the shadows thrown by the fires of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> persecution, they sought and found the <rs>American</rs> refuge of civil and religious freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6209"/>While they existed as separate and distinct colonies they were not forebearing toward each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6210"/>They oppressed opposite religions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6211"/>They did not come here with the enlarged idea of no established religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6212"/>The Puritans drove out the <name>Quakers</name>; the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church-of-England</orgName> men drove out the <name>Catholics</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6213"/>Persecution reigned through the colonies, except, perhaps, that of the <rs>Catholic</rs> colony of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>; but the rule was&mdash;persecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6214"/>Therefore, I say the common idea, and the only common idea, was community independence&mdash;the right of each independent people to do as they pleased in their domestic affairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6215"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was made by the colonies, each for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6216"/>The recognition of their independence was not for the colonies united, but for each of the colonies which had maintained its independence; and so, when the <pb id="p.492" n="492"/> Constitution was formed, the delegates were not elected by the people <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, but they came from each <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name>; and when the <rs>Constitution</rs> was formed it was referred, not to the people <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, but to the <name>States</name> severally, and severally by them ratified and approved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6217"/>But, if there be anything which enforces this idea more than another, it is the unequal dates at which it received this approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6218"/>From <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, nearly <measure n="2.5years" type="date">two years and a half</measure> elapsed; and the <rs>Government</rs> went into operation something like a year&mdash;I believe more than a year&mdash;before the last ratification was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6219"/>Is it then contended that, by this ratification and adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, the <name>States</name> surrendered that sovereignty which they had previously gained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6220"/>Can it be that men who braved the perils of the ocean, the privations of the wilderness, who fought the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, in the hour of their success, when all was sunshine and peace around them, came voluntarily forward to lay down that community independence for which they had suffered so much and so long?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6221"/>Reason forbids it; but, if reason did not furnish a sufficient answer, the action of the <name>States</name> themselves forbids it. The great <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>&mdash;great, relatively, then, as she is now&mdash;manifested her wisdom in not receiving merely that implication which belongs to the occasion, which was accepted by the other States, but she required the positive assertion of that retention of her sovereignty and power over all her affairs as the condition on which she ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6230"/></p> 
<p>Here the use of the phrase <quote>State governments</quote> shows how utterly unwarrantable the construction has been, to say that the reference here was to the whole people of the <name>States</name>&mdash;to the people of all the <name>States</name>&mdash;and not to the people of each of the <name>States</name> severally.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6231"/>I spoke, however, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, but a moment ago, of the difference of politics, products, population, constituting the great motive for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6232"/>It was, indeed, its necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6233"/>Had all the people been alike&mdash;had their institutions all been the same&mdash;there would have been no interest to bring them together; there would have been no cause or necessity for any restraint being imposed upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6234"/>It was the fact that they differed which rendered it necessary to have some law governing their intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6235"/>It was the fact that their products were opposite&mdash;that their pursuits were various&mdash;that rendered it the great interest of the people that they should have free trade existing among each other; that free trade which <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0125.0056.00493.01857" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,Benjamin,,,:2"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> characterized as being between the <name>States</name> such as existed between the counties of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6236"/>Since that era, however, a fiber then unknown in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the production of which is dependent upon the domestic institution of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery, has come to be cultivated in such amounts, to enter so into the <rs n="wearing apparel" type="product">wearing apparel</rs> of the world, so greatly to add to the comfort of the poor, that it may be said to-day that that little fiber, cotton, wraps the commercial world and binds it to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in bonds to keep the peace with us which no Government dare break.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6237"/>It has built up the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6238"/>It is their great manufacturing interest to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6239"/>It supports their shipping abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6240"/>It enables them to purchase in the markets of <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>, when the high premium to be paid on the milled dollar would otherwise exclude them from that market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6241"/>These are a part of the blessings resulting from that increase and variety of product which could not have existed if we had all been alike; which would have been lost to-day unless free trade between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was still preserved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6242"/>And here it strikes me as somewhat strange that a book recently issued has received the commendation of a large number of the representatives of the manufacturing and commercial States, though, apart from its falsification of statistics and low abuse of Southern States, institutions, and interests, the great feature which stands prominently out from it is the arraignment of the <rs>South</rs> for using their surplus money in buying the manufactures of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6243"/>How a manufacturing and commercial people can be truly represented by those who would inculcate such doctrines as these, is to me passing strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6244"/>Is it vain boasting which renders you anxious to proclaim to the world that we buy our buckets, our rakes, and our shovels from you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6245"/>No, there is too much good sense in the people for that; and, therefore, I am left at a loss to understand the motive, unless it be that deep-rooted hate which makes you blind to your own interest when that interest is weighed in the balance with the denunciation and detraction of your brethren of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6246"/>The great principle which lay at the foundation of this fixed standard, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, was the equality of rights between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6247"/>This was essential; it was necessary; it was a step which had to be taken <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> before any progress could be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6248"/>It was the essential requisite of the very idea of sovereignty in the <rs>State</rs>; of a compact voluntarily entered into between sovereigns; and it is that equality of right under the <rs>Constitution</rs> on which we now insist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6249"/>But more: when the <name>States</name> united they transferred their forts, their armament, their ships, and their right to maintain armies and navies, to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6250"/>It was the disarmament of the <name>States</name>, under the operation of a league which made the warlike operations, the powers of defense, common to them all. Then, with this equality of the <name>States</name>, with this disarmament of the <name>States</name>, if there had been nothing in the <rs>Constitution</rs> to express it, I say the protection of every constitutional right would follow as a necessary incident, and could not be denied by any <num value="1">one</num> who could understand and would admit the true theory of such a Government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6251"/>We claim protection, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because it is our right; secondly, because it is the duty of the <rs>General Government</rs>; and, thirdly, because we have entered into a compact together, which deprives each State of the power of using all the means which it might employ for its own defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6252"/>This is the general theory of the right of protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6253"/>What is the exception to it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6254"/>Is there an exception?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6255"/>If so, who made it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6256"/>Does the <rs>Constitution</rs> discriminate between different kinds of property?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6257"/>Did the <rs>Constitution</rs> attempt to assimilate the institutions of the different States confederated together?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6258"/>Was there a single State in this Union that would have been so unfaithful to the principles which had prompted them in their colonial position, and which had prompted them, at a still earlier period, to seek and try the temptations of the wilderness; is there <num value="1">one</num> which would have consented to allow the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to control or to discriminate between her institutions and those of her <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">confederate States</placeName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6259"/>But, if it be contended that this is argument, and that you need authority, I will draw it from the fountain; from the spring before it had been polluted; from the debates in the formation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; from the views of those who at least it will be admitted understood what they were doing.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6330"/>With the disappearance of that party&mdash;and perhaps for the very reasons that caused its disappearance&mdash;up rose radical organizations who strode so far beyond progressive Democracy that Democracy took the place now left vacant by the old <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName>, and became the reservoir into which all conservatism was poured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6340"/>I consider it as the mere agent of the <name>States</name>&mdash;an agent of limited power; and that it can do nothing save that which the <rs>Constitution</rs> empowers it to perform; and that, though the treaty or the deed of cession may direct or control, it can not enlarge or expand the powers of the <rs>Congress</rs>; that it is not sovereign in any essential particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6352"/>The Congress has power to defend the territory, to repel invasions, to suppress insurrection; the <rs>Congress</rs> has power to see the laws executed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6417"/>The phraseology which has been employed on this question seems to me to betray a strange confusion of ideas&mdash;to speak of a sovereignty, a plenary legislative power deriving its power from an agent; a sovereignty held subject to articles with the formation of which that sovereignty had nothing to do; a compact to which it was not a party!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6418"/>You say to a sovereign: <quote>A and B have agreed on certain terms between themselves, and you must govern your conduct according to them; yet I do not deny your sovereignty!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6419"/>That is, the power to do as they please, provided it conforms to the rule which others chose to lay down!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6420"/>Can this be a definition of sovereignty?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6421"/>But again, sir, nothing seems to me more illogical than the argument that this power is acquired by a grant from the <rs>Congress</rs>, connected with the other argument that Congress have not got the power to do the act themselves; that is to say, that the recipient takes more than the giver possessed; that a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> can do anything which a <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName> can do, and that <quote>subject to the <rs>Constitution</rs></quote> means merely the restraints imposed upon both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6422"/>This is confounding the whole theory and the history of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6423"/>The States were the grantors; they made the compact; they gave the <rs>Federal</rs> agent its powers; they inhibited themselves from doing certain things, and all else they retained to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6424"/>This Federal agent got just so much as the <name>States</name> chose to give&mdash;no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6425"/>It could do nothing save by warrant of the authority of the grant made by the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>Therefore its powers are not comparable to the powers of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName>, because <num value="1">one</num> is the creature of grant, and the other the exponent of sovereign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6427"/>The <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> have covered the whole ground of the relation of the <rs>Congress</rs> to the <rs>Territorial Legislatures</rs>&mdash;the agent of the <name>States</name> and the agent of the <rs>Congress</rs>&mdash;and the restrictions put upon the <num value="1">one</num> are those put upon the other, in language so clear as to render it needless further to labor the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6428"/>In <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, following the promulgation of this notion of squatter sovereignty, we had the idea of non-intervention introduced into the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, and it is strange to me how that idea has expanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/>It seems to have been more malleable than gold; to have been hammered out to an extent that covers boundless regions undiscovered by those who proclaimed the doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/>Nonintervention then meant, as the debates show, that Congress should neither prohibit nor establish slavery in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/>That I hold to now. Will any <num value="1">one</num> suppose that Congress then meant by non-intervention that Congress should legislate in no regard in respect to property in slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>Why, sir, the very acts which they passed at the time refute it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6433"/>Congress acted then upon the subject &mdash;acted beyond the limit of its authority, as I believed, confidently believed; and, if ever that act comes before the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, I feel satisfied they will declare it null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/>Are we to understand that those men, thus acting at the very moment, intended by non-intervention to deny and repudiate the laws they were then creating?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6452"/>By what species of legerdemain this doctrine of non-intervention has come to extend to a paralysis of the <rs>Government</rs> on the whole subject, to exclude the <rs>Congress</rs> from any kind of legislation whatever, I am at a loss to conceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6453"/>Certain it is, it was not the theory of that period, and it was not contended for in all <pb id="p.505" n="505"/> the controversies we had then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6454"/>I had no faith in it then; I considered it an evasion; I held that the duty of Congress ought to be performed; that the issue was before us, and ought to be met, the sooner the better; that truth would prevail if presented to the people; borne down to-day, it would rise up to-morrow; and I stood then on the same general plea which I am making now. The <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> [<persName n="Douglas,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0056.00505.01891" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>] and myself differed at that time, as I presume we do now. We differed radically then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6455"/>He opposed every proposition which I made, voting against propositions to give power to a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to protect slave-property which should be taken there; to remove the obstructions of the <rs>Mexican</rs> laws; voting for a proposition to exclude the conclusion that slavery might be taken there; voting for the proposition expressly to prohibit its introduction; voting for the proposition to keep in force the laws of <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 4" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName> which prohibit it. Some of these votes, it is but just to him I should say, I think he gave perforce of his instructions; but others of them, I think it is equally fair to suppose, were outside of the limits of any instructions which could have been given before the fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6456"/>In <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, advancing in this same general line of thought, the <rs>Congress</rs>, in enacting territorial bills, left out a provision which had before been usually contained in them, requiring the <name>Legislature</name> of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> to submit its laws to the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6457"/>It has been sometimes assumed that this was the recognition of the power of the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> to exercise plenary legislation, as might that of a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6458"/>It will be remembered that, when our present form of government was instituted, there were those who believed the <rs>Federal Government</rs> should have the power of revision over the laws of a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6459"/>It was long and ably contended for in the <rs>Convention</rs> which formed the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and <num value="1">one</num> of the compromises which was made was an appellate power&mdash;to lodge power in the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> to decide all questions of constitutional law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6460"/>But did this omission of the obligation to send here the laws of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> work this grant of power to the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6461"/>Certainly not; it could not; and that it did not is evinced by the fact that, at a subsequent period, the organic act was revised because the legislation of the <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Territory of Kansas</placeName> was offensive to the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6462"/>Congress could not abdicate its authority; it could not abandon its trust; and, when it omitted the requirement that the laws should be sent back, it created a <hi rend="italics">casus</hi> which required it to act without the official records being laid before it, as they would have been if the obligation had existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6463"/>That was all the difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6464"/>It was not enforcing upon the agent the obligation to send the information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6465"/>It left Congress, as to its power, just where it was. I find myself physically unable to go as fully into the subject as I intended, and therefore, omitting a reference to those acts, suffice it to say that here was the recognition of the obligation of Congress to interpose against a <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> for the protection of personal right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6466"/>That is what we ask of Congress now. I am not disposed to ask this Congress to go into speculative legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6467"/>I am not <num value="1">one</num> of those who would willingly see this Congress enact a code to be applied to all Territories and for all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6468"/>I only ask that cases, as they arise, may be met according to the exigency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6469"/>I ask that when personal and property rights in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> are not protected, then the <rs>Congress</rs>, by existing laws and governmental machinery, shall intervene and provide such means as will secure in each case, as far as may be, an adequate remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6470"/><pb id="p.506" n="506"/> I ask no slave code, nor horse code, nor machine code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6471"/>I ask that the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> be made to understand beforehand that the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> does not concede to them the power to interfere with the rights of person or property guaranteed by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and that it will apply the remedy; if the <orgName n="Territorial Legislature" type="legislature">Territorial Legislature</orgName> should so far forget its duty, so far transcend its power, as to commit that violation of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6472"/>That is the announcement of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> resolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6473"/>These are the general views which I entertain of our right of protection and the duty of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6474"/>They are those which are entertained by the constituency I have the honor to represent, whose delegation has recently announced those principles at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6475"/>I honor them, and I approve their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6476"/>I think their bearing was worthy of the mother-State which sent them there; and I doubt not she will receive them with joy and gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6477"/>They have asserted and vindicated her equality of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6478"/>By that asserted equality of right I doubt not she will stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6479"/>For weal or for woe, for prosperity or adversity, for the preservation of the great blessings which we enjoy, or the trial of a new and separate condition, I trust <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> never will surrender the smallest atom of the sovereignty, independence, and equality, to which she was born, to avoid any danger or any sacrifice to which she may hereby be exposed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6480"/>The <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> resolution of the series declares at what time a State may form a Constitution and decide upon her domestic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6481"/>I deny this right to the territorial condition, because the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> belongs in common to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6482"/>Every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as a joint owner of that Territory, has a right to go into it with any property which he may possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6483"/>These territorial inhabitants require municipal law, police, and government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6484"/>They should have them, but they should be restricted to their own necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6485"/>They have no right within their municipal power to attempt to decide the rights of the people of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6486"/>They have no right to exclude any citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from owning and equally enjoying this common possession; it is for the purpose of preserving order, and giving protection to rights of person and property, that a municipal territorial government should be instituted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6487"/>The last resolution refers to a law founded on a provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which contains an obligation of faith to every State of the <rs>Union</rs>; and that obligation of faith has been violated by <num value="13">thirteen</num> States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>&mdash;as many as originally fought the battles of the <name>Revolution</name> and established the <name>Confederation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6488"/>Is it to be expected that a compact thus broken in part, violated in its important features, will be regarded as binding in all else?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6489"/>Is the free trade which the <rs>North</rs> sought in the formation of the <rs>Union</rs>, and for which the <name>States</name> generally agreed to give Congress the power to regulate commerce, to be trampled under foot by laws of obstruction, not giving to the citizens of the <rs>South</rs> that free transit across the territory of the <rs>Northern States</rs> which we might claim from any friendly state under Christendom; and is Congress to stand powerless by, on the doctrine of non-intervention?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6490"/>We have a right to claim abstinence from interference with our rights from any Government on the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6491"/>Shall we claim no more from that which we have constituted for our own purposes, and which we support by draining our own means for its support?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6492"/>We have had agitation, changing in its form, and gathering intensity, for the last <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>. It was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for political power, and directed against new States; <pb id="p.507" n="507"/> now it has assumed a social form, is all-prevailing, and has reached the point of revolution and civil war. For it was only last fall that an overt act was committed by men who were sustained by arms and money, raised by extensive combination among the non-slaveholding States, to carry treasonable war against the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, because now, as before the <name>Revolution</name>, and ever since, she held the <name>African</name> in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6493"/>This is part of the history and marks the necessity of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6494"/>It warns us to stop and reflect, to go back to the original standard, to measure our acts by the obligation of our fathers, by the pledges they made <num value="1">one</num> to the other, to see whether we are conforming to our plighted faith, and to ask seriously, solemnly, looking each other inquiringly in the face, what we should do to save our country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6495"/>This agitation being at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> of sectional pride for political power, has at last degenerated or grown up to (as you please) a trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6496"/>There are men who habitually set aside a portion of money which they are annually to apply to what are called <quote>charitable purposes</quote>&mdash;that is to say, so far as I understand it, to support some vagrant lecturer, whose purpose is agitation and mischief wherever he goes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6497"/>This constitutes, therefore, a trade; a class of people are thus employed &mdash;employed for mischief, for incendiary purposes, perhaps not always understood by those who furnish the money; but such is the effect; such is the result of their action; and in this state of the case I call upon the <name>Senate</name> to affirm the great principles on which our institutions rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6498"/>In no spirit of crimination have I stated the reasons why I present it. For these reasons I call upon them now to restrain the growth of evil passion, and to bring back the public sense as far as in them lies, by earnest and united effort, if it may be, to crown our country with peace, and start it once more in its primal channel on a career of progressive prosperity and justice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6499"/>The majority section can not be struggling for additional power in order to preserve their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6500"/>If any of them ever believed in what is called Southern aggression, they know now they have the majority in the representative districts and in the <orgName n="Electoral College" type="college">electoral college</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6501"/>They can not, therefore, fear an invasion of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6502"/>They need no additional political power to protect them from that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6503"/>The argument, then, or the reason on which this agitation commenced, has passed away; and yet we are asked, if a party hostile to our institutions shall gain possession of the <rs>Government</rs>, that we shall stand quietly by, and wait for an overt act. Overt act!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6504"/>Is not a declaration of war an overt act?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6505"/>What would be thought of a country that, after a declaration of war, and while the enemy's fleets were upon the sea, should wait until a city had been sacked before it would say that war existed, or resistance should be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6506"/>The power of resistance consists, in no small degree, in meeting the evil at the outer gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6507"/>I can speak for myself&mdash;and I have no right to speak for others&mdash;when I say that, if I belonged to a party organized on the basis of making war on any section or interest in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, if I know myself, I would instantly quit it. We have made no war against you. We have asked no discrimination in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6508"/>We claim to have but the <rs>Constitution</rs> fairly and equally administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6509"/>To consent to less than this would be to sink in the scale of manhood; would be to make our posterity so degraded that they would curse this generation for robbing them of the rights their Revolutionary fathers bequeathed them. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6510"/>Among the great purposes declared in the preamble of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.508" n="508"/> to provide for the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6511"/>Provision for the general welfare implies general fraternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6512"/>This Union was not expected to be held together by coercion; the power of force as a means was denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6513"/>They sought, however, to bind it perpetually together with that which was stronger than triple bars of brass and steel&mdash;the ceaseless current of kind offices, renewing and renewed in an eternal flow, and gathering volume and velocity as it rolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6514"/>It was a function intended not for the injury of any. It declared its purpose to be the benefit of all. Concessions which were made between the different States in the <rs>Convention</rs> prove the motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6515"/>Each gave to the other what was necessary to it; what each could afford to spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6516"/>Young as a nation, our triumphs under this system have had no parallel in human history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6517"/>We have tamed a wilderness; we have spanned a continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6518"/>We have built up a granary that secures the commercial world against the fear of famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6519"/>Higher than all this, we have achieved a moral triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6520"/>We have received, by hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, a constant tide of immigrants&mdash;energetic, if not well educated, fleeing, some from want, some from oppression, some from the penalties of violated law&mdash;received them into our society; and by the gentle suasion of a Government which exhibits no force, by removing want and giving employment, they have subsided into peaceful citizens, and have increased the wealth and power of our country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6521"/>If, then, this temple so blessed, and to the roof of which we were about to look to see it extended over the continent, giving a protecting arm to infant republics that need it&mdash;if this temple is tottering on its pillars, what, I ask, can be a higher or nobler duty for the <name>Senate</name> to perform than to rush to its pillars and uphold them, or be crushed in the attempt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6522"/>We have tampered with a question which has grown in magnitude by each year's delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6523"/>It requires to be plainly met&mdash;the truth to be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6524"/>The patriotism and the sound sense of the people, whenever the <rs>Federal Government</rs> from its high places of authority shall proclaim the truth in unequivocal language, will, in my firm belief, receive and approve it. But so long as we deal, like the <name>Delphic</name> oracle, in words of double meaning, so long as we attempt to escape from responsibility, and exhibit our fear to declare the truth by the fact that we do not act upon it, we must expect speculative theory to occupy the mind of the public, and error to increase as time rolls on. But, if the sad fate should be ours, for this most minute cause, to destroy our Government, the historian who shall attempt philosophically to examine the question will, after he has put on his microscopic glasses and discovered it, be compelled to cry out, <quote>Veritably so the unseen insect in the course of time destroys the mighty oak!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6525"/>Now, I believe&mdash;may I not say I believe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6526"/>if not, then I hope&mdash;there is yet time, by the full, explicit declaration of the truth, to disabuse the popular mind, to arouse the popular heart, to expose the danger from lurking treason and ill-concealed hostility; to rally a virtuous people to their country's rescue, who, circling closer and deeper as the storm gathers fury, around the ark of their fathers' covenant, will place it in security, there happily to remain a sign of fraternity, justice, and equality, to our remotest posterity.</p></quote> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6529"/>Sir: We have the honor to transmit to you a copy of the full powers from the <rs>Convention</rs> of the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, under which we are <quote>authorized and empowered to treat with the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the delivery of the forts, magazines, lighthouses, and other <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, with their appurtenances, within the limits of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and also for an apportionment of the public debt, and for a division of all other property held by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as agent of the confederated States of which <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was recently a member; and generally to negotiate as to all other measures and arrangements proper to be made and adopted in the existing relation of the parties, and for the continuance of peace and amity between this Commonwealth and the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6530"/></p> 
<p>In the execution of this trust, it is our duty to furnish you, as we now do, with an official copy of the ordinance of secession, by which the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> has resumed the powers she delegated to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and has declared her perfect sovereignty and independence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6531"/>It would also have been our duty to have informed you that we were ready to negotiate with you upon all such questions as are necessarily raised by the adoption of this ordinance, and that we were prepared to enter upon this negotiation with the earnest desire to avoid all unnecessary and hostile collision, and so to inaugurate our new relations as to secure mutual respect, general advantage, and a future of good &mdash; will and harmony beneficial to all the parties concerned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6532"/>But the events of the last <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> render such an assurance impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6533"/>We came here the representatives of an authority which could, at any time within the past <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, have taken possession of the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName>, but which, upon pledges given in a manner that, we can not doubt, determined to trust to your honor rather than to its own power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6534"/>Since our arrival here an officer of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, acting, as we are assured, not only without but against your orders, has dismantled <num value="1">one</num> fort and occupied another, thus altering, to a most important extent, the condition of affairs under which we came.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6535"/>Until these circumstances are explained in a manner which relieves us of all doubt as to the spirit in which these negotiations shall be conducted, we are forced to suspend all discussion as to any arrangements by which our mutual interests might be amicably adjusted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6540"/><hi rend="italics">Gentlemen</hi>: I have the honor to receive your communication of <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="28">28th inst.</day></dateStruct>, together with a copy of your <quote>full powers from the <rs>Convention</rs> of the <name>People</name> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>,</quote> authorizing you to treat with the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> on various important subjects therein mentioned, and also a copy of the ordinance bearing date on the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">20th inst.</day></dateStruct>, declaring that <quote>the union now subsisting between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and other States, under the name of <q direct="unspecified">The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>,</q> is hereby dissolved.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6541"/></p> 
<p>In answer to this communication, I have to say that my position as <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was clearly defined in the message to Congress of the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6542"/>In that I stated that, <quote>apart from the execution of the laws, so far as this may be practicable, the <rs>Executive</rs> has no authority to decide what shall be the relations between the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6543"/>He has been invested with no such discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6544"/>He possesses no power to change the relations heretofore existing between them, much less to acknowledge the independence of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6545"/>This would be to invest a mere executive officer with the power of recognizing the dissolution of the confederacy among our <num value="33">thirty-three</num> sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6546"/>It bears no resemblance to the recognition of a foreign <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> government&mdash;involving no such responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6547"/>Any attempt to do this would, on his part, be a naked act of usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6548"/>It is, therefore, my duty to submit to Congress the whole question, in all its bearings.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6549"/></p> 
<p>Such is my opinion still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6550"/>I could, therefore, meet you only as private gentlemen of the highest character, and was entirely willing to communicate to Congress any proposition you might have to make to that body upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6551"/>Of this you were well aware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6552"/>It was my earnest desire that such a disposition might be made of the whole subject by Congress, who alone possess the power, as to prevent the inauguration of a civil war between the parties in regard to the possession of the <rs>Federal</rs> forts in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>; and I therefore deeply regret that, in your opinion, <quote>the events of the last <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> render this impossible.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6553"/>In conclusion, you urge upon me <quote>the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>,</quote> stating that, <quote>under present circumstances, they are a standing menace, which renders negotiation impossible, and, as our present experience shows, threatens speedily to bring to a bloody issue questions which ought to be settled with temperance and judgment.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6554"/></p> 
<p>The reason for this change in your position is that, since your arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, <quote>an officer of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, acting as we (you) are assured, not only without your (my) orders, has dismantled <num value="1">one</num> fort and occupied another, thus altering, to a most important extent, the condition of affairs under which we <pb id="p.511" n="511"/> (you) came.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6555"/>You also allege that you came here <quote>the representatives of an authority which could at any time within the past <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> have taken possession of the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName>, but which, upon pledges given in a manner that we (you) can not doubt, determined to trust to your (my) honor rather than to its own power.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6556"/></p> 
<p>This brings me to a consideration of the nature of those alleged pledges, and in what manner they have been observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6557"/>In my message of the <dateStruct value="-12-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last, I stated, in regard to the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, that it <quote>has been purchased for a fair equivalent <q direct="unspecified">by the consent of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName>, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,</q> etc., and over these the authority <q direct="unspecified">to exercise exclusive legislation</q> has been expressly granted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6558"/>It is not believed that any attempt will be made to expel the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from this property by force; but, if in this I should prove to be mistaken, the officer in command of the forts has received orders to act strictly on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6559"/>In such a contingency, the responsibility for consequences would rightfully rest upon the heads of the assailants.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6560"/>This being the condition of the parties on <dateStruct value="-12-8"><day type="name">Saturday</day>, <day reg="8">8th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, <num value="4">four</num> of the representatives from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> called upon me and requested an interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6561"/>We had an earnest conversation on the subject of these forts, and the best means of preventing a collision between the parties, for the purpose of sparing the effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6562"/>I suggested, for prudential reasons, that it would be best to put in writing what they said to me verbally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6563"/>They did so accordingly, and on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th instant</day></dateStruct>, <num value="3">three</num> of them presented to me a paper signed by all the representatives from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, with a single exception, of which the following is a copy:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6565"/>In compliance with our statement to you yesterday, we now express to you our strong convictions that neither the constituted authorities, nor any body of the people of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, will either attack or molest the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> forts in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, previously to the action of the <rs>Convention</rs>, and, we hope and believe, not until an offer has been made, through an accredited representative, to negotiate for an amicable arrangement of all matters between the <rs>State</rs> and Federal Government, provided that no reenforcements shall be sent into those forts, and their relative military <hi rend="italics">status</hi> shall remain as at present.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6567"/>And here I must, in justice to myself, remark that, at the time the paper was presented to me, I objected to the word <quote>provided,</quote> as it might be construed into an agreement, on my part, which I never would make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6568"/>They said that nothing was further from their intention; they did not so understand it, and I should not so consider it. It is evident they could enter into no reciprocal agreement with me on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6569"/>They did not profess to have authority to do this, and were <pb id="p.512" n="512"/> acting in their individual character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6570"/>I considered it as nothing more, in effect, than the promise of highly honorable gentlemen to exert their influence for the purpose expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6571"/>The event has proved that they have faithfully kept this promise, although I have never since received a line from any <num value="1">one</num> of them, or from any member of the <rs>Convention</rs> on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6572"/>It is well known that it was my determination, and this I freely expressed, not to reenforce the forts in the harbor, and thus produce a collision, until they had been actually attacked, or until I had certain evidence that they were about to be attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6573"/>This paper I received most cordially, and considered it as a happy omen that peace might still be preserved, and that time might thus be gained for reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6574"/>This is the whole foundation for the alleged pledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6575"/>But I acted in the same manner I would have done had I entered into a positive and formal agreement with parties capable of contracting, although such an agreement would have been, on my part, from the nature of my official duties, impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6576"/>The world knows that I have never sent any reenforcements to the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName>, and I have certainly never authorized any change to be made <quote>in their relative military <hi rend="italics">status</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6577"/></p> 
<p>Bearing upon this subject, I refer you to an order issued by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th instant</day></dateStruct>, to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00512.01902" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, but not brought to my notice until the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6578"/>It is as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6579"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6580"/>You are aware of the great anxiety of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> that a collision of the troops with the people of this State shall be avoided, and of his studied determination to pursue a course, with reference to the military force and forts in this harbor, which shall guard against such a collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6581"/>He has, therefore, carefully abstained from increasing the force at this point, or taking any measures which might add to the present excited state of the public mind, or which would throw any doubt on the confidence he feels that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> will not attempt by violence to obtain possession of the <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName>, or to interfere with their occupancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6582"/>But, as the counsel of rash and impulsive persons may possibly disappoint these expectations of the <rs>Government</rs>, he deems it proper that you should be prepared with instructions to meet so unhappy a contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6583"/>He has, therefore, directed me, verbally, to give you such instructions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6584"/>You are carefully to avoid every act which would needlessly tend to provoke aggression; and, for that reason, you are not, without evident and imminent necessity, to take up any position which could be construed into the assumption of a hostile attitude; but you are to hold possession of the forts in this harbor, and, if attacked, you are to defend yourself to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6585"/>The smallness of your force will not permit you, perhaps, to occupy more than <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> forts; but an attack on or attempt to take possession of either of them will be regarded as an act of hostility, and you may then put your command into either of them which you may deem most proper, to increase its power of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6586"/>You are also authorized to take similar defensive steps whenever you have tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Butler,,D.,P.,," id="n0125.0057.00512.01904" reg="default:Butler,D.,P.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName>  <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant Adjutant-General</rs>.</signed> <pb id="p.513" n="513"/> <dateline><placeName reg="Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2335409">Fort Moultrie, South Carolina</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1860-12-11"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="11">11</day>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.</dateline></closer> </body><back>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6589"/>Under these circumstances it is clear that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00513.01908" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> acted upon his own responsibility, and without authority, unless, indeed, he had <quote>tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act</quote> on the part of the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, which has not yet been alleged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6590"/>Still he is a brave and honorable officer, and justice requires that he should not be condemned without a fair hearing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6591"/>Be this as it may, when I learned that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00513.01909" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> had left <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, and proceeded to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> promptings were to command him to return to his former position, and there to await the contingencies presented in his instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6592"/>This could only have been done, with any degree of safety to the command, by the concurrence of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6593"/>But, before any steps could possibly have been taken in this direction, we received information, dated on the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="28">28th instant</day></dateStruct>, that <quote>the <rs>Palmetto</rs> flag floated out to the breeze at <placeName reg="Castle Pinckney">Castle Pinckney</placeName>, and a large military force went over last night (the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num>) to <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6594"/>Thus the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, without waiting or asking for any explanation, and doubtless believing, as you have expressed it, that the officer had acted not only without, but against my orders, on the very next day after the night when the removal was made, seized, by a military force, <num value="2">two</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> Federal forts in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and have covered them under their own flag, instead of that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6595"/>At this gloomy period of our history, startling events succeed each other rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6596"/>On the very day (the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="27">27th instant</day></dateStruct>) that possession of these <num value="2">two</num> forts was taken, the <rs>Palmetto</rs> flag was raised over the <rs type="place">Federal Custom-House</rs> and <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-Office</orgName> in <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>; and on the same day every officer of the customs&mdash;collector, naval officers, <rs type="role" n="Surveyor">surveyors</rs>, and appraisers&mdash;resigned their offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6597"/>And this, although it was well known, from the language of my message, that as an executive officer I felt myself bound to collect the revenue at the port of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> under the existing laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6598"/>In the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> we now find <num value="3">three</num> forts confronting each other, over all of which the <rs>Federal</rs> flag floated only <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> ago; but now over <num value="2">two</num> of them this flag has been supplanted, and the <rs>Palmetto</rs> flag has been substituted in its stead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6599"/>It is under all these circumstances that I am urged immediately to withdraw the troops from the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and am informed that, without this, negotiation is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6600"/>This I can not do; this I will not do. Such an idea was never thought of by me in any possible contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6601"/>No allusion to it had ever been made in any communication between myself and any human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6602"/>But the inference is, that I am bound to withdraw the troops from the only fort remaining in the possession of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, because the officer then in command of all the forts thought proper, without instructions, to change his position from <num value="1">one</num> of them to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6603"/>I can not admit the justice of any such inference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6604"/>At this point of writing I have received information, by telegram, from <persName n="Humphreys,Captain,,,," id="n0125.0057.00513.01910" reg="mostcommon:Humphreys,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>, in command of the arsenal at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, that <quote>it has to-day <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> (<dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num>) been taken by force of arms.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6605"/>It is estimated that the munitions of war belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in this arsenal are worth half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6606"/>Comment is needless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6607"/>After this information, I have only to add that, while it is my duty to defend <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, as a portion of the public property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, against hostile attacks from whatever quarter they may come, by such means as I may possess for this purpose, I do not perceive how such a defense can be construed into a menace against the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6611"/>Sir: We have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the <dateStruct value="-12-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, in reply to a note addressed by us to you on the <num value="28" type="ordinal">28th</num> of the same month, as commissioners from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6612"/>In reference to the declaration with which your reply commences, that <quote>your position as <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was clearly defined in the message to Congress of the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d instant</day></dateStruct>,</quote> that you possess <quote>no power to change the relations heretofore existing</quote> between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <quote>much less to acknowledge the independence of that State</quote>; and that, consequently, you could meet us only as private gentlemen of the highest character, with an entire willingness to communicate to Congress any proposition we might have to make, we deem it only necessary to say that, the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> having, in the exercise of that great right of self-government which underlies all our political organizations, declared herself sovereign and independent, we, as her representatives, felt no special solicitude as to the character in which you might recognize us. Satisfied that the <rs>State</rs> had simply exercised her unquestionable right, we were prepared, in order to reach substantial good, to waive formal considerations which your constitutional scruples might have prevented you from extending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6613"/>We came here, therefore, expecting to be received as you did receive us, and perfectly content with that entire willingness of which you assured us, to submit any proposition to Congress which we might have to make upon the subject of independence of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6614"/>The willingness was ample recognition of the condition of public affairs which rendered our presence necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6615"/>In this position, however, it is our duty, both to the <rs>State</rs> which we represent and to ourselves, to correct several important misconceptions of our letter into which you have fallen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6616"/>You say, <quote>It was my earnest desire that such a disposition might be made of the whole subject by Congress, who alone possesses the power to prevent the inauguration of a civil war between the parties in regard to the possession of the <rs>Federal</rs> forts in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>; and I, therefore, deeply regret that, in your opinion, <q direct="unspecified">the events of the last <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> render this impossible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6617"/></quote> We expressed no such opinion, and the language which you quote as ours is altered in its sense by the omission of a most important part of the sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6618"/><pb id="p.515" n="515"/> What we did say was, <quote>But the events of the last <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> render <hi rend="italics">such an assurance</hi> impossible.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6619"/>Place that <quote>assurance,</quote> as contained in our letter, in the sentence, and we are prepared to repeat it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6620"/>Again, professing to quote our language, you say: <quote>Thus the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, without waiting or asking for any explanation, and doubtless believing, as you have expressed it, that the officer had acted not only without, but against my orders,</quote> etc. We expressed no such opinion in reference to the belief of the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6621"/>The language which you have quoted was applied solely and entirely to <hi rend="italics">our assurance</hi>, obtained here, and based, as you well know, upon your own declaration&mdash;a declaration which, at that time, it was impossible for the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to have known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6622"/>But without following this letter into all its details, we propose only to meet the chief points of the argument.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6623"/>Some weeks ago, the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> declared her intention, in the existing condition of public affairs, to secede from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6624"/>She called a convention of her people to put her declarations in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6625"/>The Convention met and passed the ordinance of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6626"/>All this you anticipated, and your course of action was thoroughly considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6627"/>In your annual message you declared that you had no right, and would not attempt, to coerce a seceding State, but that you were bound by your constitutional oath, and would defend the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within the borders of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, if an attempt was made to take it by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6628"/>Seeing very early that this question of property was a difficult and delicate <num value="1">one</num>, you manifested a desire to settle it without collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6629"/>You did not reenforce the garrisons in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6630"/>You removed a distinguished and veteran officer from the command of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, because he attempted to increase his supply of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6631"/>You refused to send additional troops to the same garrison when applied for by the officer appointed to succeed him. You accepted the resignation of the oldest and most eminent member of your Cabinet, rather than allow these garrisons to be strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6632"/>You compelled an officer stationed at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> to return immediately to the arsenal <num value="40">forty</num> muskets which he had taken to arm his men. You expressed, not to <num value="1">one</num>, but to many, of the most distinguished of our public characters, whose testimony will be placed upon the record whenever it is necessary, your anxiety for a peaceful termination of this controversy, and your willingness not to disturb the military <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of the forts, if commissioners should be sent to the <rs>Government</rs>, whose communications you promised to submit to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6633"/>You received and acted on assurances from the highest official authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, that no attempt would be made to disturb your possession of the forts and property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, if you would not disturb their existing condition until commissioners had been sent, and the attempt to negotiate had failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6634"/>You took from the members of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> a written memorandum that no such attempt should be made, <quote>provided that no reenforcements shall be sent into those forts, and their relative military <hi rend="italics">status</hi> shall remain as at present.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6635"/>And, although you attach no force to the acceptance of such a paper, although you <quote>considered it as nothing more in effect than the promise of highly honorable gentlemen,</quote> as an obligation on <num value="1">one</num> side without corresponding obligation on the other, it must be remembered (if we are rightly informed) that you were pledged, if you ever did send reenforcements, to return it to those from whom you had received it before <pb id="p.516" n="516"/> you executed your resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6636"/>You sent orders to your officers, commanding them strictly to follow a line of conduct in conformity with such an understanding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6637"/>Besides all this, you had received formal and official notice, from the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, that we had been appointed commissioners and were on our way to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6638"/>You knew the implied condition under which we came; our arrival was notified to you, and an hour appointed for an interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6639"/>We arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, and you appointed an interview with us at <num value="1">one</num> the next day. Early on that day, <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, the news was received here of the movement of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00516.01915" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6640"/>That news was communicated to you immediately, and you postponed our meeting until <time value="2:30oclock">half-past 2 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, in order that you might consult your Cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6641"/>On Friday we saw you, and we called upon you then to redeem your pledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6642"/>You could not deny it. With the facts we have stated, and in the face of the crowning and conclusive fact that your <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had resigned his seat in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, upon the publicly avowed ground that the action of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00516.01916" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> had violated the pledged faith of the <rs>Government</rs>, and that unless the pledge was instantly redeemed he was dishonored, denial was impossible; you did not deny it. You do not deny it now, but you seek to escape from its obligations on <num value="2">two</num> grounds: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6643"/>That <hi rend="italics">we</hi> terminated all negotiation by demanding, as a preliminary, the withdrawal of the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> from the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>; and, <num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6644"/>That the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, instead of asking explanation and giving you the opportunity to vindicate yourself, took possession of other property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6645"/>We will examine both.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6646"/>In the first place, we deny positively that we have ever, in any way, made any such demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6647"/>Our letter is in your possession; it will stand by this on the record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6648"/>In it we inform you of the objects of our mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6649"/>We say that it would have been our duty to assure you of our readiness to commence negotiations with the most earnest and anxious desire to settle all questions between us amicably, and to our mutual advantage, but that events had rendered that assurance impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6650"/>We stated the events, and we said that, until some satisfactory explanation of these events was given us, we could not proceed; and then, having made this request for explanation, we added: <quote>And, in conclusion, we would urge upon you the immediate withdrawal of the troops from the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6651"/>Under present circumstances they are a standing menace, which renders negotiation impossible,</quote> etc. <quote>Under present circumstances</quote>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6652"/>What circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6653"/>Why, clearly the occupation of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and the dismantling of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> by <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00516.01917" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, in the face of your pledges, and without explanation or practical disavowal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6654"/>And there is nothing in the letter which would or could have prevented you from declining to withdraw the troops, and offering the restoration of <hi rend="italics">the status</hi> to which you were pledged, if such had been your desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6655"/>It would have been wiser and better, in our opinion, to have withdrawn the troops, and this opinion we urged upon you, but we <hi rend="italics">demanded</hi> nothing but such an explanation of the events of the last <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> as would restore our confidence in the spirit with which the negotiation should be conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6656"/>In relation to this withdrawal of the troops from the harbor, we are compelled, however, to notice <num value="1">one</num> passage of your letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6657"/>Refering to it, you say: <quote>This I can not do; this I will not do. Such an idea was never thought of by me in any possible <pb id="p.517" n="517"/> contingency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6658"/>No allusion to it had ever been made in any communication between myself and any human being.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6659"/></p> 
<p>In reply to this statement, we are compelled to say that your conversation with us left upon our minds the distinct impression that you did seriously contemplate the withdrawal of the troops from <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6660"/>And, in support of this impression, we would add that we have the positive assurance of gentlemen of the highest possible public reputation and the most unsullied integrity&mdash;men whose name and fame, secured by long service and patriotic achievement, place their testimony beyond cavil&mdash;that such suggestions had been made to and urged upon you by them, and had formed the subject of more than <num value="1">one</num> earnest discussion with you. And it was this knowledge that induced us to urge upon you a policy which had to recommend it its own wisdom and the weight of such authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6661"/>As to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> point, that the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, instead of asking explanations, and giving you the opportunity to vindicate yourself, took possession of other property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, we would observe, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that, even if this were so, it does not avail you for defense, for the opportunity for decision was afforded you before these facts occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6662"/>We arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6663"/>The news from <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00517.01918" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> reached here early on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, and was immediately communicated to you. All that day, men of the highest consideration&mdash;men who had striven successfully to lift you to your great office &mdash;who had been your tried and true friends through the troubles of your Administration&mdash;sought you and entreated you to act&mdash;to act at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6664"/>They told you that every hour complicated your position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6665"/>They only asked you to give the assurance that, if the facts were so&mdash;if the commander had acted without and against your orders, and in violation of your pledges&mdash;you would restore the <hi rend="italics">status</hi> you had pledged your honor to maintain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6666"/>You refused to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6667"/>Your <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of War&mdash;your immediate and proper adviser in this whole matter&mdash;waited anxiously for your decision, until he felt that delay was becoming dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6668"/>More than <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> passed, and <num value="2">two</num> Cabinet meetings had adjourned before you knew what the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had done, and your prompt decision at any moment of that time would have avoided the subsequent complications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6669"/>But, if you had known the acts of the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, should that have prevented your keeping your faith?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6670"/>What was the condition of things?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6671"/>For the last <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, you have had in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName> not force enough to hold the forts against an equal enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6672"/><num value="2">Two</num> of them were empty; <num value="1">one</num> of those <num value="2">two</num>, the most important in the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6673"/>It could have been taken at any time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6674"/>You ought to know, better than any man, that it would have been taken, but for the efforts of those who put their trust in your honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6675"/>Believing that they were threatened by <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> especially, the people were, with difficulty, restrained from securing, with blood, the possession of this important fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6676"/>After many and reiterated assurances given on your behalf, which we can not believe unauthorized, they determined to forbear, and in good faith sent on their commissioners to negotiate with you. They meant you no harm, wished you no ill. They thought of you kindly, believed you true, and were willing, as far as it was consistent with duty, to spare you unnecessary and hostile collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6677"/>Scarcely had their commissioners left, than <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00517.01919" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> waged war. No other words will describe his action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6678"/>It was not a peaceful change from <num value="1">one</num> fort to another; it was a hostile act in the highest sense&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.518" n="518"/> only justified in the presence of a superior enemy and in imminent peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6679"/>He abandoned his position, spiked his guns, burned his gun-carriages, made preparations for the destruction of his post, and withdrew under cover of the night to a safer position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6680"/>This was war. No man could have believed (without your assurance) that any officer could have taken such a step, <quote>not only without orders, but against orders.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6681"/>What the <rs>State</rs> did was in simple self-defense; for this act, with all its attending circumstances, was as much war as firing a volley; and, war being thus begun, until those commencing it explained their action, and disavowed their intention, there was no room for delay; and, even at this moment, while we are writing, it is more than probable, from the tenor of your letter, that reinforcements are hurrying on to the conflict, so that, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun shall be fired, there will have been, on your part, <num value="1">one</num> continuous consistent series of actions commencing in a demonstration essentially warlike, supported by regular reinforcement, and terminating in defeat or victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6682"/>And all this without the slightest provocation; for, among the many things which you have said, there is <num value="1">one</num> thing you can not say&mdash;you have waited anxiously for news from the seat of war, in hopes that delay would furnish some excuse for this precipitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6683"/>But this <quote>tangible evidence of a design to proceed to a hostile act, on the part of the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName></quote> (which is the only justification of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00518.01920" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>), you are forced to admit <quote>has not <hi rend="italics">yet</hi> been alleged.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6684"/>But you have decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6685"/>You have resolved to hold by force what you have obtained through our misplaced confidence, and, by refusing to disavow the action of <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0057.00518.01921" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, have converted his violation of orders into a legitimate act of your Executive authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6686"/>Be the issue what it may, of this we are assured, that, if <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> has been recorded in history as a memorial of <orgName type="college" n="Carolina college">Carolina</orgName> gallantry, <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> will live upon the succeeding page as an imperishable testimony of <orgName type="college" n="Carolina college">Carolina</orgName> faith.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6687"/>By your course you have probably rendered civil war inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6688"/>Be it so. If you choose to force this issue upon us, the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> will accept it, and, relying upon Him who is the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of justice as well as the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of hosts, will endeavor to perform the great duty which lies before her, hopefully, bravely, and thoroughly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6696"/>I intended to adduce some evidences, which I thought were conclusive, in favor of the opinions which I entertain; but events, with a current hurrying on as it progresses, have borne me past the point where it would be useful for me to argue, by the citing of authorities, the question of rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6697"/>To-day, therefore, it is my purpose to deal with events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6698"/>Abstract argument has become among the things that are past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6699"/>We have to deal now with facts; and, in order that we may meet those facts and apply them to our present condition, it is well to inquire what is the state of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6700"/>The Constitution provides that the <rs>President</rs> shall, from time to time, communicate information on the state of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6701"/>The message which is now under consideration gives us very little, indeed, beyond that which the world&mdash;less, indeed, than reading men generally&mdash;knew before it was communicated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6702"/>What, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, to-day is the condition of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6703"/>From every corner of it comes the wailing cry of patriotism, pleading for the preservation of the great inheritance we derived from our fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6704"/>Is there a Senator who does not daily receive letters appealing to him to use even the small power which <num value="1">one</num> man here possesses to save the rich inheritance our fathers gave us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6705"/>Tears are trickling down the stern faces of men who have bled for the flag of their country, and are willing now to die for it; but patriotism stands powerless before the plea that the party about to come into power laid down a platform and that come what will, though ruin stare us in the face, consistency must be adhered to, even though the <rs>Government</rs> be lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6706"/>In this state of the case, then, we turn and ask, What is the character of the <name>Administration</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6707"/>What is the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive department</orgName> doing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6708"/>What assurance have we there for the safety of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6709"/>But we come back from that inquiry with a mournful conviction that feeble hands now hold the reins of state; that drivelers are taken in as counselors, not provided by the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that vacillation is the law; and the policy of this great Government is changed with every changing rumor of the day; nay, more, it is changing with every new phase of causeless fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6710"/>In this state of the case, after complications have been introduced into the question, after we were brought to the verge of war, after we were hourly expecting by telegraph to learn that the conflict had commenced, after nothing had been done to insure the peace of the land, we are told in this last hour that the question is thrown at the door of Congress, and here rests the responsibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6711"/>Had the garrison at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, representing the claim of the <rs>Government</rs> to hold the property in a fort there, been called away <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>, nay, <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago, peace would have spread its pinions over this land, and calm negotiation would have been the order of the day. Why was it not recalled?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6712"/>No reason yet has been <pb id="p.520" n="520"/> offered, save that the <rs>Government</rs> is bound to preserve its property; and yet look from North to South, from East to West, wherever we have constructed forts to defend States against a foreign foe, and everywhere you find them without a garrison, except at a few points where troops are kept for special purposes; not to coerce or to threaten a State, but stationed in seacoast fortifications, there merely for the purposes of discipline and instruction as artillerists You find all the other forts in the hands of fort-keepers and ordnance-sergeants, and, before a moral and patriotic people, standing safely there as the property of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6713"/>I asked in this Senate, weeks ago: <quote>What causes the peril that is now imminent at <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>; is it the weakness of the garrison?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6714"/>and then I answered, <quote>No, it is its presence, not its weakness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6715"/>Had an ordnance-sergeant there represented the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, had there been no troops, no physical power to protect it, I would have pledged my life upon the issue that no question ever would have been made as to its seizure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6716"/>Now, not only there, but elsewhere, we find movements of troops further to complicate this question, and probably to precipitate us upon the issue of civil war; and, worse than all, this Government, reposing on the consent of the governed; this Government, strong in the affections of the people; this Government (I describe it as our fathers made it) is now furtively sending troops to occupy positions lest <quote>the mob</quote> should seize them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6717"/>When before in the history of our land was it that a mob could resist the sound public opinion of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6718"/>When before was it that an unarmed magistrate had not the power, by crying, <quote>I command the peace,</quote> to quell a mob in any portion of the land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6719"/>Yet now we find, under cover of night, troops detached from <num value="1">one</num> position to occupy another.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6722"/><rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, the responsibility is thrown at the door of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6723"/>Let us take it. It is our duty in this last hour to seize the pillars of our Government and uphold them, though we be crushed in the fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6724"/>Then what is our policy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6725"/>Are we to drift into war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6726"/>Are we to stand idly by, and allow war to be precipitated upon the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6727"/>Allow an officer of the army to make war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6728"/>Allow an unconfirmed head of a department to make war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6729"/>Allow a general of the army to make war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6730"/>Allow a President to make war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6731"/>No, sir. Our fathers gave to Congress the power to declare war, and even to Congress they gave no power to make war upon a State of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6732"/>It could not have been given, except as a power to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6733"/>When, then, we see, as is evident to the whole country, that we are drifting into a war between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and an individual State, does it become the <name>Senate</name> to sit listlessly by and discuss abstract questions, and read patchwork from the opinions of men now mingled with the dust?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6734"/>Are we not bound to meet events as they come before us, manfully and patriotically to struggle with the difficulties which now oppress the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6736"/>In danger of what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6737"/>From whom comes the danger?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6738"/>Is there a man here who dreads that the deliberations of this body are to be interrupted by an armed force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6739"/>Is there <num value="1">one</num> who would not prefer to fall with dignity at his station, the representative of a great and peaceful Government, rather than to be protected by armed bands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6740"/>And yet the rumor is&mdash;and rumors seem now to be so authentic that we credit them rather than other means of information&mdash;that companies of artillery are to be quartered in this city to preserve peace, where the laws have heretofore been supreme, and that this District is to become a camp by calling out every able-bodied man within its limits to bear arms under the militia law. Are we invaded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>Is there an insurrection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>Are there <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> here who would not be willing to go forth as a file, and put down any resistance which showed itself in this District against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/>Is the reproach meant against these, my friends from the <rs>South</rs>, who advocate Southern rights and State rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>If so, it is a base slander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>We claim our rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>; we claim our rights reserved to the <name>States</name>; and we seek by no brute force to gain any advantage which the law and the <rs>Constitution</rs> do not give us. We have never appealed to mobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>We have never asked for the army and the navy to protect us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/><rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, we are rapidly drifting into a position in which this is to become a government of the army and navy; in which the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is to be maintained, not by law, not by constitutional agreement between the <name>States</name>, but by physical force; and will you stand still and see this policy consummated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>Will you fold your arms, the degenerate descendants of those men who proclaimed the eternal principle that government rests on the consent of the governed; and that every people have a right to change, modify, or abolish a government when it ceases to answer the ends for which it was established, and permit this Government imperceptibly to slide from the moorings where it was originally anchored, and become a military despotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6749"/>It was well said by the senator from New York [<persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00521.01927" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>], whom I do not now see in his seat&mdash;well said in a speech wherein I found but little to commend&mdash;that this Union could not be maintained by force, and that a Union of force was a despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6750"/>It was a great truth, come from what quarter it may. That was not the <rs>Government</rs> instituted by our fathers; and against it, so long as I live, with heart and hand, I will rebel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>This brings me to a passage in the message which says:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/><quote>I certainly had no right to make aggressive war upon any State; and I am perfectly satisfied that the <rs>Constitution</rs> has wisely withheld that power even from Congress<quote>&mdash;very good&mdash;</quote>but the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the <rs>Federal</rs> officers in the exercise of their legal functions, and against those who assail the power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, are clear and undeniable.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/></p> 
<p>Is it so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>Where does he get it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>Our fathers were so jealous of a standing <pb id="p.522" n="522"/> army, that they scarcely would permit the organization and maintenance of any army!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6756"/>Where does he get the <quote>clear and undeniable</quote> power to use the force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the manner he there proposes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6757"/>To execute a process, troops may be summoned in a <hi rend="italics">posse comitatus;</hi> and here, in the history of our Government, it is not to be forgotten that in the earlier and, as it is frequently said, the better days of the republic&mdash;and painfully we feel that they were better indeed&mdash;a President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> did not recur to the army; he went to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6758"/>Vaguely and confusedly, indeed, did the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> [<persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00522.01928" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,John,M.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>] bring forward the case of the great man, <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, as <num value="1">one</num> in which he had used a means which, he argued, was equivalent to the coercion of a State; for he said that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0125.0058.00522.01929" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:5"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> used the military power against a portion of a people of the <rs>State</rs>; and why might he not as well have used it against the whole State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>Let me tell that <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> that the case of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n0125.0058.00522.01930" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:5"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> has no such application as he supposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6760"/>It was a case of insurrection in the <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">State of Pennsylvania</placeName>; and the very message from which he read communicated the fact that <persName n="Mifflin,Governor,,,," id="n0125.0058.00522.01931" reg="mostcommon:Mifflin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Mifflin</surname></persName> thought it was necessary to call the militia of the adjoining States to aid him. <persName n="Washington,President,,,," id="n0125.0058.00522.01932" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:5"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> cooperated with <persName n="Mifflin,Governor,,,," id="n0125.0058.00522.01933" reg="mostcommon:Mifflin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Mifflin</surname></persName>; he called the militia of adjoining States to cooperate with those of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6761"/>He used the militia, not as a standing army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6762"/>It was by the consent of the <rs>Governor</rs>; it was by his advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6763"/>It was not the invasion of the <rs>State</rs>; it was not the coercion of the <rs>State</rs>; but it was aiding the <rs>State</rs> to put down insurrection, and in the very manner provided for in the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6764"/>But, I ask again, what power has the <rs>President</rs> to use the army and navy except to execute process?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6765"/>Are we to have drum-head courts substituted for those which the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws provide?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6766"/>Are we to have sergeants sent over the land instead of civil magistrates?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6767"/>Not so thought the elder <rs>Adams</rs>; and here, in passing, I will pay him a tribute he deserves, as the <num value="1">one</num> to whom, more than any other man among the early founders of this Government, credit is due for the military principles which prevail in its organization.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6771"/>Then, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, we are brought to consider passing events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6772"/>A little garrison in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> now occupies a post which, I am sorry to say, it gained by the perfidious breach of an understanding between the parties concerned; <pb id="p.523" n="523"/> and here, that I may do justice to <num value="1">one</num> who had not the power, on this floor at least, to right himself&mdash;who has no friend here to represent him&mdash;let me say that remark does not apply to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0058.00523.01939" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>; for I hold that, though his orders were not so designed, as I am assured, they did empower him to go from <num value="1">one</num> post to another, and to take his choice of the posts in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>; but in so doing he committed an act of hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6774"/>Vague rumors had reached him&mdash;and causeless fear seems now to be the impelling motive of every public act &mdash;vague rumors of an intention to take <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6775"/>But, sir, a soldier should be confronted by an overpowering force before he spikes his guns and burns his carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6776"/>A soldier should be confronted by a public enemy before he destroys the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> lest it should fall into the hands of such an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6777"/>Was that fort built to make war upon <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6778"/>Was an armament put into it for such a purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6779"/>Or was it built for the protection of <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston Harbor</placeName>; and was it armed to make that protection effective?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6780"/>If so, what right had any soldier to destroy that armament lest it should fall into the hands of <orgName type="college" n="Carolina college">Carolina</orgName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6781"/>Some time since I presented to the <name>Senate</name> resolutions which embodied my views upon this subject, drawing from the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself the data on which I based those resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6782"/>I then invoked the attention of the <name>Senate</name> in that form to the question as to whether garrisons should be kept within a State against the consent of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6783"/>Clear was I then, as I am now, in my conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6784"/>No garrison should be kept within a State, during a time of peace, if the <rs>State</rs> believes the presence of that garrison to be either offensive or dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6785"/>Our army is maintained for common defense; our forts are built out of the common Treasury, to which every State contributes; and they are perverted from the purpose for which they were erected whenever they are garrisond with a view to threaten, to intimidate, or to control a State in any respect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6822"/>It came more effectively from him than it would have done from me, had I (as I have not) a power to present it as forcibly as he has done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6823"/>Sirs, let me say, among the painful reflections which have crowded upon me by day and by night, none have weighed more heavily upon my heart than the reflection that our separation severs the ties which have so long bound us to our Northern friends, of whom we are glad to recognize the <rs>Senator</rs> as a type.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6824"/>Now let us return a moment to consider what would have been the state of the case if the garrison at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> had been withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6825"/>The fort would have stood there, not dismantled, but unoccupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6826"/>It would have stood there in the hands of an ordnance-sergeant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>Commissioners would have come to treat of all questions with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, of these forts as well as others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6828"/>They would have remained there to answer the ends for which they were constructed&mdash;the ends of defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6829"/>If <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> was an independent State, then she might hold to us such a relation as <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> held after the dissolution of the <name>Confederation</name> and before the formation of the <rs>Union</rs>, when <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> appealed to the sympathies existing between the <name>States</name> connected in the struggles of the <name>Revolution</name>, and asked that a commercial war should not be waged upon her. These forts would have stood there then to cover the harbor of a friendly State; and, if the feeling which once existed among the people of the <name>States</name> had subsisted still, and that fort had been attacked, brave men from every section would have rushed to the rescue, and there imperiled their lives in the defense of a State identified with their early history, and still associated in their breasts with affectionate memories; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of this kind would have been <num value="1">one</num> appealing to every generous motive of those people, again to reconsider the question of how we could live together, and through that bloody ordeal to have brought us into the position in which our fathers left us. There need have been no collision, as there could have been no question of property which that State was not ready to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>If it was a question of dollars and cents, they came here to adjust it. If it was a question of covering an interior State, their interests were identical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/>In whatever way the question could have been presented, the consequence would have been to relieve the <rs>Government</rs> of the charge of maintaining the fort, and to throw it upon the <rs>State</rs> which had resolved to be independent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6832"/>Thus we see that no evil could have resulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6833"/>We have yet to learn what evil the opposite policy may bring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6834"/>Telegraphic intelligence, by the man who occupied the seat on the right of me in the old Chamber, was never relied on. He was the wisest statesman I ever knew&mdash;a man whose prophetic vision foretold all the trials through which we are now passing; whose clear intellect, elaborating everything, borrowing nothing from anybody, seemed to dive into the future, and to unveil those things which are hidden to other eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6835"/>Need I say I mean <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0125.0058.00525.01943" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:3"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6836"/>No other man than he would have answered this description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6837"/>I say, then, not relying upon telegraphic dispatches, we still have information enough to notify us that we are on the verge of civil war; that civil war is in the hands of men irresponsible, as it seems to us; their acts unknown to us; their discretion not covered by any existing law or usage; and we now have the responsibility thrown upon us, which justifies us in demanding information to meet an emergency in which the country is involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6838"/><pb id="p.526" n="526"/></p> 
<p>Is there any point of pride which prevents us from withdrawing that garrison?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6839"/>I have heard it said by a gallant gentleman, to whom I make no special reference, that the great objection was an unwillingness to lower the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6840"/>To lower the flag!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6841"/>Under what circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6842"/>Does any man's courage impel him to stand boldly forth to take the life of his brethren?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6843"/>Does any man insist upon going upon the open field with deadly weapons to fight his brother on a question of courage?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6844"/>There is no point of pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6845"/>These are your brethren; and they have shed as much glory upon that flag as any equal number of men in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6846"/>They are the men, and that is the locality, where the <orgName n="Union Flag 1" type="newspaper">first Union flag</orgName> was unfurled, and where was fought a gallant battle before our independence was declared&mdash;not the flag with <num value="13">thirteen</num> stripes and <num value="33">thirty-three</num> stars, but a flag with a cross of <placeName key="tgn,2119878" n="1.000 4" reg="saint george, tucker, west virginia">St. George</placeName>, and the long stripes running through it. When the gallant <rs>Moultrie</rs> took the <rs>British</rs> <placeName reg="Three Trees, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096824">Fort Johnson</placeName> and carried it, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, I believe, did the <orgName n="Union Flag" type="newspaper">Union flag</orgName> fly in the air; and that was in <dateStruct value="1775-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6847"/>When he took the position and threw up a temporary battery with palmetto-logs and sand, upon the site called <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, that fort was assailed by the <orgName n="British fleet" type="fleet">British fleet</orgName>, and bombarded until the old logs, clinging with stern tenacity, were filled with balls, but the flag still floated there, and, though many bled, the garrison conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6848"/>Those old logs are gone; the eroding current is even taking away the site where <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> stood; the gallant men who held it now mingle with the earth; but their memories live in the hearts of a brave people, and their sons yet live, and they, like their fathers, are ready to bleed and die for the cause in which their fathers triumphed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6849"/>Glorious are the memories clinging around that old fort which now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, has been abandoned&mdash;abandoned not even in the presence of a foe, but under the maginings that a foe might come; and guns spiked and carriages burned where the band of <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName> bled, and, with an insufficient armament, repelled the common foe of all the colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6850"/>Her ancient history compares proudly with the present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6851"/>Can there, then, be a point of pride upon so sacred a soil as this, where the blood of the fathers cries to heaven against civil war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6852"/>Can there be a point of pride against laying upon that sacred soil to-day the flag for which our fathers died?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6853"/>My pride, <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, is different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/>My pride is that that flag shall not set between contending brothers; and that, when it shall no longer be the common flag of the country, it shall be folded up and laid away like a vesture no longer used; that it shall be kept as a sacred memento of the past, to which each of us can make a pilgrimage and remember the glorious days in which we were born.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/>In the answer of the commissioners which I caused to be read yesterday, I observed that they referred to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> as remaining a memento of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6856"/>It is an instance of the accuracy of the opinion which I have expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6857"/>It stood without a garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6858"/>It commanded the harbor, and the fort was known to have the armament in it capable of defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6859"/>Did the <name>Carolinians</name> attack it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6860"/>Did they propose to seize it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6861"/>It stood there safe as public property; and there it might have stood to the end of the negotiations without a question, if a garrison had not been sent into it. It was the faith on which they relied, that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would take no position of hostility to them, that constituted its safety, and by which they lost the advantage they would have had in seizing it when unoccupied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6862"/>I think that something is due to faith as well as fraternity; and I think <num value="1">one</num> of <pb id="p.527" n="527"/> the increasing and accumulative obligations upon us to withdraw the garrison from that fort is from the manner in which it was taken&mdash;taken, as we heard by the reading of the paper yesterday, while <orgName type="college" n="Carolina college">Carolina</orgName> remained under the assurance that the <hi rend="italics">status</hi> would not be violated; while I was under that assurance, and half a dozen other <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> now within the sound of my voice felt secure under the same pledge, that nothing would be done until negotiations had terminated, unless it was to withdraw the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6863"/>Then we, the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, broke the faith; we committed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of hostility; and from this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of hostility arose all those acts to which reference is made in the message as unprovoked aggressions&mdash;the seizing of forts elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6864"/>Why were they seized?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6865"/>Self-preservation is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> law of nature; and when they no longer had confidence that this Federal Government would not seize the forts constructed for their defense, and use them for their destruction, they only obeyed the dictates of self-preservation when they seized the forts to prevent the enemy from taking possession of them as a means of coercion, for they then were compelled to believe this Federal Government had become an enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6866"/>Now, what is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6867"/>To assure them that you do not intend to use physical force against them is your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> remedy; to assure them that you intend to consider calmly all the propositions which they make, and to recognize the rights which the <rs>Union</rs> was established to secure; that you intend to settle with them upon a basis in accordance with the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> and the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6868"/>When you do that, peace will prevail over the land, and force become a thing that no man will consider necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6869"/>I am here confronted with a question which I will not argue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6870"/>The position which I have taken necessarily brings me to its consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6871"/>Without arguing it, I will merely state it. It is the right of a State to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6872"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> says it is not a constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6873"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName key="tgn,7007706" n="1.000 5" reg="ohio">Ohio</placeName> [<persName n="Wade,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00527.01944" reg="mostcommon:Wade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName>], and his ally, the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> [<persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00527.01945" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,John,M.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>], argued it as no right at all. Well, let us see. What is meant by a constitutional right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6874"/>Is it meant to be a right derived from the <rs>Constitution</rs>&mdash;a grant made in the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6875"/>If that is what is meant, of course we all see at once that we do not derive it in that way. Is it intended that it is not a constitutional right, because it is not granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6876"/>That shows, indeed, but a poor appreciation of the nature of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6877"/>All that is not granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs> belongs to the <name>States</name>; and nothing but what is granted in the <rs>Constitution</rs> belongs to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; and, keeping this distinction in view, it requires but little argument to see the conclusion at which we necessarily arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6878"/>Did the <name>States</name> surrender their sovereignty to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6879"/>Did the <name>States</name> agree that they never could withdraw from the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6880"/>I know it has been argued here that the <name>Confederation</name> said the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation were to be a perpetual bond of union, and that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was made to form a more perfect union; that is to say, a Government beyond perpetuity, or <num value="1">one</num> day, or <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, after doomsday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6881"/>But that has no foundation in the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself; it has no basis in the nature of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6882"/>The Constitution was a compact between independent States; it was not a national Government; and hence <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00527.01946" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> answered with such effectiveness to <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, in the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Convention of Virginia</orgName>, which ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs>, denying his proposition that it was to form a nation, and stating to him the <pb id="p.528" n="528"/> conclusive fact that <quote>we sit here as a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">convention of the State</orgName> to ratify or reject that Constitution; and how, then, can you say that it forms a nation, and is adopted by the mass of the people?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6883"/>It was not adopted by the mass of the people, as we all know historically; it was adopted by each State; each State, voluntarily ratifying it, entered the <rs>Union</rs>; and that Union was formed whenever <num value="9">nine</num> States should enter it; and, in abundance of caution, it was stated, in the resolutions of ratification of <num value="3">three</num> of the <name>States</name>, that they still possessed the power to withdraw the grants which they had delegated, whenever they should be used to their injury or oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6884"/>I know it is said that this meant the people of all the <name>States</name>; but that is such an absurdity that I suppose it hardly necessary to answer it&mdash;for to speak of an elective Government rendering itself injurious and oppressive to the whole body of the people by whom it is elected is such an absurdity that no man can believe it; and to suppose that a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State convention</orgName>, speaking for a State and having no authority to speak for anybody else, would say that it was declaring what the people of the other States would do, would be an assumption altogether derogatory to the sound sense and well-known sentiments of the men who formed the <rs>Constitution</rs> and ratified it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6885"/>But in abundance of caution not only was this done, but the <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> declared that all which had not been delegated was reserved to the <name>States</name> or to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6886"/>Now, I ask, where among the delegated grants to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> do you find any power to coerce a State; where among the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs> do you find any prohibition on the part of a State to withdraw; and, if you find neither <num value="1">one</num> nor the other, must not this power be in that great depository, the reserved rights of the <name>States</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6887"/>How was it ever taken out of that source of all power to be given to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6888"/>It was not delegated to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; it was not prohibited to the <name>States</name>; it necessarily remains, then, among the reserved powers of the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6889"/>This question has been so forcibly argued by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> [<persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00528.01947" reg="nearbymention:Benjamin,J.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>] that I think it unnecessary to pursue it. <num value="3">Three</num> times the proposition was made to give power to coerce the <name>States</name>, in the <rs>Convention</rs>, and as often refused&mdash;opposed as a proposition to make war on a State, and refused on the ground that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> could not make war upon a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6890"/>The Constitution was to form a Government for such States as should unite; it had no application beyond those who should voluntarily adopt it. Among the delegated powers there is none which interferes with the exercise of the right of secession by a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6891"/>As a right of sovereignty it remained to the <name>States</name> under the <name>Confederation</name>; and, if it did not, you arraign the faith of the men who framed the <rs>Constitution</rs> to which you appeal, for they provided that <num value="9">nine</num> States should secede from <num value="13">thirteen</num>. <num value="11">Eleven</num> did secede from the <num value="13">thirteen</num>, and put themselves in the very position which, by a great abuse of language, is to-day called treason, against the <num value="2">two</num> States of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>; they still claiming to adhere to the perpetual Articles of Confederation, these <num value="11">eleven</num> States absolving themselves from the obligations which arose under them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6893"/>I will read a single paragraph from his speech, showing what his language is, in order that I may <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> not, by any possibility, produce an impression upon others which his language does not justify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6894"/>Here are the expressions to which I refer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6895"/>I call the <rs>Senator</rs>'s attention to them:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6897"/>We can then say to them, <q direct="unspecified">You have refused to give us guarantees that we think are needed for the protection of our institutions and for the protection of our interests.</q>

<p>Now, it does appear that he will go that far; and he goes a little further than anybody, I believe, who has spoken in vindication of the right, for he says:</p>

<p>What does that mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6909"/>In the name of common sense, I ask how are we to fight in the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6916"/>What I mean by fighting the battle in the <rs>Union</rs> is, I think, very distinctly and clearly set forth in my speech; and, if the <rs>Senator</rs> will take it from beginning to end, I apprehend that he will have no difficulty in ascertaining what I meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6917"/>But, for his gratification upon this particular point, I will repeat, in substance, what I then said as to fighting the battle in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6918"/>I meant that we should remain here under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and contend for all its guarantees; and by preserving the <rs>Constitution</rs> and all its guarantees we would preserve the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6919"/>Our true place, to maintain these guarantees and to preserve the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is in the <rs>Union</rs>, there to fight our battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6920"/>How? By argument; by appeals to the patriotism, to the good sense, and to the judgment of the whole country; by showing the people that the <rs>Constitution</rs> had been violated; that all its guarantees were not complied with; and I have entertained the hope that, when they were possessed of that fact, there would be found patriotism and honesty enough in the great mass of the people, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, to come forward and do what was just and right between the contending sections of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6921"/>I meant that the true way to fight the battle was for us to remain here and occupy the places assigned to us by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6922"/>Why did I make that statement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6923"/>It was because on the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> next we shall have <num value="6">six</num> majority in this body; and if, as some apprehended, the incoming Administration shall show any disposition to make encroachments upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, encroachments upon the rights of the <name>States</name>, or any other violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, we, by remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>, and standing at our places, will have the power to resist all these encroachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6924"/>How? We have the power even to reject the appointment of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> officers of the incoming <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>Then, should we not be fighting the battles in the <rs>Union</rs>, by resisting even the organization of the <name>Administration</name> in a constitutional mode, and thus, at the very start, disable an Administration which was likely to encroach on our rights and to violate the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>So far as appointing even a Minister abroad is concerned, the incoming Administration will have no power without our consent, if we remain here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/>It comes into office handcuffed, powerless to do harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>We, standing here, hold the balance of power in our hands; we can resist it at the very threshold effectually; and do it inside of the <rs>Union</rs>, and in our <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0125.0058.00530.01951" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>The incoming Administration has not even the power to appoint a postmaster whose salary exceeds <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> a year, without consultation with and the acquiescense of the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>The army and navy cannot be sustained without appropriations by Congress; and, if we were apprehensive that encroachments would be made on the <rs>Southern States</rs> and on their institutions, in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, we could prevent him from having a dollar even to feed his army or his navy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/>I am entirely satisfied that the answer the <rs>Senator</rs> shows me he did not intend to fight at all; that it was a mere figure of speech, and does not justify converting the <rs>Federal</rs> capital into a military camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>But it is a sort of revolution which he proposes; it is a revolution under the forms of the <pb id="p.531" n="531"/> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/>Now, I have to say, once for all, that, as long as I am a Senator here, I will not use the powers I possess to destroy the very Government to which I am accredited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>I will not attempt to destroy the <name>Administration</name> by refusing any officers to administer its functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>I should vote, as I have done in Administrations to which I stood in nearest relation, against a bad nomination; but I never would agree, under the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and with the powers I bear as a Senator of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to turn those powers to the destruction of the <rs>Government</rs> I was sent to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>I leave that to gentlemen who take the oath with a mental reservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>So much for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>It has quieted apprehension; and I hope that the artillery will not be brought here; that the militia will not be called out; and that the female schools will continue their sessions as heretofore.

<p>Now, sir, we are confusing language very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/>Men speak of revolution; and when they say revolution they mean blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6952"/>Our fathers meant nothing of the sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6953"/>When they spoke of revolution they meant an unalienable right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/>When they declared as an unalienable right the power of the people to abrogate and modify their form of government whenever it did not answer the ends for which it was established, they did not mean that they were to sustain that by brute force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>They meant that it was a right; and force could only be invoked when that right was wrongfully denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6956"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> denied the right in the case of the colonies, and therefore our revolution for independence was bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>Are we, in this age of civilization and political progress, when political philosophy had advanced to the point which seemed to render it possible that the millennium should now be seen by prophetic eyes&mdash;are we now to roll back the whole current of human thought, and again to return to the mere brute force which prevails between beasts of prey, as the only method of settling questions between men?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6960"/>Is it to be supposed; could any man, reasoning a <hi rend="italics">priori</hi>, come to the conclusion that the men who fought the battles of the <name>Revolution</name> for community independence&mdash;that the men who struggled against the then greatest military power on the face of the globe in order that they might possess those unalienable rights which they had declared&mdash;terminated their great <pb id="p.532" n="532"/> efforts by transmitting posterity to a condition in which they could only gain those rights by force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>I see, then&mdash;if gentlemen insist on using the word <quote>revolution</quote> in the sense of a resort to force&mdash;a very great difference between their opinion and that of <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00532.01958" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>. <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00532.01959" reg="mostcommon:Madison,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> put the rights of the people over and above everything else, and he said this was the <rs>Government</rs> <hi rend="italics">de jure</hi> and <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>The people never have separated themselves from those rights which our fathers had declared to be unalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6964"/>They did not delegate to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> the powers which the <rs>British Crown</rs> exercised over the colonies; they did not achieve their independence for any purpose so low as that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/>They left us to the inheritance of freemen, living in independent communities, the <name>States</name> united for the purposes which they thought would bless posterity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6967"/>The question which now presents itself to the country is, What shall we do with events as they stand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6968"/>Shall we allow this separation to be total?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6969"/>Shall we render it peaceful, with a view to the chance that, when hunger shall brighten the intellects of men, and the teachings of hard experience shall have tamed them, they may come back, in the spirit of our fathers, to the task of reconstruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6970"/>Or will they have that separation partial; will they give to each State all its military power; will they give to each State its revenue power; will they still preserve the common agent, and will they thus carry on a Government different from that which now exists, yet not separating the <name>States</name> so entirely as to make the work of reconstruction equal to a new creation; not separating them so as to render it utterly impossible to administer any functions of the <rs>Government</rs> in security and peace?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6973"/>There is no duality possible (unless there be <num value="2">two</num> confederacies) which seems to me consistent with the interests of either or of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6974"/>It might be that <num value="2">two</num> confederacies could be so organized as to answer jointly many of the ends of our present Union; it might be that States, agreeing with each other in their internal policy&mdash;having a similarity of interests and an identity of purpose&mdash;might associate together, and that these <num value="2">two</num> confederacies might have relations to each other so close as to give them a united power in time of war against any foreign nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6975"/>These things are possibilities; these things it becomes us to contemplate; these things it devolves on the majority section to consider now; for with every motion of that clock is passing away your opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6976"/>It was greater when we met on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monday in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> than it is now; it is greater now than it will be on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of next week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6977"/>We have waited long; we have come to the conclusion that you mean to do nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6978"/>In the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="13">Thirteen</num>, where the resolutions of the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> [<persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00532.01961" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,J.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>] were considered, various <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> attempts were made, but no prospect of any agreement on which it was possible for us to stand, in security for the future, could be matured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6982"/>It can only be done by adopting a policy of peace.

<p>I do not regard the failure of our <orgName n="Constitutional Union" type="union">constitutional Union</orgName>, as very many do, to be the failure of self-government&mdash;to be conclusive in all future time of the unfitness of man to govern himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6989"/>Liberty was not crushed by the separation of the colonies from the mother-country, then the most constitutional monarchy and the freest Government known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6990"/>Still less will liberty be destroyed by the separation of these States, to prevent the destruction of the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs> by the mal-administration of it. There will be injury&mdash;injury to all; differing in degree, differing in manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6994"/>I would that it still remained to consider what we might calmly have considered on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monday in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>&mdash;how this could be avoided; but events have rolled past that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6995"/>You would not make propositions when they would have been effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6996"/>I presume you will not make them now; and I know not what effect they would have if you did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6997"/>But you have chosen to take the policy of clinging to words [the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform], in disregard of passing events, and have hastened them onward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6998"/>It is true, as shown by the history of all revolutions, that they are most precipitated and intensified by obstinacy and vacillation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6999"/>The want of a policy, the obstinate adherence to unimportant things, have brought us to a condition where I close my eyes, because I can not see anything that encourages me to hope.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7000"/>In the long period which elapsed after the downfall of the great republics of the <rs>East</rs>, when despotism seemed to brood over the civilized world, and only here and there constitutional monarchy even was able to rear its head&mdash;when all the great principles of republican and representative government had sunk deep, <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> fathomless, into the sea of human events&mdash;it was then that the storm of our Revolution moved the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7001"/>The earth, the air, and the sea became brilliant; and from the foam of ages rose the constellation which was set in the political firmament, as a sign of unity and confederation and community independence, coexistent with confederate strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7002"/>That constellation has served to bless our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7003"/>Nay, more; its light has been thrown on foreign lands, and its regenerative power will outlive, perhaps, the <rs>Government</rs> as a sign for which its was set. It may be pardoned to me, sir, who, in my boyhood, was given to the military service, and who have followed, under tropical suns and over northern snows, the flag of the <rs>Union</rs>, if I here express the deep sorrow which always overwhelms me when I think of taking a last leave of that object of early affection and proud association; feeling that henceforth it is not to be the banner which, by day and by night, I was ready to follow; to hail with the rising and bless with the setting sun. But <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who knows the hearts of men, will judge between you and us, at whose door lies the responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7004"/>Men will see the efforts made, here and elsewhere; that we have been silent when words would not avail, and have curbed an impatient temper, and hoped that conciliatory counsels might do that which could not be effected by harsh means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7005"/>And yet, the only response which has come from the other side has been a stolid indifference, as though it mattered not: <quote>Let the temple fall, we do not care!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7006"/>Sirs, remember that such conduct is offensive, and that men may become indifferent even to the objects of their early attachments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7007"/>If our Government should fail, it will not be from the defect of the system, though each planet was set to revolve in an orbit of its own, each moving by its own impulse, yet being all attracted by the affections and interests which countervailed each other; there was no inherent tendency to disruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7008"/>It has been the perversion of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; it has been the substitution of theories of morals for principles of government; it has been forcing crude opinions upon the domestic institutions of others, which has disturbed these planets in their orbit; it is this which threatens to destroy the constellation which, in its power and its glory, had been gathering stars <num value="1">one</num> after another, until, from <num value="13">thirteen</num>, it had risen to <num value="33">thirty-three</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7009"/>If we accept the argument of to-day in favor of coercion as the theory of our Government, its only effect will be to precipitate men who have pride and self-reliance into the assertion of the freedom and independence to which they were born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7010"/>Our fathers would never have entered into a <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">confederate Government</orgName> which had within itself the power of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7011"/>I would not agree to remain <num value="1">one</num> day in such a Government after I had the power to get out of it. To argue that the man who follows the mandate of his State, resuming her sovereign jurisdiction and power, is disloyal to his allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which allegiance he only owed through his State, is such a confusion of ideas as does not belong to an ordinary comprehension of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7012"/>It is treason to the principle of community independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7013"/>It is to recur to that doctrine of passive obedience which, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, cost <num value="1">one</num> monarch his head and drove another into exile; a doctrine which, since the <name>Revolution</name> of <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct>, has obtained nowhere where men speak the <rs>English</rs> tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7014"/>Yet all this it is needful to admit, before we accept this doctrine of coercion, which is to send an army and a navy to do that which there are no courts to perform; to execute the law without a judicial decision, and without an <pb id="p.535" n="535"/> officer to serve process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7015"/>This, I say, would degrade us to the basest despotism under which man could live&mdash;the despotism of a many-headed monster, without the sensibility or regardful consideration which might belong to an hereditary king.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7017"/>There is a strange similarity in the position of affairs at the present day to that which the colonies occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7018"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName> asserted the right to collect the revenue, and insisted on collecting it by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7019"/>He sent troops to <placeName key="tgn,1114422" n="1.000 1" reg="boston harbor, massachusetts, united states">Boston Harbor</placeName> and to <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>, and he quartered troops in those towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7020"/>The result was, collision; and out of that collision came the separation of the colonies from the mother-country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7021"/>The same thing is being attempted to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7022"/>Not the law, not the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Magistrate">civil magistrate</rs>, but troops, are relied upon now to execute the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7023"/>To gather taxes in the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, the army and navy must be sent to perform the functions of magistrates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7024"/>It is the old case over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7025"/><rs type="role" reg="Senator">Senators</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>, you are reenacting the blunders which statesmen in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> committed; but among you there are some who, like <persName n="Chatham,,,,," id="n0125.0058.00535.01962" reg="mostcommon:Chatham,nomatch:0"><surname>Chatham</surname></persName> and <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0125.0058.00535.01963" reg="mostcommon:Burke,Edmund,,,:2"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, though not of our section, yet are vindicating our rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7026"/>I have heard, with some surprise, for it seemed to me idle, the repetition of the assertion heretofore made, that the cause of the separation was the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00535.01964" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7027"/>It may be a source of gratification to some gentlemen that their friend is elected; but no individual had the power to produce the existing state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7028"/>It was the purpose, the end, it was the declaration by himself and his friends, which constitute the necessity of providing new safeguards for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7029"/>The man was nothing, save as he was the representative of opinions, of a policy, of purposes, of power, to inflict upon us those wrongs to which freemen never tamely submit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7030"/><rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, I have spoken longer than I desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7031"/>I had supposed it was possible, avoiding argument and not citing authority, to have made to you a brief address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7032"/>It was thought useless to argue a question which now belongs to the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7033"/>The time is near at hand when the places which have known us as colleagues laboring together can know us in that relation no more for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7034"/>I have striven to avert the catastrophe which now impends over the country, unsuccessfully; and I regret it. For the few days which I may remain, I am willing to labor in order that that catastrophe shall be as little as possible destructive to public peace and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7035"/>If you desire at this last moment to avert civil war, so be it; it is better so. If you will but allow us to separate from you peaceably, since we can not live peaceably together, to leave with the rights we had before we were united, since we can not enjoy them in the <rs>Union</rs>, then there are many relations which may still subsist between us, drawn from the associations of our struggles from the <name>Revolutionary</name> era to the present day, which may be beneficial to you as well as to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7036"/>If you will not have it thus&mdash;if in the pride of power, if in contempt of reason, and reliance upon force, you say we shall not go, but shall remain as subjects to you&mdash;then, gentlemen of the <rs>North</rs>, a war is to be inaugurated the like of which men have not seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7037"/>Sufficiently numerous on both sides, in close contact, with only imaginary lines of division, and with many means of approach, each <pb id="p.536" n="536"/> sustained by productive sections, the people of which will give freely both of money and of store, the conflicts must be multiplied indefinitely, and masses of men, sacrificed to the demon of civil war, will furnish hecatombs, such as the recent campaign in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> did not offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7038"/>At the end of all this what will you have effected?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7039"/>Destruction upon both sides; subjugation upon neither; a treaty of peace leaving both torn and bleeding; the wail of the widow and the cry of the orphan substituted for those peaceful notes of domestic happiness that now prevail throughout the land; and then you will agree that each is to pursue his separate course as best he may. This is to be the end of war. Through a long series of years you may waste your strength, distress your people, and yet at last must come to the position which you might have had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, had justice and reason, instead of selfishness and passion, folly and crime, dictated your course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7040"/>Is there wisdom, is there patriotism in the land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7041"/>If so, easy must be the solution of this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7042"/>If not, then <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>'s gallant sons will stand like a wall of fire around their State; and I go hence, not in hostility to you, but in love and allegiance to her, to take my place among her sons, be it for good or for evil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7043"/>I shall probably never again attempt to utter here the language either of warning or of argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7044"/>I leave the case in your hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7045"/>If you solve it not before I go, you will have still to decide it. Toward you individually, as well as to those whom you represent, I would that I had the power now to say there shall be peace between us for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7046"/>I would that I had the power now to say the intercourse and the commerce between the <name>States</name>, if they can not live in <num value="1">one</num> Union, shall still be uninterrupted; that all the social relations shall remain undisturbed; that the son in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> shall visit freely his father in <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, and the reverse; and that each shall be welcomed when he goes to the other, not by himself alone, but also by his neighbors; and that all that kindly intercourse which has subsisted between the different sections of the <rs>Union</rs> shall continue to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7047"/>This is not only for the interest of all, but it is my profoundest wish, my sincerest desire, that such remnant of that which is passing away may grace the memory of a glorious though too brief existence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7048"/>Day by day you have become more and more exasperated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7049"/>False reports have led you to suppose there was in our section hostility to you with manifestations which did not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7050"/>In <num value="1">one</num> case, I well remember when the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> [<persName n="Collamer,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0058.00536.01965" reg="mostcommon:Collamer,&mdash;,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Collamer</surname></persName>] was serving with me on a <orgName n="Special Committee" type="committee">special committee</orgName>, it was reported that a gentleman who had gone from a commercial house in New York had been inhumanly treated at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and this embarrassed a question which we then had pending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7051"/>I wrote to <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> for information, and my friends could not learn that such a man had ever been there; but, if he had been there, no violence certainly had been offered to him. Falsehood and suspicion have thus led you on step by step in the career of crimination, and perhaps has induced to some part of your aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7052"/>Such evil effects we have heretofore suffered, and the consequences now have their fatal culmination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7053"/>On the verge of war, distrust and passion increase the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7054"/>To-day it is in the power of <num value="2">two</num> bad men, at the opposite ends of the telegraphic line between <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, to precipitate the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> into a conflict of arms without other cause to have produced it. And still will you hesitate; still will you do nothing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7055"/>Will you sit with sublime indifference and allow events to shape themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7056"/>No longer can you say the responsibility is upon the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7057"/><pb id="p.537" n="537"/> He has thrown it upon you. He has notified you that he can do nothing; and you therefore know he will do nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7058"/>He has told you the responsibility now rests with Congress; and I close as I began, by invoking you to meet that responsibility, bravely to act the patriot's part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7059"/>If you will, the angel of peace may spread her wings, though it be over divided States; and the sons of the sires of the <name>Revolution</name> may still go on in friendly intercourse with each other, ever renewing the memories of a common origin; the sections, by the diversity of their products and habits, acting and reacting beneficially, the commerce of each may swell the prosperity of both, and the happiness of all be still interwoven together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7071"/>sir: Your letter has been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7072"/>In it you make certain statements which very plainly show that you have not been fully informed by your Government of the precise relations which now exist between it and the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>Official information has been communicated to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that the political connection heretofore existing between the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> and the <name>States</name> which were known as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had ceased, and that the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> had resumed all the power it had delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under the compact known as the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7074"/>The right which the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> possessed to change the political relations it held with other States, under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, has been solemnly asserted by the people of this State, in convention, and now does not admit of discussion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7075"/>The attempt to reenforce the troops now at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, or to retake and resume possession of the forts within the waters of this State, which you have <pb id="p.539" n="539"/> abandoned, after spiking the guns placed there, and doing otherwise much damage, can not be regarded by the authorities of this State as indicative of any other purpose than the coercion of this State by the armed force of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7076"/>To repel such an attempt is too plainly its duty to allow it to be discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>But, while defending its waters, the authorities of the <rs>State</rs> have been careful so to conduct the affairs of the <rs>State</rs> that no act, however necessary for its defense, should lead to a useless waste of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7078"/><rs type="role" reg="Special-Agent">Special agents</rs>, therefore, have been off the bar, to warn all approaching vessels, if armed, or unarmed and having troops to reenforce the forts on board, not to enter the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>; and special orders have been given to the commanders of all the forts and batteries not to fire at such vessels until a shot fired across their bows would warn them of the prohibition of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7079"/>Under these circumstances, the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName>, it is understood, this morning attempted to enter this harbor, with troops on board; and, having been notified that she could not enter, was fired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7112"/>We know that the possession of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, coupled with the circumstances under which it was taken, is the chief, if not only, source of difficulty between the government of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7113"/>We would add that we, too, think it a just cause of irritation and of apprehension on the part of your State.

<p>We will not discuss the question of right or duty on the part of either Government touching that property, or the late acts of either in relation thereto; but we think that, without any compromise of right or breach of duty on either side, an amicable adjustment of the matter of differences may and should be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7170"/>The next day, before such communication could be made, I was waited upon by a Senator from <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, who stated that he came on the part of all the <rs>Senators</rs> then in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> from the <name>States</name> which had already seceded from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or would certainly have done so before the <dateStruct value="-02-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> day of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7171"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> urged that he and they were interested in the subject of my mission in almost an equal degree with the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7172"/>He said that hostilities commenced between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and your Government would necessarily involve the <name>States</name> represented by themselves in civil strife, and, fearing that the action of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> might complicate the relations of your Government to the seceded and seceding States, and thereby interfere with a peaceful solution of existing difficulties, these <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> requested that I would withhold my message to yourself until a consultation among themselves could be had. To this I agreed, and the result of the consultation was the letter of these <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> addressed to me, dated <dateStruct value="-01-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, a copy of which is in your possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7173"/>To this letter I replied on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct>, and a copy of that reply is likewise in your possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7174"/>This correspondence, as I am informed, was made the subject of a communication from <persName n="Fitzpatrick,Senator,,,," id="n0125.0059.00546.02042" reg="nearbymention:Fitzpatrick,Benjamin,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senators</roleName> <surname>Fitzpatrick</surname></persName>, <persName n="Mallory,Senator,,,," id="n0125.0059.00546.02043" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Senator"></roleName><surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Slidell,Senator,,,," id="n0125.0059.00546.02044" reg="nearbymention:Slidell,John,,,"><roleName n="Senator"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, addressed to you, and your attention called to the contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7175"/>These gentlemen received on the <dateStruct value="-01-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> day of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> a reply to their application, conveyed in a letter addressed to them, dated the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>, signed by <persName n="Holt,the Honorable,J.,,," id="n0125.0059.00546.02045" reg="expanded:Holt,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName>, <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> ad interim</hi>. Of this letter you of course have a copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7176"/>This letter from <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0059.00546.02046" reg="nearbymention:Holt,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName> was communicated to me under the cover of a letter from all the <rs>Senators</rs> of the seceded and seceding States, who still remained in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 13" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>; and of this letter, too, I am informed you have been furnished with a copy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7177"/>This reply of yours through the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> ad interim</hi> to the application made by the <rs>Senators</rs>, was entirely unsatisfactory to me. It appeared to me to be not only a rejection in advance of the main proposition made by these <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, to wit, that <quote>an arrangement should be agreed on between the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and your Government, at least until the <dateStruct value="-02-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> next, <pb id="p.547" n="547"/> by which time <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <name>States</name> represented by the <rs>Senators</rs> might, in convention, devise a wise, just, and peaceable solution of existing difficulties</quote>; <quote>in the mean time,</quote> they say, <quote>we think</quote> (that is, these <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>) <quote>that your State</quote> (<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>) <quote>should suffer <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0059.00547.02047" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> to obtain necessary supplies of food, fuel, or water, and enjoy free communication, by post or special messenger, with the <rs>President</rs>, upon the understanding that the <rs>President</rs> will not send him reenforcements during the same period</quote>; but, besides this rejection of the main proposition, there was in <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0059.00547.02048" reg="nearbymention:Holt,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName>'s letter a distinct refusal to make any stipulation on the subject of reenforcement, even for the short time that might be required to communicate with my government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7178"/>This reply to the <rs>Senators</rs> was, as I have stated, altogether unsatisfactory to me, and I felt sure that it would be so to the authorities whom I represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7179"/>It was not, however, addressed to me, or to the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>; and, as <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had addressed nothing to your Government, and had asked nothing at your hands, I looked not to <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0059.00547.02049" reg="nearbymention:Holt,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName>'s letter but to the note addressed to me by the <rs>Senators</rs> of the seceded and seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7180"/>I had consented to withhold my message at <hi rend="italics">their</hi> instance, provided they could get assurances <hi rend="italics">satisfactory to them</hi> that no reenforcements would be sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in the interval, and that the peace should not be disturbed by any act of hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7181"/>The <rs>Senators</rs> expressed, in their note to me of the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="23">23d instant</day></dateStruct>, their <quote>entire confidence that no reinforcements will be sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, nor will the public peace be disturbed within the period requisite for full communication between you (myself) and your (my) Government</quote>; and renewed their request that I would withhold the communication with which I stood charged, and await further instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7182"/>This I have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7183"/>The further instructions arrived on the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="30">30th instant</day></dateStruct> and bear date the <num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7184"/>I now have the honor to make to you my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> communication as special envoy from the government of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7185"/>You will find inclosed the original communication to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, with which I was charged in <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-01-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> day of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, instant, the day on which it bears date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7186"/>I am now instructed by the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to say that <quote>his opinion as to the propriety of the demand which is contained in this letter has not only been confirmed by the circumstances which your (my) mission has developed, but is now increased to a conviction of its necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7187"/>The safety of the <rs>State</rs> requires that the position of the <rs>President</rs> should be distinctly understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7188"/>The safety of all seceding States requires it as much as the safety of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7189"/>If it be so, that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is held as <hi rend="italics">property</hi>, then as property, the rights, whatever they may be, of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can be ascertained, and for the satisfaction of these rights the pledge of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> you are</quote> (I am) <quote>authorized to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7190"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is not held as property, it is held,</quote> say my instructions, <quote>as a military post, and such a post within the limits of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, can not be tolerated.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7191"/></p> 
<p>You will perceive that it is upon the presumption that it is solely as property that you continue to hold <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> that I have been selected for the performance of the duty upon which I have entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7192"/>I do not come as a military man to demand the surrender of a fortress, but as the legal officer of the <rs>State</rs>, its <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, to claim for the <rs>State</rs> the exercise of its undoubted right of eminent domain, and to pledge the <rs>State</rs> to make good all injury to the rights of property which may arise from the exercise of the claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7193"/><pb id="p.548" n="548"/></p> 
<p><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, as a separate, independent sovereignty, assumes the right to take into her possession everything within her limits essential to maintain her honor or her safety, irrespective of the question of property, subject only to the moral duty requiring that compensation should be made to the owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7194"/>This right she can not permit to be drawn into discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7195"/>As to compensation for any property, whether of an individual or a Government, which she may deem it necessary for her honor or safety to take into her possession, her past history gives ample guarantee that it will be made, upon a fair accounting, to the last dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7196"/>The proposition now is, that her law officer should, under authority of the <rs>Governor</rs> and his Council, distinctly pledge the faith of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to make such compensation in regard to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and its appurtenances and contents, to the full extent of the money value of the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> delivered over to the authorities of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> by your command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7197"/>I will not suppose that a pledge like this can be considered insufficient security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7198"/>Is not the money value of the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in this fort, situated where it can not be made available to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for any <num value="1">one</num> purpose for which it was originally constructed, worth more to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than the property itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7199"/>Why, then, <hi rend="italics">as property</hi>, insist on holding it by an armed garrison?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7200"/>Yet such has been the ground upon which you have invariably placed your occupancy of this fort by troops; beginning, prospectively, with your annual message of the <dateStruct value="-12-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>; again in your special message of the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> [<num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>] <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, and still more emphatically in your message of the <dateStruct value="-01-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7201"/>The same position is set forth in your reply to the <rs>Senators</rs>, through the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> ad <hi rend="italics">interim</hi>. It is there virtually conceded that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> <quote>is held merely as property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which you deem it your duty to protect and preserve.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7202"/></p> 
<p>Again, it is submitted that the continuance of an armed possession actually jeopards the property you desire to protect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7203"/>It is impossible but that such a possession, if continued long enough, must lead to collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7204"/>No people, not completely abject and pusillanimous, could submit, indefinitely, to the armed occupation of a fortress in the midst of the harbor of its principal city, and commanding the ingress and egress of every ship that enters the port, the daily ferryboats that ply upon the waters moving but at the sufferance of aliens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7205"/>An attack upon this fort would scarcely improve it as property, whatever the result; and, if captured, it would no longer be the subject of account.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7206"/>To protect <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> merely as property, it is submitted that an armed occupancy is not only unnecessary, but that it is manifestly the worst possible means which can be resorted to for such an object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7207"/>Your reply to the <rs>Senators</rs>, through <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0059.00548.02050" reg="nearbymention:Holt,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName>, declares it to be your sole object <quote>to act strictly on the defensive, and to authorize no movement against <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> unless justified by a hostile movement on their part,</quote> yet, in reply to the proposition of the <rs>Senators</rs> that no reenforcements should be sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, provided <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> agrees that during the same period no attack should be made, you say: <quote>It is impossible for me (your <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>) to give you (the <rs>Senators</rs>) any such assurance,</quote> that it <quote>would be a manifest violation of his (your) duty to place himself (yourself) under engagements that he (you) would not perform the duty either for an indefinite or a limited period.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7208"/></p> 
<p>In your message of the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="28">28th inst.</day></dateStruct>, in expressing yourself in regard to a similar <pb id="p.549" n="549"/> proposition, you say: <quote>However, strong may be my desire to enter into such an agreement, I am convinced that I do not possess the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7209"/>Congress, and Congress alone, under the war-making power, can exercise the discretion of agreeing to abstain from any and all acts calculated to produce a collision of arms' between this and other governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7210"/>It would, therefore, be a usurpation for the <rs>Executive</rs> to attempt to restrain their hands by an agreement in regard to matters over which he has no constitutional control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7211"/>If he were thus to act, they might pass laws which he should be bound to obey, though in conflict with his agreement.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7212"/>The proposition, it is suggested, was addressed to you under the laws as they now are, and was not intended to refer to a new condition of things arising under new legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7213"/>It was addressed to the <rs>Executive</rs> discretion, acting under existing laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7214"/>If Congress should, under the war-making power, or in any other way, legislate in a manner to affect the peace of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, her interests or her rights, it would not be accomplished in secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7215"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would have timely notice, and she would, I trust, endeavor to meet the emergency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7216"/>It is added in the letter of <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0059.00549.02051" reg="nearbymention:Holt,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName> that <quote>at the present moment it is not deemed necessary to reenforce <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0059.00549.02052" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, because he makes no such request, and feels quite secure in his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7217"/>But, should his safety require it, every effort will be made to supply reenforcements.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7218"/>This would seem to ignore the other branch of the proposition made by the <rs>Senator</rs>, viz., that no attack was to be made on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> during the period suggested, and that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n0125.0059.00549.02053" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> should enjoy the facilities of communication, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7219"/>I advert to this point, however, for the purpose of saying that to send reenforcements to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> could not serve as a means of <hi rend="italics">protecting</hi> and <hi rend="italics">preserving</hi> property, for, as must be known to your Government, it would inevitably lead to immediate hostilities, in which property on all sides would necessarily suffer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7220"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has every disposition to preserve the public peace, and feels, I am sure, in full force, those high <quote>Christian and moral duties</quote> referred to by your <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>; and it is submitted that on her part there is scarcely any consideration of mere property, apart from honor and safety, which could induce her to do aught to jeopard that peace, still less to inaugurate a protracted and bloody civil war. She rests her position on something higher than mere property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7221"/>It is a consideration of her own dignity as a sovereign, and the safety of her people, which prompts her to demand that this property should not longer be used as a military post by a Government she no longer acknowledges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7222"/>She feels this to be an imperative duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7223"/>It has, in fact, become an absolute necessity of her condition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7224"/>Repudiating, as you do, the idea of coercion, avowing peaceful intentions, and expressing a patriot's horror for civil war and bloody strife among those who once were brethren, it is hoped that on further consideration you will not, on a mere question of property, refuse the reasonable demand of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, which honor and necessity alike compel her to vindicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7225"/>Should you disappoint this hope, the responsibility for the result surely does not rest with her. If the evils of war are to be encountered, especially the calamities of civil war, an elevated statesmanship would seem to require that it should be accepted as the unavoidable alternative of something still more disastrous, such as national dishonor or measures materially affecting the safety or permanent interests of a people &mdash;that it should be a choice deliberately made, and entered upon as war, and of <pb id="p.550" n="550"/> set purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7226"/>But that war should be the incident or accident, attendant on a policy professedly peaceful, and not required to effect the object which is avowed as the only end intended, can only be excused when there has been no warning given as to the consequences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7227"/>I am further instructed to say that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> can not, by her silence, appear to acquiesce in the imputation that she was guilty of an act of unprovoked aggression in firing on the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7228"/>Though an unarmed vessel, she was filled with armed men entering her territory against her will, with the purpose of reinforcing a garrison held, within her limits, against her protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7229"/>She forbears to recriminate by discussing the question of the propriety of attempting such a reenforcement at all, as well as of the disguised and secret manner in which it was intended to be effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7230"/>And on this occasion she will say nothing as to the manner in which <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was taken into the possession of its present occupants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7231"/>The interposition of the <rs>Senators</rs> who have addressed you was a circumstance unexpected by my government, and unsolicited certainly by me. The Governor, while he appreciates the high and generous motives by which they were prompted, and while he fully approves the delay which, in deference to them, has taken place in the presentation of this demand, feels that it can not longer be withheld.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7232"/>I conclude with an extract from the instructions just received by me from the government of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7233"/>The letter of the <rs>President</rs>, through <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n0125.0059.00550.02054" reg="nearbymention:Holt,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName>, may be received as the reply to the question you were instructed to ask, as to his assertion of his right to send reenforcements to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7234"/>You were instructed to say to him, if he asserted that right, that the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> regarded such a right when asserted, or with an attempt at its exercise, as a declaration of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7235"/>If the <rs>President</rs> intends it shall not be so understood, it is proper, to avoid any misconception hereafter, that he should be informed of the manner in which the <rs>Governor</rs> will feel bound to regard it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7236"/>If the <rs>President</rs>, when you have stated the reasons which prompt the <rs>Governor</rs> in making the demand for the delivery of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, shall refuse to deliver the fort upon the pledge you have been authorized to make, you will communicate that refusal without delay to the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7237"/>If the <rs>President</rs> shall not be prepared to give you an immediate answer, you will communicate to him that his answer may be transmitted within a reasonable time to the <rs>Governor</rs> at this place (<placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, South Carolina</placeName>).</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7488"/>In that memorandum you correctly state the purport of the official note addressed to you by the undersigned on the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th ultimo</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7489"/>Without repeating the contents of that note in full, it is enough to say here that its object was to invite the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to a friendly consideration of the relations between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <num value="7">seven</num> States lately the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, but now separated from it by the sovereign will of their people, growing out of the pregnant and undeniable fact that those people have rejected the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and established a government of their own. Those relations had to be friendly or hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7490"/>The people of the old and new Governments, occupying contiguous territories, had to stand to each other in the relation of good neighbors, each seeking their happiness and pursuing their national destinies in their own way, without interference with the other; or they had to be rival and hostile nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7491"/>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had no hesitation in electing its choice in this alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7492"/>Frankly and unreservedly, seeking the good of the people who had intrusted them with power, in the spirit of humanity, of the <rs>Christian</rs> civilization of the age, and of that Americanism which regards the true welfare and happiness of the people, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, among its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts, commissioned the undersigned to approach the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with the olive-branch of peace, and to offer to adjust the great questions pending between them in the only way to be justified by the consciences and common sense of good men who had nothing but the welfare of the people of the <num value="2">two</num> confederacies at heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7493"/>Your Government has not chosen to meet the undersigned in the conciliatory and peaceful spirit in which they are commissioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7494"/>Persistently wedded to those fatal theories of construction of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> always rejected by the statesmen of the <rs>South</rs>, and adhered to by those of the <rs type="place">Administration school</rs>, until they have produced their natural and often predicted result of the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, under which we might have continued to live happily and gloriously together, had the spirit of the ancestry who framed the common Constitution animated the hearts of all their sons, you now, with a persistence untaught and uncured by the ruin which has been wrought, refuse to recognize the great fact presented to you of a completed and successful revolution; you close your eyes to the existence of the <rs>Government</rs> founded upon it, and ignore the high duties of moderation and humanity which attach to you in dealing with this great fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7495"/>Had you met these issues with the frankness and manliness with which the undersigned were instructed to present them to you and treat them, the undersigned had not now the melancholy duty to return home and tell their Government and their countrymen that their earnest and ceaseless efforts in behalf of peace had been futile, and that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> meant to <pb id="p.587" n="587"/> subjugate them by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7496"/>Whatever may be the result, impartial history will record the innocence of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and place the responsibility of the blood and mourning that may ensue upon those who have denied the great fundamental doctrine of American liberty, that <quote>governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,</quote> and who have set naval and land armaments in motion to subject the people of <num value="1">one</num> portion of this land to the will of another portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7497"/>That that can never be done, while a freeman survives in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to wield a weapon, the undersigned appeal to past history to prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7498"/>These military demonstrations against the people of the seceded States are certainly far from being in keeping and consistency with the theory of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, maintained in his memorandum, that these States are still component parts of the late <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, as the undersigned are not aware of any constitutional power in the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to levy war, without the consent of Congress, upon a foreign people, much less upon any portion of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7499"/>The undersigned, like the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, have no purpose to <quote>invite or engage in discussion</quote> of the subject on which their <num value="2">two</num> Governments are so irreconcilably at variance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7500"/>It is this variance that has broken up the old Union, the disintegration of which has only begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7501"/>It is proper, however, to advise you that it were well to dismiss the hopes you seem to entertain that, by any of the modes indicated the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will ever be brought to submit to the authority of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7502"/>You are dealing with delusions, too, when you seek to separate our people from our Government, and to characterize the deliberate sovereign act of that people as a <quote>perversion of a temporary and partisan excitement.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7503"/>If you cherish these dreams, you will be awakened from them and find them as unreal and unsubstantial as others in which you have recently indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7504"/>The undersigned would omit the performance of an obvious duty, were they to fail to make known to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have declared their independence with a full knowledge of all the responsibilities of that act, and with as firm a determination to maintain it by all the means with which nature has endowed them as that which sustained their fathers when they threw off the authority of the <rs>British Crown</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7505"/>The undersigned clearly understand that you have declined to appoint a day to enable them to lay the objects of the mission with which they are charged before the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, because so to do would be to recognize the independence and separate nationality of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7506"/>This is the vein of thought that pervades the memorandum before us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7508"/>Your refusal to entertain these overtures for a peaceful solution, the active naval and military preparations of this Government, and a formal notice to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs> of the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> that the <rs>President</rs> intends to provision <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by forcible means, if necessary, are viewed by the undersigned, and can only be received by the world, as a declaration of war against the <pb id="p.588" n="588"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; for the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> knows that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> can not be provisioned without the effusion of blood.
