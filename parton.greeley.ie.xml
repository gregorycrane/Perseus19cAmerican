<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The village of <placeName reg="Amherst, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013296">Amherst</placeName> is a pleasant place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Seen from the summit of a distant hill, it is a white dot in the middle of a level plain, encircled by cultivated and gently-sloping hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>On a nearer approach the traveler perceives that it is a cluster of white houses, looking as if they had alighted among the trees and might take to wing again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>On entering it he finds himself in a very pretty village, built round an ample green and shaded by lofty trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It contains <num value="3">three</num> churches, a printing-office, a court-house, a jail, a tavern, half a dozen stores, an exceedingly minute watchmaker's shop, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> private houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>There is not a human being to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the twittering of birds overhead, and the distant whistle of a locomotive, which in those remote regions seems to make the silence audible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The utter silence and the deserted aspect of the older villages in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> are remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In the morning and evening there is some appearance of life in <placeName reg="Amherst, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013296">Amherst</placeName>; but in the hours of the day when the men are at work, the women busy with their household affairs, and the children at school, the visitor may sit at the window <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> of the village tavern for an hour at a time and not see a living creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Occasionally a pedler, with sleigh bells round his horse, goes Jingling by. Occasionally a farmer's wagon drives up to <num value="1">one</num> of the stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Occasionally a stage, rocking in its leather suspenders, stops at the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> for a moment, and then rocks away again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Occasionally a doctor passes in a very antiquated gig. Occasionally a cock crows, as though he were tired of the dead silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Within and without, it was destitute of anything ornamental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It was not enclosed by a fence; it was not shaded by a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The sun in summer, the winds in winter, had their will of it: there was nothing to avert the fury of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The log school-houses of the previous generation were picturesque and comfortable; those of the present time are as prim, neat, and orderly (and as elegant sometimes) as the cottage of an old maid who enjoys an annuity; but the school-house of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago had an aspect singularly forlorn and uninviting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It was built for an average of <num value="30">thirty</num> pupils, but it frequently contained <num value="50">fifty</num>; and then the little school-room was a compact mass of young humanity: the teacher had to dispense with his table, and was lucky if he could find room for his chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The boys, and the girls too, came tumbling in, rosy and glowing, from their snowballing and sledding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing done in school was reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Those who were not in the class reading, were employed, or were supposed to be employed, in ciphering or writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>When they wanted to write, they went to the teacher with their writing-book and pen, and he set a copy,&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">Procrastination is the thief of time,</q> <q direct="unspecified">Contentment is a virtue,</q> or some other wise saw,&mdash;and mended the pen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>In this rude way the last generation of children learned to read, write, and cipher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>But they learned something more in those rude school-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>They learned obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They were tamed and disciplined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The means employed were extremely unscientific, but the thing was <hi rend="italics">done</hi>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>These <num value="2">two</num> implements were plied vigorously and often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Girls got their full share of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Girls old enough to be wives were no more exempt than the young men old enough to marry them, who sat on the other side of the schoolroom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>It was thought, that if a youth of either sex was not too old to do wrong, neither he nor she was too old to suffer the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>In some districts, a teacher was valued in proportion to his severity; and if he were backward in applying the ferule and the <q direct="unspecified">gad,</q> the parents soon began to be uneasy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>They thought he had no energy, and inferred that the children could not be learning much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In the district schools, then, of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, all the pupils learned to read and to obey; most of them learned to write; many acquired a competent knowledge of figures; a few learned the rudiments of grammar; and if any learned more than these, it was generally due to their unassisted and unencouraged exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>There were no school-libraries at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The teachers usually possessed little general information, and the little they did possess was not often made to contribute to the mental nourishment of their pupils.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> benches of the <rs type="place">Londonderry school</rs> house, near the fire, we may imagine the little white-headed fellow, whom everybody liked, to be seated during the winter of <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">15</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>He <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> was eager to go to school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>When the snow lay on the ground in drifts too deep for him to wade through, <num value="1">one</num> of his aunts, who still lives to tell the story, would take him up on her shoulders and carry him to the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>He was the possessor that winter, of <num value="3">three</num> books, the <q direct="unspecified">Columbian Orator,</q> <persName n="Morse,,,,," id="n0218.0003.00042.00108" reg="mostcommon:Morse,nomatch:0"><surname>Morse</surname></persName>'s Geography, and a spelling book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>From the <rs>Columbian Orator</rs>, he learned many pieces by heart, and among others, that very celebrated oration which, probably the majority of the inhabitants of this nation have at some period of their lives been able to repeat, beginning, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>He had a lisping, whining little voice, says my informant, but spoke with the utmost confidence, and greatly to the amusement of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>He spoke the piece so often in public and private, as to become, as it were, identified with it, as a man who knows <num value="1">one</num> song, suggests that song by his presence, and is called upon to sing it wherever he goes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It is a pity that no <num value="1">one</num> thinks of the vast importance of those <q direct="unspecified">Orators</q> and reading books which the children read and wear out in reading, learning parts of them by heart, and repeating them over and over, till they become fixed in the memory and embedded in the character forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>And it is a pity that those books should contain so much false sentiment, inflated language, Buncombe oratory, and other trash, as they generally do!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>To compile a series of Reading Books for the common schools of this country, were a task for a conclave of the wisest and best men and women that ever lived; a task worthy of them, both from its difficulty and the incalculable extent of its possible results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Spelling was the passion of the little orator during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> winters of his attendance at school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He spelt incessantly in school and out of school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>He would lie on the floor at his grandfather's house, for hours at a time, spelling hard words, all that he could find in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and the few other books within his reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It was the <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> standing amusement of the family to try and puzzle the boy with words, and no <num value="1">one</num> remembers succeeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Spelling, moreover, was <num value="1">one</num> of the great points of the district schools in those days, and he who could out-spell, or, as the phrase was, <q direct="unspecified">spell down</q> the whole school, ranked <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> oily to him who surpassed the rest in arithmetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Those were the palmy days of the spelling-school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The pupils assembled once a week, voluntarily, at the school-house, chose <q direct="unspecified">sides,</q> and contended with <num value="1">one</num> another long and earnestly for the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>He is well remembered by his companions in orthography.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>They delight still to tell of the little fellow, in the long evenings, falling asleep in his place, and when it came his turn, his neighbors gave him an anxious nudge, and he would wake instantly, spell off his word, and drop asleep again in a moment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>I will state as nearly as possible in their own words, what his school-fellows there remember of him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/><num value="1">One</num> of them can just recall him as a very small boy with a head as white as snow, who <q direct="unspecified">was almost always up head in his class, and took it so much to heart when he did happen to lose his place, that he would cry bitterly; so that some boys when they had gained the right to get above him, declined the honor, because it hurt <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s feelings so.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>He was the pet of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Those whom he used to excel most signally liked him as well as the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>He was an active, bright, eager boy, but not fond of play, and seldom took part in the sports of the other boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/><num value="1">One</num> muster day, this informant remembers, the clergyman of <placeName reg="Londonderry, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063568">Londonderry</placeName>, who had heard glowing accounts of <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s feats at school, took him on his lap in the field, questioned him a long time, tried to puzzle him with hard words, and concluded by saying with strong emphasis to <num value="1">one</num> of the boy's relatives, <q direct="unspecified">Mark my words, <persName n="Woodburn,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0003.00043.00110" reg="nearbymention:Woodburn,David,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Woodburn</surname></persName>, that boy was not made for nothing.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/></p> 
<p>Another, besides confirming the above, adds, that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was in some respects exceedingly brave, and in others exceedingly tim <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> orous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>He was never afraid of the dark, could not be frightened by ghost-stories, never was abashed in speaking or reciting, was not to be overawed by supposed superiority of knowledge or rank, would talk up to the teacher and question his decision with perfect freedom, though never in a spirit of impertinence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Yet he could not stand up to a boy and fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>When attacked, he would neither fight nor run away, but <q direct="unspecified">stand still and take it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>His ear was so delicately constructed that any loud noise like the report of a gun would almost throw him into convulsions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>If a gun were about to be discharged, he would either run away as fast as his slender legs carry him, or else would throw himself upon the ground and stuff grass into his ears to deaden the dreadful noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, when the people of <placeName reg="Londonderry, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063568">Londonderry</placeName> inflamed their patriotism by a copious consumption of gunpowder, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> would run into the woods to get beyond the sound of the cannons and pistols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It was at <placeName reg="Londonderry, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063568">Londonderry</placeName>, and about his <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> year, that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> began the habit of reading or book-devouring, which he never lost during all the years of his boyhood, youth, and apprenticeship, and relinquished only when he entered that most exacting of all professions, the editorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The gentleman whose reminiscences I am now recording, tells me that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> in his <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> and <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> years, would lie under a tree on his face, reading hour after hour, completely absorbed in his book; and <q direct="unspecified">if no <num value="1">one</num> stumbled over him or stirred him up,</q> would read on, unmindful of dinner time and sun-set, as long as he could see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>I think I attended school with <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0003.00045.00111" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> <num value="2">two</num> summers and <num value="2">two</num> winters, but have no recollection of seeing him except at the school-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He was an exceedingly mild, quiet and inoffensive child, entirely devoted to his books at school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It used to be said in the neighborhood, that he was the same out of school, and that his parents were obliged to secrete his books to prevent his injuring himself by over study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>His devotion to his books, together with the fact of his great advancement beyond others of his age in the few studies then pursued in the district school, rendered him notorious in that part of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>He was regarded as a prodigy, and his name was a household world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He was looked upon as standing alone, and entirely unapproachable by any of the little mortals around him. Reading, parsing, and spelling, are the only branches of learning which I remember him in, or in connection with which his name was at that time mentioned, though he might have given some attention to writing and arithmetic, which completed the circle of studies in the district school at that time; but in the <num value="3">three</num> branches <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> named he excelled all, even in the winter school, which was attended by several young men and women, some of whom became teachers soon after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Though mild and quiet he was ambitious in the school; to be at the head of his class, and be accounted the best scholar in school, seemed to be prominent objects with him, and to furnish strong motives to effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>I can recall but <num value="1">one</num> instance of his missing a word in the spelling class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The classes went on to the floor to spell, and he almost invariably stood at the head of the <quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class,</quote> embracing the most advanced scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He stood there at the time referred to, and by missing a word, lost his place, which so grieved him that he wept like a punished child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>While I knew him he did not engage with other children in the usual recreations and amusements of the school grounds; as soon as the school was dismissed at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, he would start for home, a distance of halt a mile, with all his books under his arm, including the New Testament, <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0218.0003.00045.00112" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s <persName n="Book,,Spelling,,," id="n0218.0003.00045.00113" reg="default:Book,Spelling,,,"><foreName>Spelling</foreName> <surname>Book</surname></persName>, <persName n="Reader,,English,,," id="n0218.0003.00045.00114" reg="default:Reader,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Reader</surname></persName>, &amp;c., and would not return till the last moment of intermission; at least such was his practice in the summer time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>With regard to his aptness in spelling, it used to be said that the minister of the town, <persName n="McGregor,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n0218.0003.00045.00115" reg="mostcommon:McGregor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev.

I always supposed, however, that this was an exaggeration, for he could not have been more than <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> old at the time this was told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>My father soon after removed to another town <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles distant</measure>, and I lost sight of the family entirely, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> and all, though I always remembered the gentle, flaxen-haired schoolmate with much interest, and often wondered what became of him; and when the <quote><persName n="Cabin,,Log,,," id="n0218.0003.00046.00116" reg="default:Cabin,Log,,,"><foreName>Log</foreName> <surname>Cabin</surname></persName></quote> appeared, I took much pains to assure myself whether this <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0003.00046.00117" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> was the same little <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> grown up, and found it was.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>From his <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> year, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> resided chiefly at his father's house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>He was now old enough to walk to the nearest school-house, a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>He could read fluently, spell any word in the language; had some knowledge of geography, and a little of arithmetic; had read the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> through from Genesis to Revelations; had read the <rs>Pilgrim</rs>'s Progress with intense interest, and dipped into every other book he could lay his hands on. From his <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> to his <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> year, he lived, worked, read and went to school, in <placeName reg="Amherst, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063221">Amherst</placeName> and the adjoining town of <placeName reg="Bedford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049378">Bedford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Those who were then his neighbors and schoolmates there, have a lively recollection of the boy and his ways.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Henceforth, he went to school only in the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Again he attended a school which he had no right to attend, that of <persName n="Bedford,,,,," id="n0218.0003.00046.00118" reg="mostcommon:Bedford,nomatch:0"><surname>Bedford</surname></persName>, and his attendance was not merely permitted, but sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school-committee</orgName> expressly voted, that no pupils from other towns should be received at their school, <hi rend="italics">except <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0003.00046.00119" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> alone</hi>; and, on entering the school, he took his place, young as he was, at the head of it, as it were, by acclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Nor did his superiority ever excite envy or enmity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>He bore his honors meekly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> liked the boy, and took pride in his superiority to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>All his schoolmates agree in this, that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> never had an enemy at school.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The snow lies deep on those <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> hills in the winter, and presents a serious obstacle to the younger children in their way to the school-house; nor is it the rarest of disasters, even now, for children to be lost in a drift, and frozen to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>(Such a calamity happened <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, within a mile or <num value="2">two</num> of the old <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0218.0003.00046.00120" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> homestead.) <q direct="unspecified">Many a morning,</q> says <num value="1">one</num> of the neighbors&mdash; then a stout schoolboy, now a sturdy farmer&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">many a morning I <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> have carried <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> on my back through the drifts to school, and put my own mittens over his, to keep his little hands from freezing.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>He adds, <q direct="unspecified">I lived at the next house, and I and my brothers often went down in the evening to play with him; but he never would play with us till he had got his lessons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>We could neither coax nor force him to.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>His fondness for reading grew with the growth of his mind, till it amounted to a passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>His father's stock of books was small indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It consisted of a Bible, a <q direct="unspecified">Confession of Faith,</q> and perhaps, all told, <num value="20">twenty</num> volumes beside; and they by no means of a kind calculated to foster a love of reading in the mind of a little boy. But a <hi rend="italics">weekly newspaper</hi> came to the house from the village of <placeName reg="Amherst, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063221">Amherst</placeName>; and, except his mother's tales, that newspaper probably bad more to do with the opening of the boy's mind and the tendency of his opinions, than anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The family well remember the eagerness with which he anticipated its coming.&lt;*&gt; per-day was the brightest of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>An hour before the post-rider was expected, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> would walk down the road to meet him, bent on having the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <hi rend="italics">read</hi>; and when he had got possession of the precious sheet, he would hurry with it to some secluded place, lie down on the grass, and greedily devour its contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The paper was called (and is still) the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Farmers Cabinet" type="newspaper">Farmer's Cabinet</orgName></hi>. It was mildly Whig in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The selections were religious, agricultural, and miscellaneous; the editorials few, brief, and amiable; its summary of news scanty in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>But it was the <hi rend="italics">only</hi> bearer of tidings from the <name>Great World</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>It connected the little brown house on the rocky hill of <placeName reg="Amherst, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063221">Amherst</placeName> with the general life of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> scoured the country for books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Books were books in that remote and secluded region; and when he had exhausted the collections of the neighbors, he carried the search into the neighboring towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I am assured that there was not <num value="1">one</num> readable book within <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> of his father's house, which <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> did not borrow and read during his residence in <placeName reg="Amherst, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063221">Amherst</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>He was never without a book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>As soon, says <num value="1">one</num> of his sisters, as he was dressed in the morning, he flew to his book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>He read every minute of the day which he could snatch from his studies at school, and on the farm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>He would be so absorbed in his reading, that when his parents required his services, it was like rousing a heavy sleeper from his deepest sleep, to awaken <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> to a sense of things around him and an apprehension of the duty required of him. And even then he clung to his book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>He would go reading to the cellar and the cider-barrel, reading to the wood-pile, reading to the garden, reading to the neighbors; and pocketing his book only long enough to perform his errand, he would fall to reading again the instant his mind and his hands were at liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>He kept in a secure place an ample supply of pine knots, and as soon as it was dark he would light <num value="1">one</num> of these cheap and brilliant illuminators, put it on the back-log in the spacious fire-place, pile up his school books and his reading books on the floor, lie down on his back on the hearth, with his head to the fire and his feet coiled away out of the reach of stumblers; and there he would lie and read all through the long winter evenings, silent, motionless, dead <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> to the world around him, alive only to the world to which he was transported by his book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Visitors would come in, chat a while, and go away, without knowing he was present, and without his being aware of their coming and going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It was a nightly struggle to get him to bed. His father required his services early in the morning, and was therefore desirous that he should go to bed early in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>He feared, also, for the eye-sight of the boy, reading so many hours with his head in the fire and by the flaring, flickering light of a pine knot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>And so, by <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, his father would <hi rend="italics">begin</hi> the task of recalling the absent mind from its roving, and rousing the prostrate and dormant body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>And when <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> at length had been forced to beat a retreat, he kept his younger brother awake by telling over to him in bed what he had read, and by reciting the school lessons of the next day. His brother was by no means of a literary turn, and was prone&mdash;much to the chagrin of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>&mdash;to fall asleep long before the lessons were all said and the tales all told.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>So entire and passionate a devotion to the acquisition of knowledge in <num value="1">one</num> so young, would be remarkable in any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>But when the situation of the boy is considered&mdash;living in a remote And very rural district&mdash;few books accessible&mdash;few literary persons residing near&mdash;the school contributing scarcely anything to his mental nourishment&mdash;no other boy in the neighborhood manifesting any particular interest in learning&mdash;the people about him all engaged in a rude and hard struggle to extract the means of subsistence from a rough and rocky soil&mdash;such an intense, absorbing, and persistent love of knowledge as that exhibited by <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0003.00049.00123" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, must be accounted very extraordinary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>That his neighbors so accounted it, they are still eager to attest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Continually the wonder grew, that <num value="1">one</num> small head should carry all he knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>There were not wanting those who thought that superior means of instruction ought to be placed within the reach of so superior a child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>I have a somewhat vague, but very positive, and fully confirmed story, of a young man just returned from college to his father's house in <placeName reg="Bedford, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063240">Bedford</placeName>, who fell in with <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, and was so struck with his capacity and attainments that he offered to send him to an academy in a neighboring town, and bear all the expenses <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> of his maintenance and tuition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>But his mother could not let him go, his father needed his assistance at home, and the boy himself is said not to have favored the scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>A wise, a fortunate choice, I cannot help believing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>That academy <hi rend="italics">may</hi> have been an institution where boys received more good than harm&mdash;where real <hi rend="italics">knowledge</hi> was imparted&mdash;where souls were inspired with the love of high and good things, and inflamed with an ambition to run a high and good career&mdash;where boys did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> lose all their modesty and half their sense&mdash;where chests were expanded&mdash;where cheeks were ruddy&mdash;where limbs were active&mdash;where stomachs were peptic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>It <hi rend="italics">may</hi> have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>But if it was, it was a different academy from many whose praises are in all the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It was better not to run the risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>If that young man's offer had been accepted, it is a question whether the world would have ever heard of <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0003.00050.00124" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Probably his fragile body would not have sustained the brain-stimulating treatment which a forward and eager boy generally receives at an academy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>A better friend, though not a better meaning <num value="1">one</num>, was a jovial neighbor, a sea-captain, who had taken to farming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>The captain had seen the world, posessed the yarn-spinning faculty, and besides, being himself a walking traveller's library, had a considerable collection of books, which he freely lent to <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>His salute, on meeting the boy, was not <quote>How do you do, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>or, <quote>How do you spell Encyclopedia, or Kamtschatka, or Nebuchadnezzar?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The old gentleman used to question the boy upon the contents of the books he had lent him, and was again and again surprised at the fluency, the accuracy, and the fullness of his replies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The captain was of service to <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> in various ways, and he is remembered by the family with gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>To <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s brother he once gave a sheep and a load of hay to keep it on during the winter, thus adapting his benefactions to the various tastes of his juvenile friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>A clergyman, too, is spoken of, who took great interest in <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, and gave him instruction in grammar, often giving the boy erroneous information to test his knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, he used to say, could never be shaken on a point which he had once clearly understood, but would stand to his opinion, and defend it against anybody and everybody&mdash;teacher, pastor, or public opinion.

<p>In <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, the sons of farmers begin to make themselves useful almost as soon as they can walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>They feed the chickens, they drive the cows, they bring in wood and water, and soon come to perform all those offices which come under the denomiation of <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">chores</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>By the time they are <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> old, they frequently have tasks assigned them, which are called <q direct="unspecified">stints,</q> and not till they have done their stint are they at liberty to play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The reader may think that <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s devotion to literature would naturally enough render the farm work distasteful to him; and if he had gone to the academy, it might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>I am bound, however, to say that all who knew him in boyhood, agree that he was not more devoted to study in his leisure hours, than he was faithful and assiduous in performing his duty to his father during the hours of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/><hi rend="italics">Faithful</hi> is the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>He could be <hi rend="italics">trusted</hi> any where, and to do anything within the compass of his strength and years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>It was hard, sometimes, to rouse him from his books; but when he had been roused, and was entrusted with an errand or a piece of work, he would set about it vigorously and lose no time till it was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/><q direct="unspecified">Come,</q> his brother would say sometimes, when the father had set the boys a task and had gone from home; <q direct="unspecified">come, Hod, let's go fishing.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/></p> 
<p>Fishing, it appears, was the only sport in which <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> took much pleasure, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>But his love of fishing did not originate in what the <name>Germans</name> call the <q direct="unspecified">sport impulse.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Other boys fished for sport; <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> fished for fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>He fished <hi rend="italics">industriously</hi>, keeping his eyes unceasingly on the float, and never distracting his own attention, or that of the fish, by conversing with his companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The consequence was that he would often catch more than all the rest of the party put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Shooting was the favorite amusement of the boys of the neighborhood, but <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> could rarely be persuaded to take part in it. When he did accompany a shooting-party, he would never carry or discharge a gun, and when the game was found he would lie down and stop his ears till the murder had been done. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>It began to gather when the boy was little more than <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old. In his <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> year it broke, and drove the family, for a time, from house and land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>In his <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num>, it had completed its work&mdash;his father was a ruined man, an exile, a fugitive from his native State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>In those days, before the great manufacturing towns which now afford the farmer a market for his produce had sprung into existence along the shores of the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, before a net-work of railroads regulated the price of grain in the barns of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> by the standard of <placeName reg="Mark Lane">Mark Lane</placeName>, a farmer of <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> was not, in his best estate, <hi rend="italics">very</hi> far from ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Some articles which <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, were quite destitute of pecuniary value, now afford an ample profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Fire-wood, for example, when <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0004.00052.00125" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> was a boy, could seldom be sold at any price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>It was usually burned up on the land on which it grew, as a worthless incumbrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Fire-wood now, in the city of <placeName reg="Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013989">Manchester</placeName>, sells for <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">six dollars</measure> a cord, and at any point within <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013989">Manchester</placeName></placeName> for <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure>. <measure n="40years" type="date">Forty years</measure> ago, farmers had little surplus produce, and that little had to be carried far, and it brought little money home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>In short, before the manufacturing system was introduced into <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, affording employment to her daughters in the factory, to her sons on the land, <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> was a poverty-stricken State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>But man the partisan, like man the sectarian, is, always was, and will ever be, a poor creature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The way to thrive in <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> was to work very hard, keep the store-bill small, stick to the farm, and be no man's security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Those, too, were the jolly, bad days, when everybody drank strong drinks, and no <num value="1">one</num> supposed that the affairs of life could possibly be transacted without its agency, any more than a machine could <hi rend="italics">go</hi> without the lubricating oil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>No holiday could be celebrated without drinking-booths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>At weddings, at christenings, at funerals, rum seemed to be the inducement that brought, and the tie that bound, the company together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It was rum that cemented friendship, and rum that clinched bargains; rum that kept out the cold of winter, and rum that moderated the summer's heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Men drank it, women drank it, children drank it. There were families in which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty of every morning was to serve around to all its members, even to the youngest child, a certain portion of alcoholic liquor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>Rum had to be bought with money, and money was hard to get in <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>At his house and on his farm the jug was never empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> had a vague idea that the men had come to rob them of all they possessed; and wild stories are afloat in the neighborhood, of the boy's conduct on the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Others assert, that the article carried off by the indignant boy was not dresses, but a gallon of rum. But whatever the boy did, or left undone, the reader may imagine that it was to all the family a day of confusion, anguish, and horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>The mother's spirit never flagged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Her voice rose in song and laughter from the tangled brush-wood in which she was often buried; and no word, discordant or unkind, was ever known to break the perfect harmony, to interrupt the perfect good humor that prevailed in the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>At night, they went home to the most primitive of suppers, and partook of it in the picturesque and labor-saving style in which the dinner before alluded to was consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he got into a scrape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>He had broken some petty rule of the school, and was required, as a punishment, to inflict a certain number of blows upon another boy, who had, I think, been a participator in the offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The boy delighted to render suck assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>However deeply he might be absorbed in his own studies, as soon as he saw a puzzled countenance peering in at the door, he knew his man, knew what was wanted; and would jump up from his recumbent posture in the chimney-corner, and proceed, with a patience that is still gratefully remembered, with a perspicuity that is still mentioned with admiration, to impart the information required of him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>There was a new reason wily they should; for a candle was a luxury now, too expensive to be indulged in. <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s home was a favorite evening resort for the children of the neighborhood&mdash;a fact which says much for the kindly spirit of its inmates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>They came <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> to hear his mother's songs and stories, to play with his brother and sisters, to get assistance from himself; and they liked to be there, where there was no stiffness, nor ceremony, nor discord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> cared nothing for their noise and romping, but he could never be induced to join in an active game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>When he was not assisting some bewildered arithmetician, he lay in the old position, on his back in the fireplace, reading, always reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The boys would hide his book, but he would get another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>They would pull him out of his fiery den by the leg; and he would crawl back, without the least show of anger, but without the slightest inclination to yield the point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>There was a game, however, which could sometimes tempt him from his book, and of which he gradually became excessively fond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>It was draughts, or <quote>checkers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>In that game he acquired extraordinary skill, beating everybody in the neighborhood; and before he had reached maturity, there were few draught-players in the country&mdash;if any&mdash;who could win <num value="2">two</num> games in <num value="3">three</num> of <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0005.00062.00139" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>His cronies at <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName> seem to have been those who were fond of draughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>In his passion for books, he was alone among his companions, who attributed his continual reading more to indolence than to his acknowledged superiority of intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>It was often predicted that, whoever else might prosper, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> never would.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>And yet, he gave proof, in very early life, that the <rs>Yankee</rs> element was strong within him. In the first place, he was always <hi rend="italics">doing</hi> something; and, in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, he always had something to <hi rend="italics">sell</hi>. He saved nuts, and exchanged them at the store for the articles he wished to purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>He would hack away, hours at a time, at a pitch-pine stump, the roots of which are as inflammable as pitch itself, and, tying up the roots in little bundles, and the little bundles into <num value="1">one</num> large <num value="1">one</num>, he would <q direct="unspecified">back</q> the load to the store, and sell it for kindling wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>His favorite out-door sport, too, at <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName>, was bee-hunting, which is not only an agreeable and exciting pastime, but occasionally rewards the hunter with a prodigious mess of honey&mdash;as much as a <measure n="150l." type="pounds"><num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> pounds</measure> having been frequently obtained from a single tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>This was profitable sport, and <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> liked it amazingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>His share of the honey generally found its way to the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>By these and other expedients, the boy managed always to have a little money and when a pedler came <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> along with books in his wagon, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was pretty sure to be his customer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Yet he was only half a Yankee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>He could earn money, but the bargaining faculty he had not.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>What did he read?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Whatever he could get. But his preference was for history, poetry, and&mdash;newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>He had read, as I have before mentioned, the whole Bible before he was <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> old. He read the <rs>Arabian Nights</rs> with intense pleasure in his <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> year; <persName n="Crusoe,,Robinson,,," id="n0218.0005.00063.00140" reg="default:Crusoe,Robinson,,,"><foreName>Robinson</foreName> <surname>Crusoe</surname></persName> in his <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num>; <persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n0218.0005.00063.00141" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName> in his <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num>; in his <num value="12" type="ordinal">twelfth</num>, <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num>, and <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> years, he read a good many of the common, superficial histories&mdash;Robertson's, <persName n="Goldsmith,,,,," id="n0218.0005.00063.00142" reg="mostcommon:Goldsmith,nomatch:0"><surname>Goldsmith</surname></persName>'s, and others&mdash;and as many tales and romances as he could borrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>At <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName>, as at <placeName reg="Amherst, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013296">Amherst</placeName>, he roamed far and wide in search of, books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>He was fortunate, too, in living near the <quote>mansion-house</quote> before mentioned, the proprietor of which, it appears, took some interest in <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, and, though he would not lend him books, allowed him to come to the house and read there as often and as long as he chose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>A story is told by <num value="1">one</num> who lived at the <quote>mansion-house</quote> when <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> used to read there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> entered the library <num value="1">one</num> day, when the master of the house happened to be present, in conversation with a stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The stranger, struck with the awkwardness, and singular appearance of the boy, took him for little better than an idiot, and was inclined to laugh at the idea of lending books to <quote>such a fellow as <hi rend="italics">that</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The owner of the mansion defended his conduct by extolling the intelligence of his protege, and wound up with the usual climax, that he should <q direct="unspecified">not be surprised, sir, if that boy should come to be <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>People in those days had a high respect for the presidential office, and really believed&mdash;many of them did&mdash;that to get the highest place it was only necessary to be the greatest man. Hence it was a very common mode of praising a boy, to make the safe assertion that he <hi rend="italics">might</hi>, <num value="1">one</num> day, if he persevered in well-doing, be the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>That was before the era of wire-pulling and rotation in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He must be either a very young or a very old man who can <hi rend="italics">now</hi> mention the presidential office in connection with the future of any boy not extraordinarily vicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Wire-pulling, happily, has robbed the schoolmasters of <num value="1">one</num> of their bad arguments for a virtuous life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>But we are wandering from the library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/><pb id="p.64" n="64"/> The end of the story is, that the stranger looked as if he thought <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s defender half mad himself; and, <q direct="unspecified">to tell the truth,</q> said the lady who told me the story, <q direct="unspecified">we all thought Mr.&mdash;&mdash;had made a crazy speech.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> does not appear to have made a favorable impression at the <quote>mansion-house.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>But he read the books in it, for all that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Perhaps it was there, that he fell in with a copy of <persName n="Hemans,Mrs.,,,," id="n0218.0005.00064.00143" reg="mostcommon:Hemans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Hemans</surname></persName>' poems, which, where ever he found them, were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> poems that awakened his enthusiasm, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> writings that made him aware of the better impulses of his nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/></p> 
<p>Such a testimony as this may teach the reader, if he needs the lesson, not to undervalue the authors whom his fastidious taste may place among the <rs>Lesser Lights</rs> of Literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>To you, fastidious reader, those authors may have little to impart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>But among the hills in the country, where the feelings are fresher, and minds are unsated by literary sweets, there may be many a thoughtful boy and earnest man, to whom your Lesser Lights are Suns that warm, illumine, and quicken!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The incidents in <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s life at <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName> were few, and of the few that did occur, several have doubtless been forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>The people there remember him vividly enough, and are profuse in imparting their general impressions of his character; but the facts which gave rise to those impressions have mostly escaped their memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>They speak of him as an <hi rend="italics">absorbed</hi> boy, who rarely saluted or saw a passer-by&mdash;who would walk miles at the road-side, following the zig-zag of the fences, without once looking up&mdash;who was often taken by strangers for a natural fool, but was known by <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> his intimates to be, in the language of <num value="1">one</num> of them&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">a darned smart fellow, in spite of his looks</q>&mdash;who was utterly blameless in all his ways, and works, and words&mdash;who had not, and could not have had, an enemy, because nature, by leaving out of his composition the diabolic element, had made it impossible for him to <hi rend="italics">be</hi> <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>The few occurrences of the boy's life, which, in addition to these general reminiscences of his character, have chanced to escape oblivion, may as well be narrated here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>As an instance of his nervous timidity, a lady mentions; that when he was about <measure n="11years" type="date">eleven years</measure> old, he came to her house <num value="1">one</num> evening on some errand, and staid till after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>He started for home, at length, but had not been gone many minutes before he burst into the house again, in great agitation, saying he had seen a wolf; by the side of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>There had been rumors of wolves in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> declared he had seen the eyes of <num value="1">one</num> glaring upon him as he passed, and he was so overcome with terror, that <num value="2">two</num> of the elder girls of the family accompanied him home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>They saw no wolf, nor were there any&mdash;wolves about at the time; the mistake probably arose from some phosphorescent wood, or some other bright object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>A Vermont boy of that period, as a general thing, cared little more for a wolf than a New York boy does for a cat, and could have faced a pack of wolves with far less dread than a company of strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was never abashed by an audience; but <num value="2">two</num> glaring eye-balls among the brush-wood sent him flying with terror.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>In nothing are mortals more wise than in their fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>That which we stigmatize as cowardice&mdash;what is it but nature's kindly warning to her children, not to confront what they cannot master, and not to undertake what their strength is unequal to <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was a <hi rend="italics">match</hi> for a rustic auditory, and he feared it not. He was not a match for a wild beast; so he ran away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Considerate nature!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, all through his boyhood, kept his object of becoming a printer, steadily in view; and soon after coming to <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, about his <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> year, he began to think it time for him to take a step towards the fulfilment of his intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>He talked to his father on the subject, but received no encouragement from him. His father said, and very truly, that no <num value="1">one</num> would take an apprentice so young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>But the boy was not satisfied; and, <num value="1">one</num> morning, he trudged off to <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> <placeName reg="Seven Springs, Wayne, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076578">Whitehall</placeName>, a town about <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles distant</measure>, where a newspaper was published, to make inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>He went to the printing office, saw the printer, and learned that his father was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>He <hi rend="italics">was</hi> too young, the printer said; and so the boy trudged home again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>A few months after, he went on another and much longer pedestrian expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>He started, with <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure> in his pocket and a small bundle of provisions on a stick over his shoulder, to walk to <placeName reg="Londonderry, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063568">Londonderry</placeName>, a <measure n="120miles" type="distance">hundred and twenty miles distant</measure>, to see his old friends and relatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>He performed the journey, stayed sevral weeks, and came back with a shilling or <num value="2">two</num> more money than he took with him&mdash;owing, we may infer, to the amiable way aunts and uncles have of bestowing small coins upon nephews who visit them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>His re-appearance in <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> excited unbounded astonishment, his age and dimensions seeming ludicrously out of proportion to the length and manner of his solitary journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>He was made much of during his stay, and his journey is still spoken of there as a wonderful performance, only exceeded, in fact, by <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> return to <placeName reg="Londonderry, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063568">Londonderry</placeName> a year or <num value="2">two</num> after, when he drove over the same ground, his aunt and her <num value="4">four</num> children, ill a <quote><num value="1">one</num>&mdash;horse wagon,</quote> and drove back again, without the slightest accident.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>As a set-off to these marvels, it must be recorded, that on <num value="2">two</num> other occasions he was taken for an idiot&mdash;once, when he entered a store, in <num value="1">one</num> of the brownest of his brown studies, and a stranger inquired, <q direct="unspecified">What darn fool is that?</q>&mdash;and a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, in the manner following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>He was accustomed to call his father <q direct="unspecified">Sir,</q> both in speaking to, and speaking of him. <num value="1">One</num> day, while <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was chopping wood by the side of the road, a man came up on horse-back and inquired the way to a distant town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> could not tell him, and, without looking up, said, <q direct="unspecified">ask Sir,</q> meaning, ask father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The stranger, puzzled at this reply, repeated his question; and <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> again said, <q direct="unspecified">ask Sir.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/><q direct="unspecified">I am asking,</q> shouted the man. <q direct="unspecified">Well, ask Sir,</q> said <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/><q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Aint</hi> I asking, you&mdash;fool,</q> screamed the man. <q direct="unspecified">But I want you to ask Sir,</q> said <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>It was of no avail, the man rode away in disgust, and inquired at the next tavern <q direct="unspecified">who that tow-headed fool was down the road.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/></p> 
<p>In a similar absent fit it must have been, that the boy once attempted, <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> in vain, to yoke the oxen that he had yoked a <num value="100">hundred</num> times before without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>To see a small boy yoking a pair of oxen is, O City Reader, to behold an amazing exhibition of the power of Mind over Matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The huge beasts <hi rend="italics">need</hi> not come under the yoke&mdash;<num value="20">twenty</num> men could not compel them&mdash;but they do come under it, at the beck of a boy that can just stagger under the yoke himself and whom <num value="1">one</num> of the oxen, with <num value="1">one</num> horn and a shake of the head, could toss over a; hay-stack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The boy, with the yoke on his shoulders, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <q direct="unspecified">bows</q> in his hand, marches up to the <quote>off</quote> ox, puts the bow round his neck, thrusts the ends of the bow through the holes of the yoke, fastens them there&mdash;and <num value="1">one</num> ox is his. But the other!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The boy then removes the other bow, holds up the end of the yoke, and commands the <quote>near</quote> ox to approach, and <quote>come under here sir.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Wonderful to relate the near ox obeys I He walks slowly up, and takes his place by the side of his brother, as though it were a pleasant thing to pant all day before the plough, and he was only too happy to leave the dull pasture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>But the ox is a creature of habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>If you catch the near ox <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then try to get the off ox to come under the near side of the yoke, you will discover that the off ox has an opinion of his own. He won't come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>This was the mistake which <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> morning in an absent fit, committed, and the off ox could not be brought to deviate from established usage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>After much coaxing, and, possibly, some vituperation, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was about to give it up, when his brother chanced to come to the field, who saw at a glance what was the matter, and rectified the mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/><q direct="unspecified">Ah!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>his father used to say, after <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> had made a display of this kind, <q direct="unspecified">that boy will never get along in this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>He'll never know more than enough to come in when it rains.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/></p> 
<p>Another little story is told of the brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The younger was throwing stones at a pig that preferred to go in a direction exactly contrary to that in which the boys wished to drive him&mdash;a common case with pigs, <hi rend="italics">et ceteri</hi>. <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, who never threw stones at pigs, was overheard to say, <q direct="unspecified">Now, you ought n't to throw stones at that hog; he don't <hi rend="italics">know</hi> anything.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/></p> 
<p>The person who heard these words uttered by the boy, is <num value="1">one</num> of those libulant individuals who, in the rural districts, are called <quote>old soakers,</quote> and his face, tobacco-stained, and rubicund with the <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> drinks of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, gleamed with the light of other days, as he hiccoughed out the little tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>It may serve to show how the boy is remembered in <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName>, if I add a word or <num value="2">two</num> respecting my interview with this man. I met him on an unfrequented road; his hair was gray, his step was tottering; and thinking it probable he might be able to add to my stock of reminiscences, I asked him whether he remembered <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0005.00068.00145" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>He mumbled a few words in reply; but I perceived that he was far gone towards intoxication, and soon drove on. A moment after, I heard a voice calling behind me. I looked round, and discovered that the voice was that of the soaker, who was shouting for me to stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>I alighted and went back to him. And now that the idea of my previous questions had had time to imprint itself upon his half-torpid brain, his tongue was loosened, and he entered into the subject with an enthusiasm that seemed for a time to burn up the fumes that had stupefied him. He was full of his theme; and, besides confirming much that I had already heard, added the story related above, from his own recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>As the tribute of a sot to the champion of the <rs>Maine-Law</rs>, the old man's harangue was highly interesting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>That part of the town of <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName> was, <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, a desperate place for drinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>The hamlet in which the family lived longer than anywhere else in the neighborhood, has ceased to exist, and it decayed principally through the intemperance of its inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Much of the land about it has not been improved in the least degree, from what it was when <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0005.00068.00146" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> helped to clear it; and drink has absorbed the means and the energy which should have been devoted to its improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>A boy growing up in such a place would be likely to become either a drunkard or a tee-totaller, according to his organization; and <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> became the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>It is rather a singular fact, that, though both his parents and all their ancestors were accustomed to the habitual and liberal use of intoxicating liquors and tobacco, neither <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> nor his brother could ever be induced to partake of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>They had a constitutional aversion to the taste of both, long before they understood the nature of the human system well enough to know that stimulants of all kinds are necessarily pernicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>He was nearly strangled in coming into the world; and, in his <num value="13" type="ordinal">thirteenth</num> year, he was nearly strangled out of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Across the river, where it was widened by the dam, there was no bridge, and people were accustomed to get over on a floating saw-log, pushing along the log by means of a pole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>The boys were floating about in the river <num value="1">one</num> day, when the log on which the younger brother was standing, rolled over, and in went the boy, over head and ears, into water deep enough to drown a giraffe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>He rose to the surface and clung to the bark of the log, but was unable to get upon it from the same cause as that which had prevented his standing upon it&mdash;it would roll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> hastened to his assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>He got upon the log to which his brother was clinging, lay down upon it, and put down a hand for his brother to grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Neither of the boys could swim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>They clung to the log and screamed for assistance; but no <num value="1">one</num> happened to be near enough to hear them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>At length, the younger of the drowning pair managed, by climbing over <placeName key="tgn,2399200" n="1.000 1" reg="horace, wayne, ohio">Horace</placeName>, and sousing <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> him completely under the log, to get out. <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> emerged, half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>drowned, and again hung for life at the rough bark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>But the future hero of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> paragraphs was not to be crowned in a millpond; so the log floated into shallower water, when, by making a last, spasmodic effort, he succeeded in springing up high enough to get safely upon its broad back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>It was a narrow escape for both; but <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, with all his reams of articles forming in his head, came as near taking a summary departure to that bourn where no Tribune could have been set up, as a boy could, and yet not <hi rend="italics">go</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>And this was the more remarkable from the fact, that his education at home was not of a nature to direct his attention strongly to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Both of his parents assented to the <name>Orthodox</name> creed of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>; his father inherited a preference for the <rs>Baptist</rs> denomination; his mother a leaning to the <rs>Presbyterian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>And if the mother&mdash;as mothers are apt to be&mdash;was a little less scrupulous upon such points, and occasionally winked at <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> novel-reading, it certainly did not arise from any set disapproval of her husband's strictness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>It was merely that she was the mother, he the father, of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The religious education of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was, in short, of a nature to leave his mind, not unbiased in favor of orthodoxy&mdash;that had been almost impossible in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago&mdash;but as nearly in equilibrium on the subject, in a state as favorable to original inquiry, as the place and circumstances of his early life rendered possible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The boy appears to have shed his orthodoxy easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>His was not a nature to travail with a new idea for months and years, and arrive at certainty only after a struggle that rends the soul, and leaves it sore and sick for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>He was young; the iron of our theological system had not entered into his soul; he took the matter somewhat lightly; and, having arrived at a theory of the <name>Divine</name> government, which accorded with his own gentle and forgiving nature, he let the rest of the theological science alone, and went on his way rejoicing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Yet it was no slight thing that had happened to him. A man's Faith is the man. Not to have a Faith is not to be a man. Beyond all comparison, the most important fact of a man's life is the formation of the <name>Faith</name> which he adheres to and lives by. And though <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0005.00075.00175" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> has occupied himself little with things spiritual, confining himself, by a necessity of his nature, chiefly to the promotion of material interests, yet I doubt not that this early change in his religious belief was the event which gave to all his subsequent life its direction and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>Whether that change was a desirable <num value="1">one</num>, or an undesirable, is a question upon which the reader of course has a decided opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The following, perhaps, may be taken as the leading consequences of a deliberate and intelligent exchange of a severe creed in which a person has been educated, for a less severe <num value="1">one</num> to which he attains by the operations of his own mind:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>It quickens his understanding, and multiplies his ideas to an extent which, it is said, no <num value="1">one</num> who has never experienced it can possibly conceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>It induces in him a habit of original reflection upon subjects of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>It makes him slow to believe a thing, merely because many believe it&mdash;merely because it has long been believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>It renders him open to conviction, for he cannot forget that there was a time when he told opinions which he now clearly sees to be <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>It dissolves the spell of Authority; it makes him distrustful of Great Names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>It lessens his terror of Public Opinion; for he has confronted it&mdash;discovered that it slows more teeth than it uses&mdash;that it harms only those who fear it&mdash;that it bows at length in homage to him whom it cannot frighten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>It throws him upon his own <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Formerly, Fear came to his assistance in moments of temptation; hell-fire rolled up its column of lurid smoke before him in the dreaded distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>But now he sees it not. If he has the <name>Intelligence</name> to know, the <rs>Heart</rs> to love, the <name>Will</name> to choose, the <name>Strength</name> to do, tile right; he does it, and his life is high, and pure, and noble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>If Intelligence, or Heart, or Will, or Strength is wanting to him, he vacillates; he is not an integer, his life is not. But, in either case, his Acts are the measure of his Worth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>Moreover, the struggle of a heretic with the practical difficulties of life, and particularly his early struggle, is apt to be a hard <num value="1">one</num>; for, <hi rend="italics">generally</hi>, the <name>Ridel</name>, the <name>Respectable</name>, the <name>Talented</name>, and the <name>Virtuous</name> of a nation are ranged on the side of its Orthodoxy in an overwhelming majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>They feel themselves allied with it&mdash;dependent upon it. Above all, they believe in it, and think they would be damned if they did not. They are slow to give their countenance to <num value="1">one</num> who dissents from their creed, even though he aspire only to make their sloes, or clean them, and though they more than suspect that the rival shoemaker round the corner keeps a religious newspaper on his counter solely for the effect of the thing upon pious consumers of shoe-leather.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>To depart from the established Faith, then, must be accounted a risk, a danger, a thing uncomfortable and complicating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>But, from the nettle Danger, <hi rend="italics">alone</hi>, we pluck the flower Safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>And he who loves Truth <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>&mdash;Advantage <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>&mdash;will certainly find Truth at length, and care little at what loss of Advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>So, let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind&mdash;with which safe and salutary text we may take leave of matters theological, and resume our story.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>In the message of <dateStruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></dateStruct>, the president repeated his recommendation, and again in that of <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>How attentively he watched the course of political events, how intelligently he judged them, at the age of <num value="13">thirteen</num>, may be inferred from a passage in an article which he wrote <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> after, the facts of which he stated from his early recollection of them:</p>

Father and son walked, side by side, to <placeName reg="Poultney, Rutland, Vermont" key="tgn,2109936">Poultney</placeName>, the boy carrying his possessions upon a stick over his shoulder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>At <placeName reg="Poultney, Rutland, Vermont" key="tgn,2109936">Poultney</placeName>, an unexpected difficulty arose, which for a time made <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> tremble in his high-low shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>The terms proposed by <persName n="Bliss,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0006.00087.00234" reg="nearbymention:Bliss,Amos,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bliss</surname></persName> were, that the boy should be bound for <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, and receive his board and <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Now, <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0006.00087.00235" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> had ideas of his own on the subject of apprenticeship, and he objected to this proposal, and to every particular of it. In the first place, he had determined that no child of his should ever be bound at all. In the second place, he thought <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> an unreasonable time; thirdly, he considered that <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> a year and board was a compensation ridiculously disproportionate to the services which <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> would be required to render; and finally, on each and all of these points, he clung to his opinion with the tenacity of a Greeley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/><persName n="Bliss,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0006.00087.00236" reg="nearbymention:Bliss,Amos,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bliss</surname></persName> appealed to the established custom of the country; <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> was the usual period; the compensation offered was the regular thing; the binding was a point essential to the employer's interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>And at every pause in the conversation, the appealing voice of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was heard: <q direct="unspecified">Father, I <hi rend="italics">guess</hi> you'd better make a bargain with <persName n="Bliss,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0006.00087.00237" reg="nearbymention:Bliss,Amos,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bliss</surname></persName>;</q> or, <q direct="unspecified">Father, I guess it won't make much difference;</q> or, <q direct="unspecified">Don't you think you'd better do it, father?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>At <num value="1">one</num> moment the boy was reduced to despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, then, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>,</q> said the father, <q direct="unspecified">let us go home.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The father turned to go; but <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> lingered; he could not give it up; and so the father turned again; the negotiation was re-opened, and after a prolonged discussion, a compromise was effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>What the terms were, that were finally agreed to, I cannot positively state, for the <num value="3">three</num> memoirs which I have consulted upon the subject give <num value="3">three</num> different replies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Probably, however, they were&mdash;no binding, and no money for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>; then the boy could, if he chose, bind himself for the remainder of the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, at <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">forty dollars</measure> a year, the apprentice to be boarded from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>And so the father went home, and the son went straight to the printing office and took his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson in the art of setting type.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>A few months after, it may be as well to mention here, Mr <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0218.0006.00088.00239" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> removed to <placeName reg="Erie, Pennsylvania, United States" key="tgn,1002358">Erie county, Pennsylvania</placeName>, and bought some wild land there, from which he gradually created a farm, leaving <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> alone in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Grass now grows where the little house stood in <placeName reg="Orland Hills, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7016381">Westhaven</placeName>, in which the family lived longest, and the barn in which they stored their hay and kept their cattle, leans forward like a kneeling elephant, and lets in the daylight through <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> apertures.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The new apprentice took his place at the font, and received from the foreman his <quote>copy,</quote> composing stick, and a few words of instruction, and then he addressed himself to his task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>He needed no further assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>The mysteries of the craft he seemed to comprehend intuitively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>He had thought of his chosen vocation for many years; he had formed a notion how the types <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be arranged in order to produce the desired impression, and, therefore, all he had to acquire was manual dexterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>In perfect silence, without looking to the right hand or to the left, heedless of the sayings and doings of the other apprentices, though they were bent on mischief, and tried to attract and distract his attention, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> worked on, hour after hour, all that day; and when he left the office at night could set type better and faster than many an apprentice who had had a month's practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>The next day, he worked with the same silence and intensity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>The boys were puzzled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>They thought it absolutely incumbent on them to perform an initiating rite of some kind; but the new boy gave them no handle, no excuse, no opening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>He committed no greenness, he spoke to no <num value="1">one</num>, looked at no <num value="1">one</num>, seemed utterly oblivious of every thing save only his copy and his type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>They threw type at him, but he never looked around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>They talked saucily at him, but he threw back no retort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>This would never do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>The boys, the journeyman, the pressman and the editor, all paused in their work to observe the result of this experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> neither spoke nor moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>He went on with his work as though nothing had happened, and soon after went to the tavern where he boarded, and spent an hour in purifying his dishonored locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>And that was all the <quote>fun</quote> the boys <quote>got out</quote> of their new companion on <hi rend="italics">that</hi> occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>They were conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was now fortunately situated.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Having a thirst for knowledge, he bent his mind and all his energies to its acquisition, with unceasing application and untiring devotion; and I doubt if, in the whole term of his apprenticeship, he ever spent an hour in the common recreations of young men. He used to pass my door as he went to his daily meals, and though I often sat near, or stood in the way, so much absorbed did he appear in his own thoughts&mdash;his head bent forward and his eyes fixed upon the ground, that I have the charity to believe the reason why he never turned his head or gave me a look, was because he had no idea I was there!</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>But I, who have conversed with those who were the friends and acquaintances of the youth, can tell a better story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>He had a remarkable fondness for games of mingled skill and chance, such as whist, draughts, chess, and others; and the office was never without its dingy pack of cards, carefully concealed from the reverend editor and the serious customers, but brought out from its hiding-place whenever the coast was clear and the boys had a leisure hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> never gambled, nor would he touch the cards on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>; but the delight of playing a game occasionally was heightened, perhaps, by the fact that in <placeName key="tgn,2109611" n="1.000 5" reg="east poultney, rutland, vermont">East Poultney</placeName> a pack of cards was regarded as a thing accursed, not fit for saintly hands to touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>To finish with this matter of amusement, I may mention that a dancing-school was held occasionally at the village-tavern, and <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was earnestly (ironically, perhaps) urged to join, it; but he refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>Not that he disapproved of the dance&mdash;that best of all home recreations&mdash;but he fancied he was not exactly the figure for a quadrille.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>He occasionally looked in at the door of the dancing-room, but never could be prevailed upon to enter it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>There happened to be among the residents of the place, during the apprenticeship of <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0006.00091.00245" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, a considerable number of intelligent men, men of some knowledge and talent&mdash;the editor of the paper, the village doctor, a county judge, a clergyman or <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> persons of some political eminence, a few well-informed mechanics, farmers, and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>These gentlemen had formed themselves into a <quote>Lyceum,</quote> before the arrival of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, and the <name>Lyceum</name> had become so famous in the neighborhood, that people frequently came a distance of <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> to attend its meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>He had read everything, and remembered the minutest details of important events; dates, names, places, figures, statistics&mdash;nothing had escaped him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>To the graces of oratory he made no pretence, but he was a fluent and interesting speaker, and had a way of giving an unexpected turn to the debate by reminding members of a fact, well known but overlooked; or by correcting a misquotation, or by appealing to what are called <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>He was an opponent to be afraid of; yet his sincerity and his earnestness were so evident, that those whom he most signally floored liked him none the less for it. He never lost his temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>In short, he spoke in his <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> year just as he speaks now; and when he came a year ago to lecture in a neighboring village, I saw before me the <rs>Horace Greeley</rs> of the old <placeName reg="Poultney, Rutland, Vermont" key="tgn,2109936">Poultney</placeName> <quote><placeName key="tgn,2008281" n="1.000 10" reg="Forum, Madison, Arkansas">Forum</placeName>,</quote> as we called it, and no other.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/></p> 
<p>It is hardly necessary to record, that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> never made the slightest preparation for the meetings of the <rs>Debating Society</rs> in the way of <hi rend="italics">dress&mdash;except</hi> so far as to put on his jacket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>In the summer, he was accustomed to wear, while at work, <num value="2">two</num> garments, a shirt and trowsers; and when the reader considers that his trowsers were very short, his sleeves tucked up above his elbows, his shirt open in front, he will have before his mind's eye the picture of a youth attired with extreme simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>In his walks about the village, he added to his dress a straw hat, valued originally at <measure n="1s." type="currency"><num value="1">one</num> shilling</measure>. In the winter, his clothing was really insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>So, at least, thought a kind-hearted lady who used to see him pass her window on his way to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/><q direct="unspecified">He never,</q> she says, <q direct="unspecified">had an overcoat while he lived here; and I used to pity him <hi rend="italics">so</hi> much in cold weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>I remember him as a slender, pale little fellow, younger looking than he really was, in a brown jacket much too <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> short for him. I used to think the winds would blow him away sometimes, as he crept along the fence lost in thought, with his head down, and his hands in his pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>He was often laughed at for his homely dress, by the boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>Once, when a very interesting question was to be debated at the school-house, a young man who was noted among us for the elegance of his dress and the length of his account at the store, advised <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> to get a new <quote>rig out</quote> for the occasion, particularly as he was to lead <num value="1">one</num> of the sides, and an unusually large audience was expected to be present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/><quote>No,</quote> said <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, <quote>I guess I'd better wear my old clothes than run in debt for new ones.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/></q> </p> 
<p>Now, <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">forty dollars</measure> a year is sufficient to provide a boy in the country with good and substantial clothing; half the sum will keep him warm and decent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>The reader, therefore, may be inclined to censure the young debater for his apparent parsimony; or worse, for an insolent disregard of the feelings of others; or, <hi rend="italics">worst</hi>, for a pride that aped humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>Well, thus it happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of the proudest and happiest days of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>I was a country boy then, a farmer's son, and we lived a few miles from <placeName key="tgn,2109611" n="1.000 5" reg="east poultney, rutland, vermont">East Poultney</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>On the day in question I was sent by my father to sell a load of potatoes at the store in <placeName key="tgn,2109611" n="1.000 5" reg="east poultney, rutland, vermont">East Poultney</placeName>, and bring back various commodities in exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Now this was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, you must know, that I had ever been entrusted with so important an errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>I had been to the village with my father often enough, but now I was to go alone, and I felt as proud and <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> independent as a midshipman the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time he goes ashore in command of a boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>Big with the fate of <num value="20">twenty</num> bushels of potatoes, off I drove-reached the village&mdash;sold out my load&mdash;drove round to the tavern&mdash;put up my horses, and went in to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>This going to the tavern on my own account, all by myself, and paying my own bill, was, I thought, the crowning glory of the whole adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>There were a good many people at dinner, the sheriff of the county and an ex-member of Congress among them, and I felt considerably abashed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but I had scarcely begun to eat, when my eyes fell upon an object so singular that I could do little else than stare at it all the while it remained in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>It was a tall, pale, white-haired, <hi rend="italics">gawky</hi> boy, seated at the further end of the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>He was in his shirt-sleeves, and he was eating with a rapidity and awkwardness that I never saw equaled before nor since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>It seemed as if he was eating for a wager, and had gone in to win. He neither looked up nor round, nor appeared to pay the least attention to the conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought was, <quote>This is a pretty sort of a tavern to let such a fellow as that sit at the same table with all these gentlemen; he ought to come in with the ostler.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>I thought it strange, too, that no <num value="1">one</num> seemed to notice him, and I supposed he owed his continuance at the table to that circumstance alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>And so I sat, eating little myself, and occupied in watching the wonderful performance of this wonderful youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>At length the conversation at the table became quite animated, turning upon some measure of an early Congress; and a question arose how certain members had voted on its final passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>There was a difference of opinion; and the sheriff, a very finely-dressed personage, I thought, to my boundless astonishment, referred the matter to the unaccountable Boy, saying, <quote>Aint that right, <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0218.0006.00096.00251" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/><quote>And you're wrong, too,</quote> said the still-devouring Mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>Then he laid down his knife and fork, and gave the history of the measure, explained the state of parties at the time, stated the vote in dispute, named the leading advocates and opponents of the bill, and, in short, gave a complete exposition of the whole matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>I listened and wondered; but what surprised me most was, that the company received his statement as pure gospel, and as settling the question beyond <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> dispute&mdash;as a dictionary settles a dispute respecting the spelling of a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>A minute after, the boy left the dining-room, and I never saw him again, till I met him, years after, in the streets of New York, when I claimed acquaintance with him as <persName><roleName n="Brother">a brother</roleName> <foreName>Vermontes</foreName></persName>, and told him this story, to his great amusement.</p></quote> </p>

He was then a remarkably plain-looking unsophisticated lad of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, with a slouching, careless gait, leaning away forward as he walked, as if both his head and his heels were too heavy for his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>He wore a wool hat of the old stamp, with so small a brim, that it looked more like a <num value="2">two</num>-quart measure inverted than a hat; and he had a singular, whining voice that provoked the merriment of the older apprentices, who had hardly themselves outgrown, in their brief village residence, similar peculiarities of country breeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>But the rogues could not help pluming themselves upon their superior manners and position; and it must be confessed that the young <quote> stranger </quote> was mercilessly <quote> taken in</quote> by his elders in the office, whenever an opportunity for a practical joke presented itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>But these things soon passed away, and as <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was seen to be an unusually intelligent and honest lad, he came to be better appreciated.

<p>In consequence of the change of proprietors, editors and other things pertaining to the management of the <rs type="place">Spectator office</rs>, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> had, during the term of his apprenticeship, about as many opportunities of <quote> boarding round,</quote> as ordinarily fall to the lot of a country schoolmaster.

And it was curious to see what a power of mental application he had&mdash;a power which enabled him, seated in the barroom, (where, perhaps, a dozen people were in earnest conversation,) to pursue undisturbed the reading of his favorite book, whatever it might be, with evidently as close attention and as much satisfaction as if he had been seated alone in his chamber.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>He had, however, a natural aptitude for arithmetical calculations, and could easily surpass, in his boyhood, most persons of his age in the facility and accuracy of his demonstrations; and his knowledge of grammar has been already noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>These things he rapidly and easily mastered, and treasured in his capacious memory, till we venture to say he has few if any equals at this time, in this particular department, in this or any other country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>This feeling oration was received with every demonstration of approval, and the proposition was carried into effect forthwith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>And now the damaged leg began to swell again prodigiously; at <num value="1">one</num> time it was as large below the knee as a demijohn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>Cut off from other employment, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> devoted all his attention to the unfortunate member, but without result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>The <rs type="place">Lake</rs> was there!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>An island, <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> long, but not <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> wide, once a part of the main land, lies opposite the town, at an apparent distance of half a mile, though in reality <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure> from the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>This island, which approaches the main land at either extremity, forms the harbor of <placeName reg="Erie, Erie, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7017542">Erie</placeName>, and gives to that part of the lake the effect of a river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Beyond, the <rs type="place">Great Lake</rs> stretches away further than the eye can reach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>A great lake in fine weather is like the ocean only in <num value="1">one</num> particular&mdash;you cannot see across it. The ocean asserts itself; it is demonstrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>It heaves, it flashes, it sparkles, it foams, it roars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>On the stillest day, it does not quite go to sleep; the tide steals up the white beach, and glides back again over the shells and pebbles musically, or it murmurs along the sides of black rocks, with a subdued though always audible voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>The ocean is a living and life-giving thing, <quote>fair, and fresh, and ever free.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>The lake, on a fine day, lies dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>No tide breaks upon its earthy shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>It is as blue as a blue ribbon, as blue as the sky; and vessels come sailing out of heaven, and go sailing into heaven, and no eye can discern where the lake ends and heaven begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>It is as smooth as a mirror's face, and as dull as a mirror's back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Often a light mist gathers over it, and then the lake is <hi rend="italics">gone</hi> from the prospect; but for an occasional sail dimly descried, or a streak of black smoke left by a passing steamer, it would give absolutely <hi rend="italics">no</hi> sign of its presence, though the spectator is standing <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile from the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>Oftener the mist gathers thickly along the horizon, and then; so perfect is the illusion, the stranger will swear he sees the opposite shore, not <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> off. There is no excitement in looking upon a lake, and it has no effect upon the appetite or the complexion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>Yet there is a quiet, languid beauty hovering over it, a beauty all its own, a charm that grows upon the mind the longer you linger upon the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>The Castle of Indolence should have been placed upon the bank of <placeName reg="Lake Erie, United States" key="tgn,2318573">Lake Erie</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>where its inmates could have lain on the grass and gazed down, <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> through all the slow hours of the long summer day, upon the lazy, hazy, blue expanse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>When the wind blows, the lake wakes up; and still it is not the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>The waves are discolored by the earthy bank upon which they break with un-oceanlike monotony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>They neither advance nor recede, nor roar, nor <hi rend="italics">sell</hi>. A great lake, with all its charms, and they are many and great, is only an infinite pond.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>The people of <placeName reg="Erie, Erie, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7017542">Erie</placeName> care as much for the lake as the people of <placeName reg="Niagara, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002718">Niagara</placeName> care for the cataract, as much as people generally care for anything wonderful or anything beautiful which they can see by turning their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>In other words, they care for it as the means by which lime, coal, and lumber may be transported to another and a better market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> house is built along the shore, though the shore is high and level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>Not a path has been worn by human feet above or below the bluff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>Pigs, sheep, cows, and sweet-brier bushes occupy the unenclosed ground, which seems so <hi rend="italics">made</hi> to be built upon that it is surprising the handsome houses of the-town should have been built anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>The <name n="United States">American</name> vessel usually lies in the harbor of <placeName reg="Erie, Erie, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7017542">Erie</placeName>, and a few officers may be seen about the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>What the busy journeyman printer thought of those idle gentlemen, apparently the only quite useless, and certainly the best dressed, persons in the place, may be guessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>Perhaps, however, he passed them by, in his absent way, and saw them not.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>In a few days, the new comer was in high favor at the office of the <orgName n="Erie Gazette" type="newspaper">Erie Gazette</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>He is remembered there as a remarkably correct and reliable compositor, though not as a rapid <num value="1">one</num>, and his steady devotion to his work enabled him to accomplish more than faster workmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>He was soon placed by his employer on the footing of a regular journeyman, at the usual wages, <measure n="12dollars" type="currency">twelve dollars</measure> a month and board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>All the intervals of labor he spent in reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>As soon as the hour of cessation arrived, he would hurry off his apron, wash his hands, and lose himself in his book or his newspapers, often forgetting his dinner, and often forgetting whether he had <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> his dinner or not. More and more, he became absorbed in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>It is said, by <num value="1">one</num> who worked beside him at <placeName reg="Erie, Erie, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7017542">Erie</placeName>, that he could tell the name, <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> address, and something of the history and political leanings, of every member of Congress; and that he could give the particulars of every important election that had occurred within his recollection, even, in some instances, to the county majorities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>And thus, in earnest work and earnest reading, <num value="7">seven</num> profitable and not unhappy months passed swiftly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>He never lost <num value="1">one</num> day's work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>On <date value="--7">Sundays</date>, he read, or walked along the shores of the lake, or sailed over to the <rs type="place">Island</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>His better fortune made no change either in his habits or his appearance; and his employer was surprised, that month after month passed, and yet his strange journeyman drew no money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>Once, <persName n="Sterritt,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0007.00117.00317" reg="nearbymention:Sterritt,Joseph,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sterritt</surname></persName> ventured to rally him a little upon his persistence in wearing the hereditary homespun, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Now, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, you have a good deal of money coming to you; don't go about the town any longer in that outlandish rig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>However, a short time after, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> <hi rend="italics">did</hi> make a faint effort to dress up a little; but the few articles which he bought were so extremely coarse and common, that it was a question in the office whether his appearance was improved by the change, or the contrary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>At the end of <dateStruct value="-7-"><month reg="7">the seventh month</month></dateStruct>, the man whose sickness had made a temporary vacancy in the <orgName>office of the Gazette</orgName>, returned to his place, and there was, in consequence, no more work for <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0007.00117.00319" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>Upon the settlement of his account, it appeared that he had drawn for his personal expenses during his residence at <placeName reg="Erie, Erie, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7017542">Erie</placeName>, the sum of <hi rend="italics"><num value="6">six</num> dollars</hi>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>This note the generous fellow gave to his father, reserving the money to carry on his own personal warfare with the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>And now, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was tired of dallying with fortune in country <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> printing offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>He said, he thought it was time to <hi rend="italics">do</hi> something, and he formed the bold resolution of going straight to New York and seeking his fortune in the metropolis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>New York was, and is, a city of adventurers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Few of our eminent citizens were born here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>It is a common boast among New Yorkers, that this great merchant and that great millionaire came to the city a ragged boy, with only <num value="3">three</num> and sixpence in his pocket; and <hi rend="italics">now</hi> look at him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1456"/>There was not a human being upon whom he had any claim for help or advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>His appearance was all against him. He looked in his round jacket like an overgrown boy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>He was somewhat timorous in his intercourse with strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>He would not intrude upon their attention; he had not the faculty of pushing his way, and proclaiming his merits and his desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>To the arts by which men are conciliated, by which unwilling ears are forced to attend to an unwelcome tale, he was utterly a stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>Moreover, he had neglected to bring with him any letters of recommendation, or any certificate of his skill as a printer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>It had not occurred to him that anything of the kind was necessary, so unacquainted was he with the life of cities.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>He bought some clothes, with a view to render himself more presentable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>They were of the commonest kind, and the garments were few, but the purchase absorbed nearly half his capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Satisfied with his appearance, he now began the round of the printing-offices, going into every <num value="1">one</num> he could find, and asking for employment&mdash;merely asking, and going away, without a word, as soon as he was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>In the course of the morning, he found himself in the office of the <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName>, and he chanced to direct his inquiry, <quote>if they wanted a hand,</quote> to the late <rs>David Hale</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the proprietors of the paper.

<p><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, more amused than indignant, retired, and pursued his way to the next office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>All that day he walked the streets, climbed into upper stories, came down again, ascended other heights, descended, dived into basements, traversed passages, groped through labyrinths, ever asking the same question, <quote> Do you want a hand </quote> and ever receiving the same reply, in various degrees of civility, <quote><hi rend="italics">No</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>He walked <num value="10">ten</num> times as many miles as he needed, for he was not aware that nearly all the printing-offices in New York are in the same square mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>He went the entire length of many streets which any body could have told him did not contain <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>He went home on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> very tired and a little discouraged.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>Early on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> he resumed the search, and continued it with energy till the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> wanted a hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>Business seemed to be at a stand-still, or every office had its full complement of men. On <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> he was still more fatigued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>Though discouraged, he was not disheartened, and still less alarmed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>The youthful reader should observe here what a sense of independence and what fearlessness dwell in the spirit of a man who has learned the art of living on the mere necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was, of course, subjected to a constant fire of jocular observations upon his dress, and frequently to practical jokes suggested by its deficiencies and redundancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>For all jokes upon the subject he had deaf ears; and if any <num value="1">one</num> seriously remonstrated, he would not defend himself by explaining, that all the money he could spare was needed in the wilderness, <measure n="600miles" type="distance">six hundred miles</measure> away, whither he punctually sent it. <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> passed and <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>It began to be cold, but our hero had been toughened by the winters of <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, and still he walked about in linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>The garments were fashionably cut; the coat was in the style of a swallow's tail; the figure was precisely that of an old gentleman who had seen better days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>It advanced from the darker parts of the office, and emerged slowly into the glare around the composing stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>The men looked inquiringly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>The figure spread out its hands, looked down at its habiliments with an air of infinite complacency, and said,&mdash;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>It was against the rules of the office for a compositor to enter the press-room, which adjoined the composing-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>Our hero, however, went on <num value="1">one</num> occasion to the forbidden apartment to speak to a friend who worked there upon a hand-press that was exceedingly hard to pull.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>He loved commas, he was a stickler for commas, he was irritable on the subject of commas, he thought more of commas than any other point of prosody, and above all, he was of opinion that he knew more about commas than <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0008.00130.00355" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/><persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> had, on his part, no objection to commas, but he loved them in moderation, and was determined to keep them in their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>Debates ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>The journeyman expounded the subject, and at length, after much argument, convinced his employer that a redundancy of commas was possible, and, in short, that he, the journeyman, knew how to preserve the balance of power between the various points, without the assistance or advice of any boss or man in <placeName reg="Chatham, Columbia, New York" key="tgn,2068456">Chatham</placeName>, or any other street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>There was, likewise, a certain professor whose book was printed in the office, and who often came to read the proofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>It chanced that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> set up a few pages of this book, and took the liberty of altering a few phrases that seemed to him inelegant or incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>The professor was indignant, and though he was not so ignorant as not to perceive that his language had been altered for the better, he thought it due to his dignity to apply approbrious epithets to the impertinent compositor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>The compositor argued the matter, but did not appease the great man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Soon after obtaining work, our friend found a better boardinghouse, at least a more convenient <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>On the corner of <address><street n="Duanestreet Street">Duanestreet</street></address> and <address><street n="Chatham Street">Chatham</street></address> there was, at that time, a large building, occupied below as a grocery and bar-room, the upper stories as a mechanics' <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> boarding-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>It accommodated about <num value="50">fifty</num> boarders, most of whom were shoe-makers, who worked in their own rooms, or in shops at the top of the house, and paid, for room and board, <measure n="2.5dollars" type="currency">two dollars and a half</measure> per week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>This was the house to which <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0008.00131.00356" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> removed, a few days after his arrival in the city, and there he lived for more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. The reader of the <name>Tribune</name> may, perhaps, remember, that its editor has frequently displayed a particular acquaintance with the business of shoe-making, and drawn many illustrations of the desirableness and feasibility of association from the excessive labor and low wages of shoemakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>It was at this house that he learned the mysteries of the craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>He was accustomed to go up into the shops, and sit among the men while waiting for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>It was here, too, that he obtained that general acquaintance with the life and habits of city mechanics, which has enabled him since to address them so wisely and so convincingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>He is remembered by those who lived with him there, only as a very quiet, thoughtful, studious young man, <num value="1">one</num> who gave no trouble, never went out <quote>to spend the evening,</quote> and read nearly every minute when he was not working or eating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>The reader is aware, perhaps, from experience, that people who pay only <measure n="2.5dollars" type="currency">two dollars and a half</measure> per week for board and lodging are not provided with all the luxuries of the season; and that, not unfrequently, a desire for something delicious steals over the souls of boarders, particularly on <date value="--7">Sundays</date>, between <num value="12">12</num>, M. and <num value="1">1</num>., P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>There are not, I presume, <num value="25">twenty-five</num> persons alive, who know in whose head it was, that the idea of a cheap daily paper originated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>Nor has the proprietor of that head ever derived from his idea, which has enriched so many others, the smallest pecuniary advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>He walks these streets, this day, an unknown man, and poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>His name&mdash;the reader may forget it, History will not&mdash;is <persName n="Sheppard,,Horatio,David,," id="n0218.0010.00139.00391" reg="default:Sheppard,Horatio,David,,"><foreName>Horatio</foreName> <foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Sheppard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>The story of his idea, amply confirmed in every particular by living and unimpeachable witnesses, is the following:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>About the year <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Sheppard,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0010.00139.00392" reg="nearbymention:Sheppard,Horatio,David,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sheppard</surname></persName>, recently come of age and into the possession of <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure>, moved from his native <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> to New York, and entered the <rs type="place">Eldridge Street</rs> <orgName n="Medical School" type="school">Medical School</orgName> as a student of medicine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>He was ambitious and full of ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>Of course, therefore, his <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure> <hi rend="italics">burned</hi> in his vest pocket&mdash;(where he actually used to carry it, until a fellow student almost compelled him to deposit it in a place of safety). He took to dabbling in newspapers and periodicals, a method of getting rid of superfluous cash, which is as expeditious as it is fascinating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>He soon had an interest in a medical magazine, and soon after, a share in a weekly paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>By the time he had completed his medical studies, he had gained some insight into the nature of the newspaper business, and lost the greater part of his money.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>People who live in <address><street n="Eldridge street">Eldridge street</street></address>, when they have occasion to go <quote>down town,</quote> must necessarily pass through <address><street n="Chatham street">Chatham street</street></address>, a thoroughfare which is noted, among many other things, for the extraordinary number of articles which are sold in it for a <quote>penny a piece.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Apple-stalls, peanut-stalls, stalls for the sale of oranges, melons, pine-apples, cocoanuts, chestnuts, candy, <rs n="shoe laces" type="product">shoe-laces</rs>, cakes, <rs n="pocket combs" type="product">pocket-combs</rs>, <rs n="ice cream" type="product">ice-cream</rs>, suspenders, lemonade, and oysters, line the sidewalk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>In <address><street n="Chatham street">Chatham street</street></address>, those small trades are carried on, on a scale of magnitude, with a loudness of vociferation, and a <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> flare of lamp-light, unknown to any other part of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Along <address><street n="Chatham street">Chatham street</street></address>, our medical student ofttimes took his way, musing on the instability of <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure>, and observing, possibly envying, the noisy merchants of the stalls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>He was struck with the rapidity with which they sold their penny ware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>A small boy would sell half a dozen penny cakes in the course of a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>The difference between a cent, and no money, did not seem to be appreciated by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>If a person saw something, wanted it, knew the price to be only a cent, he was almost as certain to buy it as though it were offered him for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Now, thought he, to make a fortune, <num value="1">one</num> has nothing more to do than to produce a tempting article which can be sold profitably for a cent, place it where everybody can see it, and buy it, without stopping&mdash;and lo!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>the thing is done!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>If it were only <hi rend="italics">possible</hi> to produce a small, spicy daily paper for a cent, and get boys to sell it about the streets, <hi rend="italics">how</hi> it would sell!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>How many pennies that now go for cakes and peanuts would be spent for news and paragraphs!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>The idea was born&mdash;the twin ideas of the penny paper and the newsboy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>But, like the young of the kangaroo, they crawled into the mental pouch of the teeming originator, and nestled there for months, before they were fully formed and strong enough to confront the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Perhaps it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> possible, continued the musing man of medicine, on a subsequent walk in <address><street n="Chatham street">Chatham street</street></address>. He went to a paper warehouse, and made inquiries touching the price of the cheaper kinds of printing paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>He figured up the cost of composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>He computed office expenses and editorial salaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>He estimated the probable circulation of a penny paper, and the probable income to be derived from advertising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>Surely, he could sell <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> a day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/><hi rend="italics">There</hi>, for instance, is a group of people; suppose a boy were at this moment to go up to <hi rend="italics">them</hi> with an armful of papers, only <num value="1">one</num> cent, I am positive, thought the sanguine projector, that <num value="6">six</num> of the <num value="9">nine</num> would buy a copy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>His conclusion was, that he could produce a newspaper about twice the size of an average sheet of <rs n="letter paper" type="product">letter-paper</rs>, half paragraphs and half advertisements, and sell it at a cent per copy, with an ample profit to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>He was <hi rend="italics">sure</hi> of it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>He had tried all his arithmetic upon the project, and he figures gave the same result always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The twins leaped from <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> the pouch, and taking their progenitor by the throat, led him a fine dance before he could shake them off. For the present, they possessed him wholly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>As most of his little inheritance had vanished, it was necessary for him to interest some <num value="1">one</num> in the scheme who had either capital or a printing office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>The <orgName n="Spirit of the Times" type="newspaper">Spirit of the Times</orgName> was then in its infancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>He came in soon after, and began telling in high glee a story he had picked up of old <placeName reg="Isaac Hill">Isaac Hill</placeName>, who used to read his speeches in the <rs type="place">House</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> day brought the wrong speech, and got upon his legs, and half way into a swelling exordium before he discovered his mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>The narrator told his story extremely well, taking off the embarrassment of the old gentleman as he gradually came to the knowledge of his misfortune, to the life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>The company were highly amused, and <persName n="Sheppard,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0010.00141.00396" reg="nearbymention:Sheppard,Horatio,David,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sheppard</surname></persName> said to himself, <q direct="unspecified">That's no common <hi rend="italics">boy</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>Perhaps it was an unfortunate moment to introduce a bold and novel idea; but it is certain that every individual present, from the editor to the devil, regarded the notion of a penny paper as <num value="1">one</num> of extreme absurdity,&mdash;foolish, ridiculous, frivolous!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>They took it as a joke, and the schemer took his leave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>Nor is it at all surprising that they should have regarded it in that light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>A daily newspaper in those days was a solemn thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>People in moderate circumstances seldom saw, never bought <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>The price was <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> a years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>Cut the present <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName> in halves, fold it, fancy on its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> page half a column of serious editorial, a column of news, half a column of business and shipping intelligence, and the rest of the ample sheet covered with advertisements, and you have before your mind's eye the New York daily paper of <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> ago. It was not a thing for the people; it appertained to the counting-house; it was taken by the wholesale dealer; it was cumbrous, heavy, solemn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>The idea of making it an article to be cried about the streets, to be sold for a cent, to be bought by workingmen and boys, to come into competition with cakes and apples, must have seemed to the respectable New Yorkers of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, unspeakably absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>He takes his readers into his <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> confidence, his sanctum, and his iron safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>He has not the least objection to tell the public the number of his subscribers, the amount of his receipts, the excess of his receipts over his expenditures, or the excess of his expenditures over his receipts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>Accordingly, the whole history of the <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName>, and the story of its editor's joys and sorrows, his trials and his triumphs, lie plainly and fully written in the <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName> itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>The <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName> was, incomparably, the best newspaper of its kind that had ever been published in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>It was printed, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, upon a large folio sheet; afterwards, in <num value="2">two</num> forms, folio and quarto, the former at <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> a year, the latter at <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Its contents were of <num value="4">four</num> kinds; literary matter, selected from home and foreign periodicals, and well selected; editorial articles by the editor, vigorously and courteously expressed; news, chiefly political, compiled with an accuracy new to American journalism; city, literary, and miscellaneous paragraphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>The paper took no side in politics, though the ardent convictions of the editor were occasionally manifest, in spite of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>The heat and fury of some of his later writings never characterize the essays of the <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>He was always gentle, however strong and decided; and there was a modesty and candor in his manner of writing that made the subscriber a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>For example, in the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> number, announcing the publication of certain mathematical books, he says, <q direct="unspecified">As we are not ourselves conversant with the higher branches of mathematics, we cannot pretend to speak authoritatively upon the merits of these publications</q>&mdash;a kind of avowal which omniscient editors are not prone to make.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>No wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Neither of the proprietors had any reputation with the public; all of them were very young, and the editor evidently supposed that it was only necessary to make a good paper in order to sell a great many copies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Publishers</q> Address, <quote> indeed, expressly said:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>The public took the <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName> at its word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> number had a sale of nearly <num value="200">two hundred</num> copies, and for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, the increase averaged a <num value="100">hundred</num> copies a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>He enjoyed his position thoroughly, and he labored not more truly with all his might, than with all his heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>The spirit in which he performed his duties, and the glee with which he entered into the comicalities of editorial life, cannot be more agreeably shown than by transcribing his own account of a Scene which was enacted in the office of the <orgName n="New Yorker" type="newspaper">New Yorker</orgName>, soon after its establishment.

<p>To a philosophical observer, the existence of domestic servitude in <num value="1">one</num> portion of the <rs>Union</rs> while it is forbidden and condemned in another, would indeed seem to afford no plausible pretext for variance or alienation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>The Union was formed with a perfect knowledge, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, that slavery existed at the south, and, on the other, that it was utterly disapproved and discountenanced at the north.

<p>The great pervading evil of our social condition is the worship and the bigotry of Opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>While the theory of our political institutions asserts or implies the absolute freedom of the human mind&mdash;the right not only of free thought and discussion, but of the most unrestrained action thereon within the wide boundaries prescribed by the laws of the land, yet the <hi rend="italics">practical commentary</hi> upon this noble text is as discordant as imagination can conceive.

<p>Ours is a plain story; and it shall be plainly told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>Of the unnumbered pangs that mortals know, pecuniary anxiety is to a sensitive and honest <hi rend="italics">young</hi> heart the bitterest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>By association I mean a Social Order, which shall take the place of the present Township, to be composed of some hundreds or some <num value="1000">thousands</num> of persons, who shall be united together in interest and industry for the purpose of securing to each individual the following things: <num value="1">1</num>, an elegant and commodious house; <num value="2">2</num>, an education, complete and thorough; <num value="3">3</num>, a secure subsistence; <num value="4">4</num>, opportunity to labor; <num value="5">5</num>, fair wages; <num value="6">6</num>, agreeable social relations; <num value="7">7</num>, progress in knowledge and skill.

The property of an association will be vested in those who contributed the capital to establish it, represented by shares of stock, just as the property of a bank, factory, or railroad now is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>Men will be induced to labor by a knowledge that its rewards will be a certain and major proportion of the product, which of course will be less or more according to the skill and industry of each individual.

Then the contract is simply this:&mdash;<hi rend="italics"><num value="1">One</num> rich man (or company) owns <measure n="5000acres" type="area">five thousand acres</measure> of land, which he leases forever to <num value="2000">two thousand</num> poor men at the yearly rent of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of its products</hi>. It is an affair of landlord and tenant&mdash;the lease perpetual, payment in kind; and the landlord to own the cattle, tools, and furniture of the tenant, as well as the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>Association, then, is merely a plan for extending the relation of landlord and tenant over the whole arable surface of the earth.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>In an ordinary township, however, the increase, though all created by Labor, is chiefly owned by Capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>The majority of the inhabitants remain poor; while a few&mdash;merchants, land-owners, mill-owners, and manufacturers&mdash;are enriched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>That this is the fact in recently-settled townships, is undeniable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>The capitalists, bear in mind, are the absolute owners of the entire property of the association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>In <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, that property may be worth half a <num value="1000000">million</num>, and it still remains the property of the capitalists, the laborers having annually drawn their share of the products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>They may have saved a portion of their annual share, and thus have accumulated property; but they have no more title to the <hi rend="italics">domain</hi> than they had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>If the concern should not prosper, the laborers could not buy shares; if it should, the capitalists would not sell except at their increased value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>What advantage, then, does association offer for the poor man's acquiring property superior to that afforded by the present state of things?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>None, that we can see. On the contrary, the more rapidly the domain of an association should increase in value, the more difficult it would be for the laboring man to rise to the class of proprietors; and this would simply be an <hi rend="italics">aggravation</hi> of the worst features of the social system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>The apportionment is repeated every year; and the proportion of the new stock assigned to Capital is such that when the property of the association is worth half a <num value="1000000">million</num>, Capital will own about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>Under the present system, capital is everything, man nothing, except as a means of accumulating capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>For instance: <persName><foreName>Fenimore</foreName></persName> instructed him to say, that our letter from <persName n="Fonda,,,,," id="n0218.0018.00227.00845" reg="mostcommon:Fonda,nomatch:0"><surname>Fonda</surname></persName> above recited purported to be from the <quote>correspondent of the <name>Tribune</name>,</quote> and thence to draw and press on the <name>Jury</name> the inference that the letter was written by some of our own <hi rend="italics">corps</hi>, whom we had sent to <persName n="Fonda,,,,," id="n0218.0018.00227.00846" reg="mostcommon:Fonda,nomatch:0"><surname>Fonda</surname></persName> to report these trials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/>After a suitable admonition from the <rs>Justice</rs>, and on payment of the usual fine, he was discharged.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/></p> 
<p>Now, our reporter, who, no more than we, ever before heard of <hi rend="italics">this</hi> <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0218.0018.00228.00852" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, is only ambitious to do his duty correctly and thoroughly, to make his description accurate and graphic, and perhaps to protect better men who rejoice in the cognomen of <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0218.0018.00228.00853" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, from being confounded with this <num value="1">one</num> in the popular rumor of his misadventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>If the paragraph should come under our notice, we should probably strike it out altogether, as relating to a subject of no public moment, and likely to crowd out better matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>But we do not see it, and in it goes: Well: <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0218.0018.00228.00854" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who <quote> acknowledges the corn</quote> as to being accidentally drunk and getting into the watch-house, is not willing to rest under the imputation of being hatched-faced and having mouse-colored whiskers, retains <persName n="Cooper,Mister,Richard,,," id="n0218.0018.00228.00855" reg="default:Cooper,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>&mdash;for he could not do better&mdash;and commences an action for libel against us. We take the best legal advice, and are told that we must <hi rend="italics">demur</hi> to the <name>Declaration</name>&mdash;that is, go before a court without jury, where no facts can be shown, and maintain that the matter charged as uttered by us is not libelous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>But <persName n="Cooper,Mister,R.,,," id="n0218.0018.00228.00856" reg="expanded:Cooper,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName> meets us there and says justly: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>How is the court to decide without evidence that this matter is not libelous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>If it was written and inserted for the express purpose of ridiculing and bringing into contempt my client, it clearly <hi rend="italics">is</hi> libelous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>And then as to damages: My client is neither rich nor a great man, but his character, in his own circle, is both dear and valuable to him. We shall be able to show on trial that he was on the point of contracting marriage with the daughter of the keeper of the most fashionable and lucrative oyster-cellar in <address><street n="Orange street">Orange street</street></address>, whose nerves were so shocked at the idea of her intended having a <quote>hatchet face and mouse-colored whiskers,</quote> that she fainted outright on reading the paragraph <pb id="p.229" n="229"/> (copied from your paper into the next day's <quote>Sun</quote> ), and was not brought to until a whole bucket of oysters which she had just opened had been poured over her in a hurried mistake for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>Since then, she has frequent relapses and shuddering, especially when my client's name is mentioned, and utterly refuses to see or speak of him. The match is dead broke, and my client loses thereby a capital home, where victuals are more plentiful and the supply more steady than it has been his fortune to find them for the last year or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>He loses, with all this, a prospective interest in the concern, and is left utterly without business or means of support except this suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>Besides, how can you tell, in the absence of all testimony, that the editor was not paid to insert this villanous description of my client, by some envious rival for the affections of the oyster&mdash;maid, who calculates both to gratify his spite and advance his lately hopeless wooing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>In this case, it certainly is a libel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>We affirm this to be the case, and you are bound to presume that it is. The demurrer must be overruled.</p></quote> And so it must be. No judge could decide otherwise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/></p> 
<p>Now we are thrown back upon a dilemma: Either we must plead <hi rend="italics">Justfication</hi>, in which case <hi rend="italics">we admit that our publication was on its face a libel</hi>; and now, woe to us if we cannot prove <persName n="Cooper,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0018.00229.00857" reg="nearbymention:Cooper,R.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s client's face as sharp, and his whiskers of the precise color as stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>A shade more or less ruins us. For, be it known, by attempting a Justification we have not merely admitted our offense to be a libel, but <hi rend="italics">our plea is an aggravation of the libel</hi>, and entitles the plaintiff to recover higher and more exemplary damages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>But we have just <num value="1">one</num> chance more: to plead the <hi rend="italics">general issue</hi>&mdash;to wit, that we <hi rend="italics">did not</hi> libel the said <rs>John Smith</rs>, and go into court prepared to show that we had no malice toward or intent to injure <persName n="Smith,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0018.00229.00858" reg="nearbymention:Smith,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, never heard of him before, and have done all we knew how to make him reparation&mdash;in short, that we have done and intended nothing which brings us fairly within the iron grasp of the law of libel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>But here again, while trying our best to get in somehow a plea of Not Guilty, we have actually pleaded Guilty!&mdash;so says the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> law of New York&mdash;our admitted publication (no matter of what) concerning <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0218.0018.00229.00859" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> proves irresistibly that we <hi rend="italics">have</hi> libeled him&mdash;we are not entitled in any way whatever to go to the <name>Jury</name> with evidence tending to show that our publication is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> a libel&mdash;or, in overthrow of the legal <hi rend="italics">presumption</hi> of malice, to show that there actually <hi rend="italics">was</hi> none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>All that we possibly can offer must be taken into account merely in mitigation of damages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>He put very strongly against us the fact that our <persName n="Fonda,,,,," id="n0218.0018.00229.00860" reg="mostcommon:Fonda,nomatch:0"><surname>Fonda</surname></persName> correspondent (see Declaration above) considered <persName><foreName>Fenimore</foreName></persName>'s verdict there a meagre <num value="1">one</num>. <quote> Gentlemen of the jury,</quote> said he, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>The exultation over the <quote>meagre verdict</quote> was expressly in view of the fact, that the cause was <hi rend="italics">undefended</hi>&mdash;that <persName><foreName>Fenimore</foreName></persName> and his counsel had it all their own way, evidence, argument, charge, and all. Still, <persName><foreName>Richard</foreName></persName> had a good chance here to appeal for a large verdict, and he did it well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>On <num value="1">one</num> other point <persName><foreName>Richard</foreName></persName> talked more like a cheap lawyer and less like a&mdash;like what we had expected of him&mdash;than through the general course of his argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>In his pleadings, he had set forth <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0018.00230.00861" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mc-Elrath,,Thomas,,," id="n0218.0018.00230.00862" reg="default:Mc-Elrath,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Mc-Elrath</surname></persName> as <hi rend="italics">Editors</hi> and Proprietors of the <name>Tribune</name>, and we readily enough admitted whatever he chose to assert about us except the essential thing in dispute between us. Well, on the strength of this he puts it to the <rs type="place">Court</rs> and Jury, that <persName n="McElrath,,Thomas,,," id="n0218.0018.00230.00863" reg="default:McElrath,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>McElrath</surname></persName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Editors</name> of the <name>Tribune</name>, and that be, being (having been) a lawyer, would have been in Court to defend this suit, if there was any valid defense to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>This, of course, went very hard against us; and it was to no purpose that we informed him that <persName n="McElrath,,Thomas,,," id="n0218.0018.00230.00864" reg="default:McElrath,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>McElrath</surname></persName>, though legally implicated in it, had nothing to do practically with this matter&mdash;(all which he knew very well long before)&mdash;and that the other defendant is the man who does whatever libeling is done in the <name>Tribune</name>, and holds himself everywhere responsible for it. We presume there is not much doubt even so far off as <placeName key="tgn,7013650" n="1.000 19" reg="cooperstown, otsego, new york">Cooperstown</placeName> as to who edits the <name>Tribune</name>, and who wrote the editorial about the <name>Fonda</name> business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>(In point of fact, the real and palpable defendant in this suit never even conversed with his partner <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour altogether about this subject, considering it entirely his own job; and the plaintiff himself, in conversation with <persName n="McElrath,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0018.00230.00865" reg="nearbymention:McElrath,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McElrath</surname></persName>, in the presence of <hi rend="italics">his attorney</hi>, had fully exonerated Mr. M. from anything more than legal liability.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>Many of them were long and elaborate, extending, in several instances, to <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4">four</num> columns; and, as they were Essays upon authors, rather than Reviews of Books, she indulged sparingly in extract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>She wrote, also, a few musical and dramatic critiques.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>Among her general contributions, were essays upon the <name>Rights</name>, Wrongs, and Duties of Women, a defence of the <quote><name>Irish</name> character,</quote> articles upon <quote>Christmas,</quote> <quote><dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New year's day</occasion></dateStruct>,</quote> <quote>French Gayety,</quote> <quote>the <rs>Poor Man</rs>,</quote> <quote>the <rs>Rich Man</rs>,</quote> <quote>What fits a man to be a Voter </quote> &mdash;genial, fresh, and suggestive essays all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>Her understanding was greater than her gift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>She could appreciate, not create.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>She was the noblest victim of that modern error, which makes Education and Book-knowledge synonymous terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>Her brain was terribly stimulated in childhood by the study of works utterly unfit for the nourishment of a child's mind, and in after life, it was further stimulated by the adulation of circles who place the highest value upon Intelligence, and no value at all upon Wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>It cost her the best years of her life to unlearn the errors, and to overcome the mental habits of her earlier years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>But she did it. Her triumph was complete.

<p>Yet, it was the suggestion of <persName n="Greeley,Mrs.,,,," id="n0218.0020.00256.00996" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>&mdash;who had spent some weeks of successive seasons in or near <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and who had there made the personal acquaintance of <persName n="Fuller,Miss,,,," id="n0218.0020.00256.00997" reg="nearbymention:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>, and formed a very high estimate and warm attachment for her&mdash;that induced me, in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>, to offer her terms, which were accepted, for her assistance in the literary department of <hi rend="italics">The Tribune</hi>. A home in my family was included in the stipulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>I was my self barely acquainted with her when she thus came to reside with us, and <num value="1">1</num> did not fully appreciate her nobler qualities for some months afterward Though we were members of the same household, we scarcely met save at breakfast; and my time and thoughts were absorbed in duties and cares, which left me little leisure or inclination for the amenities of social intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>Fortune seemed to delight in placing us <num value="2">two</num> in relations of friendly antagonism&mdash;or rather, to develop all possible contrasts in our ideas and social habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>She was naturally inclined to luxury, and a good appearance before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>My pride, if I had any, delighted in bare walls and rugged fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>She was addicted to strong tea and coffee, both of which I rejected and condemned, even in the most homoeopathic dilutions; while, my general health <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> being sound, and hers sadly impaired, I could not fail to find in her dietectic habits the causes of her almost habitual illness; and once, while we were still barely acquainted, when she came to the breakfast-table with a very severe headache, I was tempted to attribute it to her strong potations of the <name>Chinese</name> leaf the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>She told me quite frankly that she declined being lectured on the food or beverage she saw fit to take, which was but reasonable in <num value="1">one</num> who had arrived at her maturity of intellect and fixedness of habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>So the subject was thenceforth tacitly avoided between us; but, though words were suppressed, looks and involuntary gestures could not so well be; and an utter divergency of views on this and kindred themes created a perceptible distance between us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/></p> 
<p>Her earlier contributions to The Tribune were not her best, and I did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prize her aid so highly as I afterward learned to do. She wrote always freshly, vigorously, but not always clearly; for her full and intimate acquaintance with continental literature, especially <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0218.0020.00257.00998" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, seemed to have marred her felicity and readiness of expression in her mother tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>While I never met another woman who conversed more freely or lucidly, the attempt to commit her thoughts to paper seemed to induce a singular embarrassment and hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>She could write only when in the vein, and this needed often to be waited for through several days, while the occa---sion sometimes required an immediate utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>The new book must be reviewed before other journals had thoroughly dissected and discussed it, else the ablest critique would command no general attention, and perhaps be, by the greater number, unread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>That the writer should wait the flow of inspiration, or at least the recurrence of elasticity of spirits and relative health of body, will not seem unreasonable to the general reader; but to the inveterate hack-horse of the daily press, accustomed to write at any time, on any subject, and with a rapidity limited only by the physical ability to form the requisite pen-strokes, the notion of waiting for a brighter day, or a happier frame of mind, appears fantastic and absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>He would as soon think of waiting for a change in the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>Hence, while I realized that her contributions evinced rare intellectual wealth and force, I did not value them as I should have done had they been written more fluently and promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>They often seemed to make their appearance <quote>a day after the fair.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> other point of tacit antagonism between us may as well be noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/><persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was always a most earnest, devoted champion of the <name>Emancipation</name> of Women from their past and present condition of inferiority, to an independence of Men. She demanded for them the fullest recognition of Social and Political Equality with the rougher sex; the freest access to all stations, professions, employments, which are open to any. To this demand I heartily acceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>It seemed to me, however, that her clear perceptions of abstract right were often overborne, in practice, by the influence of education and habit; that while she demanded absolute equality for Woman, she exacted a <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> deference and courtesy from men to women, <hi rend="italics">as</hi> women, which was entirely inconsistent with that requirement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>In my view, the equalizing theory can be enforced only by ignoring the habitual discrimination of men and women, as forming separate <hi rend="italics">classes</hi>, and regarding all alike as <hi rend="italics">simply persons</hi>,&mdash;as human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>So long as a lady shall deem herself in need of some gentleman's arm to conduct her properly out of a dining or ball-room,&mdash;so long as she shall consider it dangerous or unbecoming to walk half a mile alone by night, &mdash;I cannot see how the <q direct="unspecified">Woman's Rights</q> theory is ever to be anything more than a logically defensible abstraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>In this view <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> did not at all concur, and the diversity was the incitement to much perfectly good-natured, but nevertheless sharpish sparring between us. Whenever she said or did anything implying the usual demand of Woman on the courtesy and protection of Manhood, I was apt, before complying, to look her in the face and exclaim with marked emphasis,&mdash;quoting from her <quote> Woman in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century,</quote> &mdash; <quote>let them be sea-Captains if they will!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>Of course, this was given and received as raillery, but it did not tend to ripen our intimacy or quicken my esteem into admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>Though no unkind word ever passed between us, nor any approach to <num value="1">one</num>, yet we <num value="2">two</num> dwelt for months under the same roof, as scarcely more than acquaintances, meeting once a day at a common board, and having certain business relations with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>Personally, I regarded her rather as my wife's cherished friend than as my own, possessing many lofty qualities and some prominent weaknesses, and a good deal spoiled by the unmeasured flattery of her little circle of inordinate admirers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>For myself, burning no incense on any human shrine, I half-consciously resolved to <quote> keep my eye-beam clear,</quote> and escape the fascination which she seemed to exert over the eminent and cultivated persons, mainly women, who came to our out-of-the-way dwelling to visit her, and who seemed generally to regard her with a strangely <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> adoration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/></p> 
<p>But as time wore on, and I became inevitably better and better acquainted with her, I found myself drawn, almost irresistibly, into the general current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>I found that her faults and weaknesses were all superficial and obvious to the most casual, if undazzled, observer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>They rather dwindled than expanded upon a fuller knowledge; or rather, took on new and brighter aspects in the light of her radiant and lofty soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>I learned to know her as a most fearless and unselfish champion of Truth and Human Good at all hazards, ready to be their standard-bearer through danger and obloquy, and if need be, their martyr.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>I think few have more keenly appreciated the material goods of life,&mdash;Rank, Riches, Power, Luxury, Enjoyment; but I know none who would have more cheerfully surrendered them all, if the well-being of our Race could thereby have been promoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>I have never met another in whom the inspiring hope of Immortality was so strengthened into profoundest conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>She did not <hi rend="italics">believe</hi> in our future and unending existence,&mdash; she <hi rend="italics">knew</hi> it, and lived ever in the broad glare of its morning twilight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>With <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> a limited income and liberal wants, she was yet generous beyond the bounds of reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>Had the gold of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> been all her own, she would have disbursed <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of it in eager and well-directed efforts to stay, or at least diminish, the flood of human misery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>And it is but fair to state, that the liberality she evinced was fully paralleled by the liberality she experienced at the hands of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>Had she needed <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and made her wants known, she had friends who would have cheerfully supplied her. I think few persons, in their pecuniary dealings, have experienced and evinced more of the better qualities of human nature than <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0218.0020.00259.00999" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>She seemed to inspire those who approached her with that generosity which was a part of her nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/></p> 
<p>Of her writings I do not propose to speak critically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>I think most of her contributions to the <name>Tribune</name>, while she remained with us, were characterized by a directness, terseness, and practicality, which are wanting in some of her earlier productions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>Good judges have confirmed my own opinion, that while her essays in the <name>Dial</name> are more elaborate and ambitious, her reviews in the <name>Tribune</name> are far better adapted to win the favor and sway the judgment of the great majority of readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>But, <num value="1">one</num> characteristic of her writings I feel bound to commend,&mdash;their absolute truthfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>Many of these amounts struck me as excessive, and I tried to recollect if any publication of all the allowances in a like case had ever beer, made through the journals, but could not remember any such publicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4077"/>On inquiry, I was informed that the amounts <hi rend="italics">were</hi> regularly published in a certain document entitled <quote> The Public Accounts,</quote> of which no considerable number was printed, and which was obviously not intended for popular distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/></p> 
<p>But how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>To have picked out a few of what seemed to me the most flagrant cases of overcharge, and print these alone, would be to invite and secure the reputation of partiality, partisanship, and personal animosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>No other course seemed so fair as to print the mileage of each member, with necessary elucidations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>I accordingly employed an ex-clerk in <num value="1">one</num> of the departments, and instructed him to make out a tabular expose as follows:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>I voted against agreeing to that item of the report of the <orgName n="Whole Committee" type="committee">Committee of the Whole</orgName> in favor of the <name>Deficiency</name> bill, and, the item prevailing, I voted against the whole bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>I tried to be against them at every opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>I certainly never meant to do so, and I did all in my power in the <rs type="place">House</rs> to defeat this appropriation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>The subsequent history of the spiritual movement is well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>It has caused much pain, and harm, and loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>But, like every other Event, its good results, realized and prospective, are greater far than its evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>It has awakened some from the insanity of indifference, to the insanity of an exclusive devotion to things spiritual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>But many spiritualists have stopped short of the latter insanity, and are better men, in every respect, than they were&mdash;better, happier, and more hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>It has delivered many from the degrading fear of death and the future, a fear more prevalent, perhaps, than is supposed; for men are naturally and justly ashamed of their fears, and do not willingly tell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/>Spiritualism, moreover, may be among the means by which the way is to be prepared for that general, that earnest, that fearless consideration of our religious systems to which they will, <num value="1">one</num> day, be subjected, and from which the truth in them has nothing to fear, but how much to hope I</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>It was about the same time that the <name>Tribune</name> rendered another service to the country, by publishing a fair and full report of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Woman's Convention, accompanying the report with respectful and favorable remarks.

But when a sincere republican is asked to say in sober earnest what adequate reason he can give for refusing the demand of women to an equal participation with men in political rights, he must answer, None at all. True, he may say that he believes it unwise in them to make the demand&mdash;he may say the great majority desire no such thing; that they prefer to devote their time to <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> the discharge of home duties and the enjoyment of home delights, leaving the functions of legislators, sheriffs, jurymen, militia, to their fathers, husbands, brothers; yet if, after all, the question recurs, <quote>But suppose the women <hi rend="italics">should</hi> generally prefer a complete political equality with men, what would you say to that demand?</quote> &mdash;the answer must be, <quote>accede to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4578"/></q> </p> 
<p>The report of this convention excited much discussion and more ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4579"/>The ridicule has died away, but the discussion of the subject of woman's rights and wrongs will probably continue until every statute which does wrong to woman is expunged from the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4583"/>It was but natural that workingmen should reply, as they often did,&mdash; <quote>If Association is the right principle on which to conduct business, if it is best, safest, and most just to all concerned, why not try it yourself, O Tribune of the <name>People</name>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4584"/>That was precisely what the <name>Tribune</name> of the <name>People</name> had long meditated, and, in the year <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, he and his partner resolved to make the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4585"/>They were both, at the time, in the enjoyment of incomes superfluously large, and the contemplated change in their business was, therefore, not induced by any business exigency.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>The property was divided into a <num value="100">hundred</num> shares of a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> each, and a few of them were offered for sale to the leading men in each department, the foremen of the composing and pressrooms, the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Clerk">chief clerks</rs> and bookkeepers, the most prominent editors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4596"/>In some cases, the purchasers paid only a part of the price in cash, and were allowed to pay the remainder out of the income of their share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4597"/>Each share entitled its possessor to <num value="1">one</num> vote in the decisions of the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4598"/>In the course of time, further sales of shares took place, until the original proprietors were owners of not more than <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>Practically, the power, the controlling voice, belonged still to <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0025.00325.01334" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> and <persName n="McElrath,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0025.00325.01335" reg="mostcommon:McElrath,Thomas,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>McElrath</surname></persName>; but the dignity and advantage of ownership were conferred on all those who exercised authority in the several departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>In large cities, the lecturer has to contend with rival attractions, theatre, concert, and opera.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>His performance is subject to a comparison with the sermons of distinguished clergymen, of which some are of a quality that no lecture surpasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>To know the importance of the popular lecturer, <num value="1">one</num> must reside in a country town the even tenor of whose way is seldom broken by an event of comhanding <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>The arrival of the great man is expected with eagerness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4660"/>A committee of the village magnates meet him at the cars and escort him to his lodging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4661"/>There has been contention who should be his entertainer, and the owner of the best house has carried off the prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/>He is introduced to half the adult population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>There is a buzz and an agitation throughout the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>There is talk of the distinguished visitor at all the tea-tables, in the stores, and across the palings of garden-fences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>The largest church is generally the scene of his triumph, and it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>The words of the stranger are listened to with attentive admiration, and the impression they make is not obliterated by the recurrence of a new excitement on the morrow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>Not so in the city, the hurrying, tumultuous city, where the reappearance of <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName> in all his glory, preceded by Dodworth's band, would serve as the leading feature of the newspapers for <num value="1">one</num> day, give occasion for a few depreciatory articles on the next, and be swept from remembrance by a new astonishment on the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>Yet, as we are here, let us go to the <name>Tabernacle</name> and hear <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0026.00329.01356" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> lecture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/>The Tabernacle, otherwise called <quote>The <rs>Cave</rs>,</quote> is a church which looks as little like an ecclesiastical edifice as can be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>It is a large, circular building, with a floor slanting towards the platform&mdash;pulpit it has none&mdash;and galleries that rise, rank above rank, nearly to the ceiling, which is supported by <num value="6">six</num> thick, smooth columns, that stand round what has been impiously styled the <quote>pit,</quote> like giant spectators of a pigmy show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>The platform is so placed, that the speaker stands not far from the centre of the building, where he seems engulfed in a sea of audience, that swells and surges all around and far above him. A better place for an oratorical display the city does not afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>It received its cavernous nickname, merely in derision of the economical expenditure of gas that its proprietors venture upon when they let the building for an evening entertainment; and the dismal hue of the walls and columns gives further propriety to the epithet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>The Tabernacle will contain an audience of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>At present, there are not more than <num value="6">six</num> speakers and speakeresses in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> who can <quote>draw</quote> it full; and of these, <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0026.00329.01357" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is not <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>His number is about <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>Let us suppose it <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time>, and the <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> arrived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>The audience, we observe, has decidedly the air of a country audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>Fine ladies and fine gentlemen there are none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>Of farmers who look as if they took the <rs>Weekly Tribune</rs> and are in town tonight by accident, there are hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>City mechanics are present in considerable numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>An ardent-looking young man, with a spacious forehead and a turn-over <rs n="shirt collar" type="product">shirt-collar</rs>, may be seen here and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>A few ladies in <persName n="Bloomer,,,,," id="n0218.0026.00330.01358" reg="mostcommon:Bloomer,nomatch:0"><surname>Bloomer</surname></persName> costume of surpassing ugliness&mdash; the costume, not the ladies&mdash;come down the steep aisles now and then, with a well-preserved air of unconsciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>In <hi rend="italics">that</hi> assembly no <num value="1">one</num> laughs at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>The audience is sturdy, solid-looking, appreciative and opinionative, ready for broad views and broad humor, and hard hits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>Every <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> man is reading a newspaper, for they are men of progress, and must make haste to keep up with the times, and the times are fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>Men are going about offering books for sale&mdash;perhaps <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, perhaps a treatise on Water Cure, and perhaps <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0026.00330.01359" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s Hints toward Reforms; but certainly something which belongs to the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>A good many free and independent citizens keep their hats on, and some <quote>speak right out in meeting,</quote> as they converse with their neighbors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>But the lecturer enters at the little door under the gallery on the right, and when the applause apprizes us of the fact, we catch a glimpse of his bald head and sweet face as he wags his hasty way to tile platform, escorted by a few special adherents of the <q direct="unspecified">Cause</q> he is about to advocate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>The newspapers, the hats, the conversation, the book-selling are discontinued, and silent attention is the order of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>People with <q direct="unspecified">causes</q> at their hearts are full of business, and on such occasions there are always some preliminary announcements to be made&mdash;of lectures to come, of meetings to be held, of articles to appear, of days to celebrate, of subscriptions to be undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>These over, the lecturer rises, takes his place at the desk, and, while the applause, which never fails on any public occasion to greet this man, continues, he opens his lecture, puts on his spectacles, and then, looking up at the audience with an expression of inquiring benignity, waits to begin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>Generally, <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0026.00330.01360" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s attire is in a condition of the most hopeless, <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> and, as it were, elaborate disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>It would be applauded on the stare as an excellent <quote>make-up.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>His dress, it is true, is never unclean, and seldom unsound; but he usually presents the appearance of a man who has been traveling, night and day, for <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> in a stage-coach, stopping long enough for an occasional hasty ablution, and a hurried throwing on of clean linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>It must be admitted, however, that when he is going to deliver a set lecture to a city audience his apparel does bear marks of an attempted adjustment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>But it is the attempt of a man who does something to which he is. unaccustomed, and the result is sometimes more surprising than the neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>On the present occasion, the lecturer, as he stands there waiting for the noise to subside, has the air of a farmer, not in his <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> clothes, but in that intermediate rig, once his <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> suit, in which he attends <q direct="unspecified">the meeting of the trustees,</q> announced last Sunday at church, and which he dons to attend court when a cause is coming on that he is interested in. A most respectable man; but the tie of his neckerchief was executed in a fit of abstraction, without the aid of a <rs n="looking glass" type="product">looking-glass</rs>; perhaps in the dark, when he dressed himself this morning before <hi rend="italics">day-light&mdash;to</hi> adopt his own emphasis.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>Silence is restored, and the lecture begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>The voice of the speaker is more like a woman's than a man's, high-pitched, small, soft, but heard with ease in the remotest part of the <name>Tabernacle</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words are apologetic; they are uttered in a deprecatory, slightly-beseeching tone; and their substance is, <quote>You mustn't, my friends, expect fine words from a rough, busy man like me; yet such observations as I have been able hastily to note down, I will now submit, though wishing an abler man stood at this moment in my shoes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>He proceeds to read his discourse in a plain, utterly unambitious, somewhat too rapid manner, pushing on through any moderate degree of applause without waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>If there is a man in the world who is more un-oratorical than any other&mdash;and of course there <hi rend="italics">is</hi> such a man&mdash;and if that man be not <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0026.00331.01361" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, I know not where he is to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>A plain man reading plain sense to plain men; a practical man stating quietly, to practical men the results of his thought and observation, stating what he entirely believes, what he wants the world to believe, what he knows will not be generally believed in his time, what he is quite sure will <num value="1">one</num> day <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> be universally believed, and what he is perfectly patient with the world for not believing <hi rend="italics">yet</hi>. There is no gesticulation, no increased animation at important passages, no glow got up for the closing paragraphs; no aiming at any sort of effect whatever; no warmth of personal feeling against opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>There is a shrewd humor in the man, however, and his hits excite occasional bursts of laughter; but there is no bitterness in his humor, not the faintest approach to it. An impressive or pathetic passage now and then, which loses none of its effect from the simple, plaintive way in which it is uttered, deepens the silence which prevails in the hall, at the end eliciting warm and general applause, which the speaker <q direct="unspecified">improves</q> by drinking a little water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>The attention of the audience never flags, and the lecture concludes amid the usual tokens of decided approbation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/><persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0026.00332.01362" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is, indeed, no orator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>Yet some who value oratory less than any other kind of bodily labor, and whom the tricks of elocution offend, except when they are performed on the stage, and even there they should be concealed, have expressed the opinion that <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0026.00332.01363" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is, strictly speaking, <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend="italics">best</hi> speakers this metropolis can boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>A man, they say, never does a weaker, an unworthier, a more self-demoralizing thing than when he speaks for effect; and of this vice <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> is less guilty than any speaker we are in the habit of hearing, except <persName n="Emerson,,Ralph,Waldo,," id="n0218.0026.00332.01364" reg="default:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><foreName>Ralph</foreName> <foreName>Waldo</foreName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>Not that he does not make exaggerated statements; not that he does not utter sentiments which are only half true; not that he does not sometimes indulge in language which, when <hi rend="italics">read</hi>, savor of the high-flown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>What I mean is, that his public speeches are literally transcripts of the mind whence they emanate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>At public meetings and public dinners <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0026.00332.01365" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is a frequent speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>The call is never declined; nor does he ever speak without saying something; and when ho has said it he resumes his seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>He has a way, particularly of late years, of coming to a meeting when it is nearly over, delivering <num value="1">one</num> of his short, enlightening addresses, and then embracing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity that offers of taking an unobserved departure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4737"/>The preface informs us, that the lectures were prompted by invitations to address Popular Lyceums and Young Men's Associations, <quote>generally those of the humbler class,</quote> existing in country villages and rural townships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4739"/>A calling whose exactions are seldom intermitted for a day, never for a longer period, and whose requirements, already excessive, seem perpetually to expand and increase, may well excuse the distraction of thought and rapidity of composition which it renders inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/>Trace his history closely,</q> he continues, <q direct="unspecified">and you find that, in his boyhood, he was provident and frugal&mdash;that he shunned expense and dissipation&mdash;that he feasted and quaffed seldom, <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> unless at others' cost&mdash;that he was rarely seen at balls or frolics&mdash;that he was diligent in study and in business&mdash;that he did not hesitate to do an incompatible job, if it bade fair to be profitable&mdash;that he husbanded his hours and made each count <num value="1">one</num>, either in earning or in preparing to work efficiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>He rarely or never stood idle because the business offered him was esteemed ungenteel or disagreeable&mdash;he laid up a few dollars during his minority, which proved a sensible help to him on going into business for himself&mdash;he married seasonably, prudently, respectably&mdash;he lived frugally and delved steadily until it clearly became him to live better, and until he could employ his time to better advantage than at the plow or over the bench.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> if not most important movement to be made in advance of our present Social position is the <name>Organization</name> of Labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>This is to be effected by degrees, by steps, by installments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/>I propose here, in place of setting forth any formal theory or system of Labor Reform, simply to narrate what I saw and heard of the history and state of an experiment now in progress near <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, and which differs in no material respects from some dozen or score of others already commenced in various parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, not to speak of <num value="20">twenty</num> times as many established by the <rs>Working Men</rs> of <placeName reg="Paris, Edgar, Illinois" key="tgn,2029573">Paris</placeName> and other portions of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.</p>

<p>The business of iron-Molding, casting, or whatever it may be called, <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most extensive and thrifty of the manufactures of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, and I believe the labor employed therein is quite as well rewarded as Labor generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>It is entirely paid by the piece, according to an established scale of prices, so that each workman, in whatever department of the business, is paid according to his individual skill and industry, not a rough average of what is supposed to be earned by himself and others, as is the case where work is paid for at so much per day, week or month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>I know no reason why the <rs>Iron-Molders</rs> of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> should not have been as well satisfied with the old ways as anybody else.</p>

<p>Yet the system did not <quote>work well,</quote> even for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>Beyond the general unsteadiness of demand for Labor and the ever-increasing pressure of competition, there was a pretty steadily recurring <quote>dull season,</quote> commencing about the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, when the <rs>Winter</rs>'s call for stoves, &amp;c., had been supplied, and holding on for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, or until the <rs type="place">Spring</rs> business opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>In this hiatus, the prior savings of the <name>Molder</name> were generally consumed&mdash;sometimes less, but perhaps oftener more&mdash;so that, taking <num value="1">one</num> with another, they did not lay up <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>By-and-by came a collision respecting wages and a <quote>strike,</quote> wherein the <name>Journeymen</name> tried the experiment of running their heads against a stone wall for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>How they came out of it, no matter whether victors or vanquished, the intelligent reader will readily guess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>I never heard of any evils so serious and complicated as those which eat out the heart of Labor being cured by doing nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/>There were about <num value="20">twenty</num> of them who put their hands to the work, and the whole amount of capital they could scrape together was <measure n="2100dollars" type="currency">two thousand one hundred dollars</measure>, held in shares of <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>With this they purchased an eligible piece of ground, directly on the bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName></placeName>, with which <quote> the <rs type="place">Whitewater Canal</rs></quote> also affords the means of ready and cheap communication, With their capital they bought some patterns, flasks, an engine and tools, paid for their ground, and <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> on their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> building, which was erected for them partly on long credit by a firm in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, who knew that the property was a perfect security for so much of its cost, and decline taking credit for any benevolence in the matter Their iron, coal, &amp;c., to commence upon were entirely and necessarily bought on credit.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>Its accommodations were then meager; they have since been gradually enlarged by additions, until their Foundry is now the most commodious on the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>Their stock of patterns, flasks, &amp;c., has grown to be <num value="1">one</num> of the best; while their arrangements for unloading coal and iron, sending off stoves, coking coal, &amp;c., &amp;c., are almost perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>They commenced with <num value="10">ten</num> associates actually at work; the number has gradually grown to <num value="40">forty</num>; and there is not a better set of workmen in any foundry in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>And there is obvious reason for this in the fact that every workman is a proprietor in the concern, and it is his interest to turn out not only his own work in the best order, but to take care that all the rest is of like quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>All is carefully examined before it is sent away, and any found imperfect is condemned, the loss falling on the causer of it. But there is seldom any deserving condemnation.</p>

<p>A strict account is kept with every member, who is credited for all he does according to the <rs>Cincinnati Scale</rs> of Prices, paid so much as he needs of his earnings in money, the balance being devoted to the extension of the concern and the payment of its debts, and new stock issued to him therefor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>Whenever the debts shall have been paid off, and an adequate supply of implements, teams, stock, &amp;c., bought or provided for, they expect to pay every man his earnings weekly in cash, as of course they may.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>An advertisement is worth but a certain amount, and the public soon get to know what it is worth; you put a duty on advertisements and you destroy the value of those coming to new establishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>People who advertise in your well-established journals, could afford to pay a price to include the duty; but in a new paper, the advertisements <pb id="p.356" n="356"/> would not be worth the amount of the duty <hi rend="italics">alone</hi>; and consequently the new concern would have no chance Now, the advertisements are <num value="1">one</num> main source of the income of daily papers, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of business men take them mainly for those advertisements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5206"/>But the road was hard, the coach a little the uneasiest I ever hardened my bones upon, and my slumber was of a disturbed and dubious character, a dim sense of physical discomfort shaping and coloring my incoherent and fitful visions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>It enlarged its borders to such an extent that the price of subscription did not quite cover the cost of the white paper upon which it was printed, thus throwing the burden of its support upon the advertiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>And this, too, in the face of the fact that the <name>Tribune</name>, though the best vehicle of advertising then in existence, was in least favor among the class whose advertising is the most profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5520"/></p> 
<p>Let me begin by frankly stating that I am not engaged in the slave trade, and do not now contemplate embarking in that business; but no man can say confidently what he may or may not become; and, if I ever <hi rend="italics">should</hi> engage in the traffic you suggest, it will be but fair to remember you as among my prompters to undertake it. Yet even then I must decline any such examination as you proffer of the property you wish to dispose of.

<p>You will see that I have disregarded your request that your name and residence should be suppressed by me. That request seems to me inspired by <pb id="p.389" n="389"/> a modesty and self-sacrifice unsuited to the <name>Age</name> of Brass we live in. Are you not seeking to do a humane and generous act?

<p>I cannot now remember that I have ever heard Slavery justified on any ground which did not assert or imply that <hi rend="italics">it is the best condition for the negro</hi>. The blacks, we are daily told, cannot take care of themselves, but sink into idleness, debauchery, squalid poverty and utter brutality, the moment the master's sustaining rule and care are withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5532"/>If this is true, how dare you turn this poor dependent, for whose well-being you are responsible, over to me, who neither would nor could exert a master's control over her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5533"/>If this slave ought not to be set at liberty, why do you ask me to bribe you with <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> to do her that wrong?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5534"/>If she ought to be, why should I pay you <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> for doing your duty in the premises?

<p>Full as your account of this girl is, you say nothing of her children though such she undoubtedly has whether they be also those of her several masters, as she was, or their fathers were her fellow-slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5542"/>I think and trust you misapprehend them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5543"/>For though they have, to my certain knowledge, under the impulse of special appeals to their sympathies, and in view of peculiar dangers or hard-ships, paid a great deal more money than they could comfortably spare (few of them being rich) to buy individual slaves out of bondage, yet their judgment <pb id="p.390" n="390"/> has never approved such payment of tribute to man-thieves, and every day's <hi rend="italics">earnest</hi> consideration causes it to be regarded with less and less favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5544"/>For it is not the snatching of hand and there a person from Slavery, at the possible rate of <num value="1">one</num> for every <num value="1000">thousand</num> increase of our slave population, that they desire, but the overthrow and extermination of <hi rend="italics">the slave-holding system</hi>; and this end, they realize, is rather hindered than helped by their buying here and there a slave into freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5545"/>If by so buying <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> a year, at a cost of <num value="10000000">Ten Millions</num> of Dollars, they should confirm you and other slaveholders in the misconception that Slavery is regarded without abhorrence by intelligent <name>Christian</name> freemen at the <rs>North</rs>, they would be doing great harm to their cause and injury to their fellow-Christians in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5554"/>We are in the streets, walking from the regions where money is spent towards those narrow and crooked places wherein it is earned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5555"/>The day is about to dawn, but the street lights are still burning, and the greater part of the <num value="1000000">million</num> people who live within sight of the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>'s illuminated dial, are lying horizontal and unconscious, in the morning's last slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5556"/>The streets are neither silent nor deserted&mdash;the streets of New York never are. The earliest milkmen have begun their morning crow, squeak, whoop, and yell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5557"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> omnibus has not yet come down town, but the butcher's carts, heaped with horrid flesh, with men sitting upon it reeking with a night's carnage, are rattling along <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> at the furious pace for which the butcher's carts of all nations are noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5558"/>The earliest workmen are abroad, dinner-kettle in hand; carriers with their bundles of newspapers slung across their backs by a strap, are emerging from <address><street n="Nassau street">Nassau street</street></address>, and making their way across the <rs>Park</rs>&mdash;towards all the ferries&mdash;up <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>&mdash;up <address><street n="Chatham street">Chatham street</street></address>&mdash;to wherever their district of distribution begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5559"/>The hotels have just opened their doors and lighted up their offices; and drowsy waiters are perambulating the interminable passages, knocking up passengers for the early trains, and waking up everybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5560"/>In unnumbered kitchens the breakfast fire is kindling, but not yet, in any except the market restaurants, is a cup of coffee attainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/>The very groggeries&mdash;strange to see&mdash;are closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/>Apparently, the <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> last drunkard has toppled home, and the last debauchee has skulked like a thieving hound to his own bed; for the wickedness of the night has been done, and the work of the day is beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>There is something in the aspect of the city at this hour&mdash;the stars glittering over-head&mdash;the long lines of <rs n="gas lights" type="product">gas-lights</rs> that stretch away in every direction &mdash; the few wayfarers stealing in and out among them in silence, like spirits&mdash;the myriad sign-boards so staring now, and useless&mdash;the houses all magnified in the imperfect light&mdash;so many evidences of intense life around, and yet so little of life visibly present&mdash;which, to <num value="1">one</num> who sees it for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time (and few of us have ever seen it), is strangely impressive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5564"/>The <rs type="place">Tribune building</rs> is before us. It looks as we never saw it look before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5565"/>The office is closed, and a <rs n="Gas Light" type="newspaper">gas-light</rs> dimly burning shows that no <num value="1">one</num> is in it. The dismal inky aperture in <address><street n="Spruce street">Spruce street</street></address> by which the upper regions of the <name>Tribune</name> den are usually reached is shut, and the door is locked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5566"/>That glare of light which on all previous nocturnal walks we have seen illuminating the windows of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> stories, revealing the bobbing compositor in his paper cap, and the bustling night-editor making up his news, shines not at this hour; and those windows are undistinguished from the lustreless ones of the houses adjacent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5567"/>Coiled up on the steps, stretched out on the pavement, are half a dozen sleeping newsboys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5568"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> others are awake and up, of whom <num value="1">one</num> is devising and putting into practice various modes of suddenly waking the sleepers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5569"/>He rolls <num value="1">one</num> off the step to the pavement, the shock of which is very effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5570"/>He deals another who lies temptingly exposed, a <quote>loud-resounding</quote> slap, which brings the slumberer to his feet, and to his fists, in an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5571"/>Into the ear of <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> he yells the magic word <hi rend="italics">Fire</hi>, a word which the New York newsboy never hears with indifference; the sleeper starts up, but perceiving the trick, growls a curse or <num value="2">two</num>, and addresses himself again to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>In a few minutes all the boys are awake, and taking their morning exercise of scuffling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>The basement of the building, we observe, is all a-glow with light, though the clanking of the press is silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/>The carrier's entrance is open, and we descend into the fiery bowels of the street.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/>We are in the <rs>Tribune</rs>'s press-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>It is a large, low, ceilar-like apartment, unceiled, white-washed, inky, and unclean, with a vast <pb id="p.393" n="393"/> folding table in the middle, tall heaps of dampened paper all about, a quietly-running steam engine of <measure n="9horsepower">nine-horse power</measure> on <num value="1">one</num> side, <num value="25">twenty-five</num> inky men and boys variously employed, and the whole brilliantly lighted up by jets of gas, numerous and flaring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>On <num value="1">one</num> side is a kind of desk or pulpit, with a table before it, and the whole separated from the rest of the apartment by a rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>In the pulpit, the night-clerk stands, counts and serves out the papers, with a nonchalant and graceful rapidity, that must be seen to be appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/>The regular carriers were all served an hour ago; they have folded their papers and gone their several ways; and early risers, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> off, have already read the news of the day. The later newsboys, now, keep dropping in, singly, or in squads of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num>, each with his money ready in his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>Usually, no words pass between them and the clerk; he either knows how many papers they have come for, or they show him by exhibiting their money; and in <measure n="3seconds" type="date">three seconds</measure> after his eye lights upon a newly-arrived dirty face, he has counted the requisite number of papers, counted the money for them, and thrown the papers in a heap into the boy's arms, who slings them over his shoulder and hurries off for his supply of <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Heralds</hi>. Occasionally a woman comes in for a few papers, or a little girl, or a boy so small that he cannot see over the low rail in front of the clerk, and is obliged to announce his presence and his desires by holding above it his little cash capital in his little black paw. In another part of the pressroom, a dozen or <num value="15">fifteen</num> boys are folding papers for the early mails, and folding them at the average rate of <num value="30">thirty</num> a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5581"/>A boy <hi rend="italics">has</hi> folded <num value="60">sixty</num> papers a minute in that press-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5582"/>Each paper has to be folded <num value="6">six</num> times, and then laid evenly on the pile; and the velocity of movement required for the performance of such a minute's work, the reader can have no idea of till he sees it done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5583"/>As a feat, nothing known to the sporting world approaches it. The huge presses, that shed <num value="6">six</num> printed leaves at a stroke, are in deep vaults adjoining the press-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5584"/>They are motionless now, but the gas that has lighted them during their morning's work still spurts out in flame all over them, and men with blue shirts and black faces are hoisting out the <q direct="unspecified">forms</q> that have stamped their story on <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> sheets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5585"/>The vaults are oily, inky, and warm.

<p>The day has dawned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5588"/>As we approach the stairs that lead to the upper stories, we get a peep into a small, paved yard, where a group of pressmen, blue-overailed, ink-smeared, and pale, are washing themselves and the ink-rollers; and looking, in the dim light of the morning, like writhing devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5589"/>The stairs of the <rs type="place">Tribune building</rs> are supposed to be the dirtiest in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>By their assistance, however, we wind our upward way, past the editorial rooms in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, which are locked, to the composing-room in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, which are open, and in which the labor of transposing the news of the morning to the form of the weekly paper is in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>Only <num value="2">two</num> men are present, the foreman, <persName n="Rooker,Mister,,,," id="n0218.0029.00394.01640" reg="nearbymention:Rooker,Thomas,N.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rooker</surname></persName>, and <num value="1">one</num> of his assistants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>Neither of them wish to be spoken to, as their minds are occupied with a task that requires care; but we are at liberty to look around.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5596"/>Stuffed into corners and interstices are aprons and slippers in curious variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5597"/>Pasted on the walls, lamp-shades, and doors, we observe a number of printed notices, from the perusal of which, aided by an occasional word from the obliging foreman, we are enabled to penetrate the mystery, and comprehend the routine, of the place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5598"/>Here, for example, near the middle of the apartment, are a row of hooks, labelled respectively, <quote>Leaded <persName n="Brevier,,,,," id="n0218.0029.00394.01641" reg="mostcommon:Brevier,nomatch:0"><surname>Brevier</surname></persName>;</quote> <quote>Solid <persName n="Brevier,,,,," id="n0218.0029.00394.01642" reg="mostcommon:Brevier,nomatch:0"><surname>Brevier</surname></persName>;</quote> <quote>Minion;</quote> Proofs to revise; <quote> </quote> Compositors' Proofs&mdash;let no profane hand touch them except <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0218.0029.00394.01643" reg="mostcommon:Smith,John,,,:5"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s; <quote> Bogus minion&mdash;when there is no other copy to be given out, then take from this hook.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5599"/>Upon these hooks, the foreman hangs the <quote>copy</quote> as he receives it from below, and the men take it in turn, requiring no further direction as to the kind of type into which it is to be set.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5686"/>The Tribune, from the beginning of its career, has kept a vigilant eye upon passing literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>Its judgments have great weight with the reading public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5688"/>They are always pronounced with, at least, an air of deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5689"/>They are always able, generally just, occasionally cruel, more frequently too kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5690"/>In this department, taking into account the quantity of information given&mdash;both of home and foreign literature, of books published and of books to be published &mdash;and the talent and knowledge displayed in its notices and reviews, the superiority of the <name>Tribune</name> to any existing daily paper is simply undeniable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5691"/>Articles occasionally appear in the <rs>London</rs> journals, written <hi rend="italics">after</hi> every other paper has expressed its judgment, written at ample leisure and by men pre-eminent in the <num value="1">one</num> branch of letters to which the reviewed book belongs, which are superior to the reviews of the <name>Tribune</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5692"/>It is the literary <hi rend="italics">department</hi> of the paper, <pb id="p.401" n="401"/> for which superiority is here asserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5693"/>To-day, it happens, that the paper contains nothing literary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5694"/>In a daily paper, news has the precedence of everything, and a review of an epic greater than <persName n="Lost,,Paradise,,," id="n0218.0029.00401.01672" reg="default:Lost,Paradise,,,"><foreName>Paradise</foreName> <surname>Lost</surname></persName> might be crowded out by the report of an election brawl in the <orgName type="division" n="Ward 6">Sixth Ward</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5700"/>This is strange, but true.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/>In its <orgName n="Editorial Department" type="department">editorial department</orgName>, the <name>Tribune</name> has <num value="2">two</num> advantages over most of its contemporaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>In the first place, it has an object of attack, the slave power; and secondly, by a long course of warfare, it has won the conceded privilege of being sincere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who has had to do with the press, is aware, that articles in newspapers are of <num value="2">two</num> kinds, namely, those which are written <hi rend="italics">for a purpose</hi> not avowed, and those which are written spontaneously, from the impulse and convictions of the writer's own mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>And any <num value="1">one</num> who has written articles of both descriptions is aware, further, that a man who is writing with perfect sincerity, writing with a pure desire to move, interest, or convince, writes <hi rend="italics">better</hi>, than when the necessities of his vocation compel him to <hi rend="italics">grind the axe</hi> for a party, or an individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>There is more or less of axe-grinding done in every newspaper office in the world; and a perfectly independent newspaper never existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5706"/>Take, for example, the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London Times</orgName>, which is claimed to be the most incorruptible of journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5707"/>The writers for the <rs>Times</rs> are trammeled, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, by the immense <hi rend="italics">position</hi> of the paper, which give to its leading articles a possible influence upon the affairs of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5708"/>The aim of the writer is to express, not himself, but <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; as the <rs>Times</rs> is, in other countries, the <pb id="p.402" n="402"/> recognized voice of the <rs>British Empire</rs>; and it is this which renders much of the writing in the <rs>Times</rs> as safe, as vague, and as pointless, as a diplomatist's dispatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5709"/>The Times is further trammeled by the business necessity of keeping on terms with those who have it in their power to give and withhold important intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5710"/>And, still further, by the fact, that <hi rend="italics"><persName n="England,General,,,," id="n0218.0029.00402.01673" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">general</roleName> <surname>England</surname></persName></hi>, whom it addresses, is not up to the liberality of the age&mdash;in which the leading minds alone fully participates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5711"/>Thus, it happens, that the articles in a paper like The Leader, which reaches only the liberal class, are often more pointed, more vigorous, more interesting, than those of the <rs>Times</rs>, though the resources of the <name>Leader</name> are extremely limited, and the <rs>Times</rs> can have its pick of the wit, talent, and learning of the empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5712"/>When a man writes with perfect freedom, then, and only then, he writes his <hi rend="italics">best</hi>. Without claiming for the <name>Tribune</name> a perfect innocence of axe-grinding, it may with truth be sail, that the power of its leading editorial articles is vastly increased by the fact, that those who write them, do so with as near an approach to perfect freedom, <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>. sincerity, as the nature of newspaper-writing, at present, admits of. What it gains, too, in spirit and interest by having the preposterous inaptitude of the <rs>Southern</rs> press to ridicule, and the horrors of Southern brutality to denounce, is sufficiently known.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>The press-room on <date value="--4">Thursdays</date> does its utmost, and presents a scene of bustle and movement <quote>easier imagined than described.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>No small amount of work, too, is done in the office of publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>To-day, as we ascertain, <num value="213">two hundred and thirteen</num> business letters were received, containing, among other things less interesting, <measure n="1172dollars" type="currency">eleven hundred and seventy-two dollars</measure>, and <num value="410">four hundred and ten</num> new or renewed subscriptions, each of which has been recorded and placed upon the wrapper-writer's books.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>It is <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>Gas has resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>The clank of the press has ceased, and the basement is dimly lighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>The clerks, who have been so busy all day, have gone home, and the night-clerk, whom we saw this morning in his press-room pulpit, is now behind the counter of the office receiving advertisements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>Night-work agrees with him, apparently, for he is robust, ruddy and smiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>Aloft in the composing room, <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> men are setting type, silently and fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>No sound is heard but the click of the type, or the voice, now and then, of a foreman, or the noise of of the copy-box rattling up the wooden pipe from the editor's room below, or a muffled grunt from the tin tube by which the different rooms hold converse with <num value="1">one</num> another, or the bell which calls for <pb id="p.407" n="407"/> the application of an ear to the mouth of that tube.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>The place is warm, close, light, and still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>Whether it is <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> detrimental to a compositor's health to work from <num value="8">eight</num> to <measure n="10hours" type="date">ten hours</measure> every night in such an atmosphere, in such a light, is still, it appears, a question.

The compositors think it is, and seldom feel able to work more than <num value="4">four</num> nights a week, filling their places on the other nights from the list of substitutes, or in printer's language <quote>subs.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>Compositors say, that sleep in the day time is a very different thing from sleep at night, particularly in summer, when to create an artificial night is to exclude the needful air. They say that they never get perfectly used to the reversion of nature's order; and often, after a night of drowsiness so extreme that they would give the world if they could sink down upon the floor and sleep, they go to bed at length, and find that offended <persName n="Morpheus,,,,," id="n0218.0029.00407.01698" reg="mostcommon:Morpheus,nomatch:0"><surname>Morpheus</surname></persName> has taken his flight, and left their eye-lids glued to their brows; and they cannot close them before the inexorable hour arrives that summons them to work again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/>In the middle of the room the principal night-foreman is already <quote>making up</quote> the outside forms of to-morrow's paper, <num value="4">four</num> in number, each a section of a cylinder, with rims of polished iron, and type of copper face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/>It is slow work, and a moment's inattention might produce results more ridiculous than cross-readings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>The editorial rooms, too, have become intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/><num value="7">Seven</num> desks are occupied with silent writers, most of them in the <name>Tribune</name> uniform&mdash;shirt-sleeves and moustache.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>The night-reader is looking over the papers last arrived, with scissors ready for any paragraph of news that catches his eye. An editor occasionally goes to the copy-box, places in it a page or <num value="2">two</num> of the article he is writing, and rings the bell; the box slides up to the composing-room, and the pages are in type and corrected before the article is finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>Such articles are those which are prompted by the event of the hour; others are more deliberately written; some are weeks in preparation; and of some the keel is laid months before they are launched upon the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Editor-in-Chief">Editor-in-Chief</rs> is at his desk writing in a singular attitude, the desk on a level with his nose, and the writer sitting bolt upright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>He writes rapidly, with scarcely a pause for thought, and not once in a page makes an erasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>The foolscap leaves fly firm under his pen at the rate of <num value="1">one</num> in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>. He does <pb id="p.408" n="408"/> most of the <hi rend="italics">thinking</hi> before he begins to write, and produces matter about as fast as a swift copyist can copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>Yet he leaves nothing for the compositor to guess at, and if he makes an alteration in the proof, he is careful to do it in such a way that the printer loses no time in <quote>overrunning;</quote> that is, he inserts as many words as he erases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5799"/>Not unfrequently he bounds up into the composing-room, and makes a correction or adds a sentence with his own hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>He is not patient under the infliction of an error; and he expects men to understand his wishes by intuition; and when they do <hi rend="italics">not</hi>, but interpret his half-expressed orders in a way exactly contrary to his intention, a scene is likely to ensue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5801"/>And so they write and read in the editorial rooms of the <name>Tribune</name> for some hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/>Occasionally a City Reporter comes in with his budget of intelligence, or his short-hand notes, and sits down at a desk to arrange or write them out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>That omnipresent creature, the down-town apple-woman, whom no labyrinth puzzles, no extent of stairs fatigues, no presence overawes, enters, and thrusts her basket in deliberate succession under each editorial nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>Some of the corps, deep in the affairs of the nation, pause in their writing, gaze at the woman in utter abstraction, slowly come to a sense of her errand, shake their heads, and resume their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>Others hurriedly buy an apple, and taking <num value="1">one</num> prodigious bite, lay it aside and forget it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>He has also marked the order in which the articles are to appear; and, having performed this last duty, he returns the list to the compositor, puts on his coat and departs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> phalanx of compositors is dismissed, and they come thundering down the dark stairs, putting on their coats as they descend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/>The foreman is absorbed in making up the inside forms, as he has just sent those of the outside below, and the distant clanking of the press announces that they have begun to be printed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>We descend, and find the sheets coming off the press at the rate of a <num value="160">hundred and sixty</num> a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>The engine-man is commodiously seated on an inverted basket, under a gas-jet, reading the outside of the morning's paper, and the chief of the press-room is scanning a sheet to see if the impression is perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>The gigantic press has <num value="6">six</num> mouths, and <num value="6">six</num> men are feeding him with white paper, slipping in the sheets with the easy knack acquired by long practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>It looks a simple matter, this feeding; but if a new hand were to attempt it, the iron maw of the monster would be instantly choked, and his whole system disarranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>The outside of the paper is printed, the inside forms are ready to be lowered away to the basement, and the press-men are impatiently waiting the signal to receive it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>In a few minutes, the forms are lowered to the basement, wheeled to the side of the press, and hoisted to their places on the press by a crank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>The feeders take their stands, the foreman causes the press to make <num value="1">one</num> revolution, examines a sheet, pronounces it all right, sets the press in motion at a rattling rate, and nothing remains to be done except to print off <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> copies and distribute them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>The last scene of all is a busy <num value="1">one</num> indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/>The carriers receive their papers in the order of the comparative distance of their districts from the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>No money passes between them and the clerk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5838"/>They come to the office every afternoon, examine the book of subscribers, note the changes ordered in their respective routes, pay for the number of papers they will require on the following morning, and receive a ticket entitling them to receive the designated number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5839"/>The number of papers distributed by <num value="1">one</num> carrier varies from <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="500">five hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5840"/>Some of the carriers, however, are assisted by boys As a carrier gains a weekly profit of <measure n="3cents" type="currency">three cents</measure> on each subscriber, <num value="1">one</num> who delivers <num value="500">five hundred</num> papers has an income of <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> a week; and it is well earned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5874"/>And again, he has <quote>endeavored so to elucidate what is just and practical in the demands of our time for a social Renovation, that the humane and philanthropic can no longer misrepresent and malign them as destructive or infidel in their tendencies; but must joyfully recognize in them the fruits of past, and the seeds of future, progress in the history of our race.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5876"/>That a position like this, between <num value="2">two</num> opposing forces, is more apt to excite the hostility of both than the confidence of either, has been frequently shown in the career of <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0030.00413.01715" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5879"/>His opinions on such subjects as religion and politics, which include all others, the reader is acquainted with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6081"/>It was a chilly, disagreeable evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6082"/>I went early, hoping to have a little talk with the editor before other company should arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6083"/>I rang the bell, and looked through the pane at the side of the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/>The white coat was not upon its accustomed peg, and the old hat stuffed with newspapers was not in <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> its usual place at the bottom of the hat-stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6085"/>Therefore I knew that the wearer of these articles was not at home, before the <quote>girl</quote> told me so; but, upon her informing me that he was expected in a few minutes, I concluded to go in and wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6086"/>The entrance-hall is exceedingly narrow, and the stairs, narrower still, begin at a few feet from the door, affording room only for the hat-stand and a chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/>The carpet on the stairs and hall was common in pattern, coarse in texture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>A lady, the very picture of a prosperous farmer's wife, with her clean delaine dress and long, wide, white apron, stood at the head of the stairs, and came down to meet me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>But the walls were almost covered with paintings; the mantelpieces were densely peopled with statuettes, busts, and medallions; in a corner on a pedestal stood a beautiful copy of (I believe) Powers' Proserpine in marble; and various other works of art were disposed about the floor or leaned against the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6092"/>Of the quality of the pictures I could not, in that light, form an opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6093"/>The subjects of more than half of them were religious, such as, the <name>Virgin</name> rapt; <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName>, lovest thou me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/>In alluding to political persons he used the utmost freedom of vituperation, but there was such an evident absence of anger and bitterness on his part, that if the vituperated individuals had overheard the conversation, they would not have been offended, but amused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6279"/>Properly interpreted, this is high, perhaps the highest, praise; for a man who succeeds in doing what he tries to do, must have the sense to choose enterprises suited to his abilities and circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6280"/>This praise, it is true, is frequently given to men whose objects are extremely petty-making a fortune, for example; but if those objects were such as they could attain, if enterprises of a higher nature were really beyond their abilities, how much wiser is it in them to attempt petty objects only!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6281"/>But whatever may be the value of the <rs>American</rs> eulogy&mdash;and a Yankee is an American, only more so&mdash;it may most justly be bestowed upon <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0218.0032.00439.01795" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6295"/>A man whose vocation obliges him frequently to write at the rate of a column an hour, and who must always write with dispatch, can rarely produce literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6296"/>Nor can any man write with faultless accuracy who is acquainted with no language but that in which he writes.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6298"/>His power as a writer arises from his earnestness of conviction, from his intimate acquaintance with the circumstances and feelings of his readers, from his Scotch-<name>Irish</name> fertility in illustration, and from the limited range of his subjects.
