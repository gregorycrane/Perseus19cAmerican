<head>Conclusion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In conclusion of this sketch, which is written purely from recollection, and partly from memoranda made at the time, I deem it not amiss to say in justification of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0269.0002.00004.00031" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s discipline that it was simply the misfortune of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that she had so few officers like him to carry out and enforce her laws, and thereby render her arms what they should have been, efficient and perfect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Captious critics, the most of whom were in the rear, could not appreciate the vital importance of discipline in an army, nor did they stop to reflect that the very laws the operations of which they so much condemned were enacted by their Congressmen chosen by their suffrages, and some of whom, strange to say, united in the clamor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Like the <rs>President</rs>, <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0002.00004.00032" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> was, in <num value="1">one</num> sense of the term, an executive officer, and the law of Congress making it a death penalty to run cotton through the lines had by him, as a good and true officer, to be rigidly enforced, regardless of its propriety in the abstract.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When caught in the act the accused was given the benefit of a trial before a court-martial, and if found guilty, and the proceedings in <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> other respects being regular, he invariably received the punishment awarded.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Concede the applicability of such a test to the relative valor, generalship and military character of the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern armies, during the war, and we <q direct="unspecified">exalt the soldiers of the <rs>North</rs> above all precedent and consign the unequalled valor of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiery to reproach, instead of the deathless fame which shall survive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But while we give all credit to our own troops, let us never again disparage our enemy and call them cowards, for nothing was ever more glorious than their <num value="3">three</num> charges in the face of a raking fire of grape and canister, and then at last, as if to do or die, they broke into <num value="2">two</num> columns and rushed against our right and left flanks, which movement would have gained the day, had not our reinforcements arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We were emphatically surprised, but it could not have been otherwise expected, when we recollect that the <num value="3">three</num> commands before mentioned, which were at <placeName key="tgn,2096672" n="1.000 42" reg="secessionville, charleston, south carolina">Secessionville</placeName>, had been under fire of the enemy's battery for the past <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, being shelled day and night, and thereby almost exhausted from want of sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Many of our finest men were killed, and all the friends or relations of some of the officers in the <rs>Fort</rs>, and a general gloom is spread over the countenances of all here now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>And now I will try and tell you something about our situation on <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James Island</placeName>, as I have had the chance of learning, having in company with some other officers in the <rs>Fort</rs> visited the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> last, the day before the battle, and having seen all our outposts, breastworks, batteries, &amp;c., as well as a large portion of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>A dense woods separates our army from the enemy, and all along for from <num value="3000">3,000</num> to <measure n="4000yards" type="distance">4,000 yards</measure> in rear of these woods, <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., towards our side, is a level, open space, and in most places can only be passed over by the army, on account of marsh-lands, by roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Now, cutting across the island to the rear of this level space, stretch our breastworks, in which we have a few guns mounted at considerable intervals apart, and behind which infantry and field-batteries will be protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>You see at once the strength of our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The roads will be thoroughly guarded, and if a column advances across <num value="1">one</num> of these fields, it will be exposed to the fire of artillery as soon as it makes its appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It can then be raked when nearer by grape and canister, and as soon as it comes within range nothing protects it from the volleys of our infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><placeName key="tgn,2096672" n="1.000 42" reg="secessionville, charleston, south carolina">Secessionville</placeName> is a very important point on the creek that divides <persName n="Morris,,,,," id="n0269.0003.00006.00040" reg="mostcommon:Morris,Mary,Blackburn,,:2"><surname>Morris</surname></persName>'s from <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James's Island</placeName> and constitutes our extreme left flank, and if taken the enemy could turn our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It was for this reason, no doubt, that the attack <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> was made the other day, and for this reason also that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are so determined to hold it. The enemy's gun-boats can come up within shelling distance of it, and to hold their place our troops were obliged to remain there under fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We have about <num value="8000">8,000</num>, or perhaps as many as <num value="10000">10,000</num>, men on the island, and all, I believe in good condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The enemy's force is estimated at <num value="9000">9,000</num>, under <persName n="Stephens,General,,,," id="n0269.0003.00007.00041" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If this is the true estimate it certainly would seem as if we could hold them in check for any length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is about <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles distant</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2096672" n="1.000 42" reg="secessionville, charleston, south carolina">Secessionville</placeName></placeName>, but it seems to me impossible for the enemy's gunboats ever to come from that quarter to attack us, as the stream is only navigable to very small boats, and that, too, only at very high tides.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>While on the island we visited our outposts, and I had the pleasure of seeing, from the top of a tree, the <rs>Yankee</rs> pickets, about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>We stopped at <placeName key="tgn,2096672" n="1.000 42" reg="secessionville, charleston, south carolina">Secessionville</placeName> a few moments, and then, led on by curiosity, rather than by wisdom, we went across an open field under fire, to our battery, <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards distant</measure>, and remained there an hour, looking at the mortar practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The enemy fired very rapidly and with great precision, striking the battery or grazing the top nearly every time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Their shells bursted mostly in rear of us, and only once directly overhead, which <measure n="2" type="wounded">wounded two</measure> men. There were <num value="5">five</num> of us along together, composing our party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It was very unwise of us to have exposed ourselves thus recklessly, and the more so that we should have done so merely out of curiosity.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>He arrived on the <dateStruct value="-12-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and immediately bent all his energies to the almost superhuman task before him: the task of shaping from a starved, ragged, ill-used mob of men, a disciplined command, which in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> time was to be the sole defense, the sole obstacle, against the mighty and splendidly-equipped <orgName>army of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00033.00618" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName></orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>I call his task a superhuman <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;and justly so. The calamity which preceded his arrival, and, indeed, made his presence necessary, was <num value="1">one</num> of the most mournful events in our Confederacy's mournful existence, and it had a lasting influence on the subsequent fortunes of our ill-fated cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Following so soon after the overwhelming victory of <placeName reg="Shepherd, Chattanooga, Hamilton" key="tgn,2098422">Chickamauga</placeName>, the defeat at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> was an astounding revelation of bad management <hi rend="italics">some</hi>-where, and of the rapidity with which a fine army can be demoralized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs> was won by hard fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>It was emphatically a victory for the <hi rend="italics">men</hi>. But indifferently armed and equipped, with little discipline, they turned on a pursuing army, onethird larger than their own, carried their breastworks, forced them back from their positions, and at last put them to an overwhelming rout.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>This was the work of men who had just retreated <measure n="108miles" type="distance">one hundred and eight miles</measure>. It seems strange that under such depressing circumstances they could have preserved so well their <hi rend="italics">morale</hi>, and so gallantly have done their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>But it is easily explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Every veteran soldier knows that a well-regulated retreat does not materially affect the spirits of the men. Our withdrawal from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> was such an <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It was conducted quietly and systematically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Although the rigors of military law had then little or no existence in our camp, and we, therefore, were not in a high state of discipline, yet our march was an orderly <num value="1">one</num>, and the men were cheerful and well-disposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>They had many good causes for being so. They had never known defeat, and although that absurd notion, that their foes were naturally cowards, had long been abandoned, their experience <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> on several fields had sufficed to give them just confidence in their own ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Their experience at <placeName reg="Corinth, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,7017649">Corinth, Miss.</placeName>, had amply proven to them that a retreat is not always a disaster, for had they not afterwards turned around and threatened <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/><q direct="unspecified">Who knows,</q> said they, <q direct="unspecified">but this falling back is but the presage to another advance into <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, more glorious and more permanent than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>And, again, their confidence in their leader, <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0269.0008.00034.00619" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, although not great, was still sufficient to preserve them from demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>They knew that he was a skillful officer, although not a great commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>They thought he was safe and careful, and therefore, although not likely to do great deeds, yet was, on the other hand, not likely to expose them to great disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>All this they felt towards him, although he was never personally popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>His men never forgot his harshness at the outset of his career, and all his subsequent laxity of discipline could never wipe out the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impressions of his <q direct="unspecified">tyranny.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>But their wants had in a measure been supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Their rations were sufficient, their clothing passable, they had not been through the extreme privations and destitutions which were the daily attendants of their subsequent campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>So they preserved a hopeful and buoyant disposition, and can be said to have been in as high a state of efficiency as a volunteer army could, under the circumstances, arrive at.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Under such encouraging auspices did <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00034.00620" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> fight at <placeName reg="Shepherd, Chattanooga, Hamilton" key="tgn,2098422">Chickamauga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>His whole force was about <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men; but for some reason not over <num value="55000">fifty-five thousand</num> were actually engaged.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>From the unusual combinations on our side, it looks as if our leaders intended to verify the hopes of the men, and after completely annihilating the enemy, to advance and take permanent possession of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

His forces were divided, and ours for once, equal in numbers to the foe, formed <num value="1">one</num> united and enthusiastic band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The battle, as has been said already, was fought with but a little over <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of our entire army, and <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00034.00624" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> had a force of over <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> fresh men, with which to complete the rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Why he did not do so, I have not the means of determining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>He charged <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0269.0008.00034.00625" reg="mostcommon:Polk,Leonidas,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> with negligence, and the latter was relieved temporarily of his command.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>The real cause of the blunder is open to conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>It was generally remarked at the time that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00628" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> did not seem to know how complete his victory had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The bold front which <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00629" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,H.,,:4"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> made with his single corps, had the same effect on <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00630" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> which <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00631" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,N.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>'s conduct on a similar occasion, a year after, had on himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Many officers, it was said, high in rank, were for marching into <placeName reg="Chatanooga">Chatanooga</placeName>, even after a lapse of several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The reports of the people by whose doors we passed in our advance to <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, confirmed the universal conviction of the complete demoralization of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>Yet we contented ourselves, with what we had done, and soon afterwards, from the heights of <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, in the rapidly increasing fortifications of the foe, and his daily reinforcements, beheld the <hi rend="italics">real fruits</hi> of that contest grow more and more impossible to obtain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Our sojourn on <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> was the introduction to that series of privations, which, imposed, as it seemed to us in the ranks, by the incompetency and indifference of our leaders, did more to ruin the army than almost anything else.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>During several days while he was entrenching, the enemy was summoning all his energies to strengthen his ranks, and it was not long before we heard of immense reinforcements, pouring through the mountains to the rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Their arrival swelled their numbers to over a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men, and, combined with the presence of their <num value="1">one</num> successful leader.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Our commander made but feeble attempts at entrenchment, and after his enemy had made the great accessions to his forces above referred to, <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00637" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> detached <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00638" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> and hurried it off to besiege <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Even the day before the battle, our command was withdrawn from our position on the <rs type="place">Ridge</rs> (I was then in <orgName n="command"><persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00639" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,Patrick,,,:1"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>) and we lay some time, irresolutely at the depot, waiting, as we supposed, to be sent to reinforce <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00035.00640" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Thus, by his own act, our commander seemed to make his position <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> untenable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Had it been held by sufficient numbers, <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> could never have been stormed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The real cause and manner of its capture will appear hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Our stay on <q direct="unspecified">The <rs type="place">Ridge</rs></q> was attended with a great deal of suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>It was mid-winter, and the low-grounds behind us (that fearful <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Chickamauga bottom">Chickamauga bottom</placeName></q>), over which ran our roads of supplies, were nearly all the time covered with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/><q direct="unspecified"><address><street n="Corduroy roads">Corduroy roads</street></address></q> were built for miles, yet every rain would undo all our work and make it worse than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The weather was stormy, and the camps would be flooded day and night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Winter quarters were not allowed to be built, and we therefore had no shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Starvation seemed to stare us in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>For weeks at a time, we subsisted on <num value="2">two</num> meals a day, and those <q direct="unspecified">meals</q> were a small <q direct="unspecified">pone</q> of corn-bread, and a cup of <q direct="unspecified">corn coffee.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Our duties, meantime, were increased, for our ranks had been lessened, and the enemy were becoming active and annoying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Sickness, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since our stay in and around <placeName reg="Corinth, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,7017649">Corinth (Miss.)</placeName>, broke out in our ranks, and many were swept away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>Demoralization spread fearfully among those men, who, but a few days before, had gained <num value="1">one</num> of the bloodiest victories of the war. <q direct="unspecified">Our sufferings are great,</q> said they, <q direct="unspecified">but we could bear them, if we felt there was no help for it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>It was their secret conviction that there was help, and that they were the victims of official blunders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Their disaffection was increased by the rumors of bickerings among our leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>Reports of quarrels between <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00036.00641" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> and his leading officers came down to us, and his removing from command, on the eve of the battle, <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the army, <persName n="Cheatham,,Frank,,," id="n0269.0008.00036.00642" reg="default:Cheatham,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>, looked very much like a confirmation of the reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>So, between the dissensions of the leaders and the various causes of discontent among the men, the army grew rapidly demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The withdrawal of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00036.00643" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, together with the sickness which existed, had thinned the ranks greatly, so that at the time of the battle we did not have <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men. (In many places in the line, our men were in single rank, and sprinkled <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> apart, and there were gaps where there were no men at all.) Our sufferings from hunger were such that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00036.00644" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Braxton,,,:4"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> was on the point of withdrawing (such was the general impression) when the attack of the enemy began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>It was thought, too, that it was a doubtful question: which was the most famished, the besiegers or besieged?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0269.0008.00036.00645" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> must have had very accurate accounts of our condition; for, unless he did, his movement was a very bold <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Had those <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men been able to cover all the ground, he <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> would have lost terribly, ere he had gained his point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Even as it was, it is likely that starvation alone pushed him to that venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>It was a struggle for life on both sides, with this difference: that whilst <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0269.0008.00037.00646" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was wielding <num value="4">four</num> times our force, and had an army revived in spirit and enthusiastic in its confidence in him, our little remnant, torn by dissensions, and shorn of strength, was placed in such a condition that a victory was an absurdity, and a defeat our only salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>We were expected to defend a front of <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>, exposed for the whole distance, by the nature of the country, to surprises and snares, but particularly so upon our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>That portion of our line rested on <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, but was cut off from the rest by the deep ravine which separated the mountain from the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attacked and routed, and what few men we had there nearly all killed or captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>That deep, intervening ravine was the door through which <q direct="unspecified">fighting <persName n="Hooker,,Joe,,," id="n0269.0008.00037.00647" reg="default:Hooker,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName></q> entered and gained easy access to our rear, for the simple reason that there was no <num value="1">one</num> for him to <q direct="unspecified">fight.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>That day was not <num value="1">one</num> of universal defection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Indeed it is a well known fact that we, on the extreme right, did not even know of any disaster until, after dark, the word came to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>The humiliating incidents of that rout, I shall never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>The enemy pursued us closely, and flushed with victory, grew rash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>The enemy barely made an appearance before this new position and that was all. The extreme, gingerly way in which solitary individuals, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, tip-toed towards us and at last showed themselves, was absurdly conclusive of the fact that their rashness was cured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>A moment after she struck us abreast the mizen-mast, broke it into <num value="3">three</num> pieces, crushed in the bulwarks, knocked the quarter-boat in on deck, jammed the wheel, carried away the main yard and started the beams for about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>At the same time she fired about <num value="200">two hundred</num> shots from her small arms, and <num value="2">two</num> from her great guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>She then backed off about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, and demanded our surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>I replied to the demand that I would let them know in a few moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>The reply from the <hi rend="italics">Wachsett</hi> was to surrender immediately, or they would blow us out of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>As more than half our crew were ashore, and those on board had just returned from liberty, I believed that she could run us down before we could get our guns loaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>But as I did not like to surrender the vessel without knowing what some of the other officers thought of it, I consulted <persName n="Stone,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0269.0009.00040.00666" reg="mostcommon:Stone,J.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Stone</surname></persName>, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> officer in rank; and finding that he agreed with me that we could not contend against her with any hopes of success, I informed the commander of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Wachusett">Wachusett</placeName></hi> that under the circumstances I would surrender the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>In equipping the armies <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sent into the field the supply of these accessories was amazingly scant; and these deficiencies were felt more keenly, perhaps than the more important want of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>We had arms, such as they were, for over <num value="100000">1000,00</num> men; but we had no accoutrements nor equipments; and these had to be extemporized <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> in a great measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>In time, knapsacks were little thought of by the troops and we at last contented ourselves with supplying haversacks, which the women (Heaven reward their labors) could make, and for which we could get cotton cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>But cartridge boxes we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have: and as leather was also needed for artillery harness and for cavalry saddles, we had to divide the stock of leather the country could produce, among these much needed articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>But soldier's shoes were even more needed than some of these; so that as all could not be fully provided, a scale of preference was established.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>To economize leather, the cartridge boxes and waist-belts were made of prepared cotton cloth, stitched in <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> thicknesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>Bridle-reins were also so made, and even cartridge-boxes covered with it, except the flap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>Considerable bodies of troops not attached to that army have either dispersed or marched toward their homes, accompanied by many of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>That officer thinks it wholly impossible <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> for him to make any head against the overwhelming forces of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>Our ports are closed and the sources of foreign supply lost to us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>I do not think it would be possible to assemble, equip and maintain an army of <num value="30000">30,000</num> men at any point east of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>The contest, if continued after this paper is rejected, will be likely to lose entirely the dignity of regular warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>Many of the <name>States</name> will make such terms as they may; in others, separate and ineffective hostilities may be prosecuted, while war, wherever waged, will probably degenerate into that irregular and secondary stage out of which greater evils will flow to the <rs>South</rs> than to the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>For these, and for other reasons which need not now be stated, I think we can no longer contend with a reasonable hope of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>In the popular imagination he figures as the mighty conqueror, whose campaign in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and the <name>Carolinas</name> virtually ended the war between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>In point of fact it was nothing of the kind, but was, in a military point of view, a very commonplace affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>To hover by turns around his front, his flanks and his rear; to pounce upon his foraging parties, who were burning and harrying; to dash between his marching columns and cut off marauders; to save the lives and property, as far as practicable, of women and children; such were the chief occupations of our General during this campaign, and with indefatigable energy did he attend to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>The service was full of personal adventure and excitement for his followers; there were frequent little brushes with raiding parties, and now and then a lively time in eluding larger bodies, and this would be enlivened by almost hourly chases of <q direct="unspecified">bummers,</q> whose pockets were seldom found unsupplied with stolen jewelry and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> baptismal cups, and the recapturing of farm animals laden with household spoils.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>I then observed that such of the men as I could make out in the darkness were close to their horses, and that the animals were saddled and bitted, ready to be mounted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>I soon discovered the explanation of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/></p> 
<p>As point was given to this sudden information by the mute but eloquent muzzles of cocked revolvers covering them, the picket quietly accepted the situation without making themselves disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>They were then marched forward until the advance-guard of our division was met, when they were duly turned over as prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Of course these fellows were entirely unaware that they had been <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> captured by a mere handful of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>A few dismounted men were sent forward singly to secrete themselves along the roadside near the entrance of the <rs>Federal</rs> camp, to be ready to noiselessly take chage of any <num value="1">one</num> from there who might intend visiting their picket that night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>The consequence of all this was that we were to make a call next morning, as soon as there was light enough, upon <persName n="Kilpatrick,General,,,," id="n0269.0036.00126.01353" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>, dispensing with the formality of personal introductions, not even sending in our cards before our <q direct="unspecified">surprise party</q> should be with him to an early breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>This, it was hoped, would induce him, <q direct="unspecified">on hospitable thoughts intent,</q> to give up his camp and as many of his men as he could spare to his enterprising guests; in short, his entire corps was to be wiped out before assistance could reach him from the infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>The night passed wearily enough as we sat huddled together in the mud among our sleepy horses, but at length the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faint light preceding the dawn was visible; then the command moved silently out of the wood and formed noiselessly on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>The rain had by this time ceased, but the atmosphere was so obscured by mist that <num value="1">one</num> could hardly realize the night was ended, and found the range of vision very limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>After some minutes a portion of the division, which was to lead in the attack, moved down the road on a slow walk in the direction of the <rs>Federal</rs> camp, and halted just outside of it. Here a few words were addressed to the men by the <rs>General</rs> in his quiet, clear, incisive voice, he looking, every inch of him, the beau ideal of a cavalier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>Then he galloped to the head of the column and his order&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Follow me, men. Charge!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>rang out for friend and foe to hear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>In a moment the cavalrymen were dashing with a magnificent Confederate yell through <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00126.01354" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>All there were buried in the profound slumber of supposed security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>The sleepy camp <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> guards and a few cooks busied about camp-fires attempted no resistance, and the troopers, thus rudely awakened, rubbed their eyes and peered out from under their canvas flies in droll bewilderment at the row. It was very good fun at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but the unwieldy number of prisoners was awkward; we could not <q direct="unspecified">surround</q> them, as the <name>Irishman</name> said he did his dozen or more captives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>Presently they began to rally in knots, and then the hand &mdash; to hand skirmishing became pretty brisk, as compliments were being exchanged at close quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>It was especially lively near a little house which loomed up through the mist and around which were tied many horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of these barebacked animals jumped a brawny Federal, and with his revolver did as gallant fighting as <num value="1">one</num> could wish to see.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>At length he fell under his horse's feet, having died pluckily, as a true soldier should, to save his chief; for that black horse he rode was <persName n="Killpatrick,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00127.01355" reg="mostcommon:Killpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Killpatrick</surname></persName>'s own, and within the little house were his headquarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>Just then there bolted from the door a sorry-looking figure in his shirt and drawers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>The fugitive made no fight, but cutting loose and springing astride a horse <q direct="unspecified">tarried not on the order of his going,</q> but sped for safety through the fog and powder-smoke as fast as a militiaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>No <num value="1">one</num> stopped him, thinking it not worth while in presence of such abundance of better-seeming game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> man recognized in the humble runaway the quondam bumptious <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> and future politician, and he gave chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>His pistol being empty he meant to ride him down, and would have done so, but unhappily his horse fell on the wet, slippery ground, and he had the mortification of seeing <persName n="Kilpatrick,General,,,," id="n0269.0036.00127.01356" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> disappear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>A striking contrast to him was <hi rend="italics">our</hi> General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>Showing no weapon, but carrying a little riding-whip, with which he pointed here and there, directing the operations, he seemed the brain of the physical mass around him. It required no great stretch of imagination to fancy him the leader of a mighty orchestra, and his men the music makers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>It used to be said his skin glanced bullets, and that it required a <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounder to carry away that <num value="1">one</num> leg in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 18" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and I often thought there must be something in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/><q direct="unspecified">Tell him to flank them back,</q> was the <rs>General</rs>'s laconic reply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>And now in wild alarm there emerged from the house, whose <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> weather-boards were fast being perforated by chance bullets, a strange apparition, <num value="1">one</num> quite out of place in such wild scenes&mdash;a forlorn, forsaken damsel&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> who was <q direct="unspecified">neither maid, wife, nor widow,</q> and who was <q direct="unspecified">attached</q> to headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>She looked for a moment disconsolately at her carriage, which was close at hand, as if with the vague idea in her dazed head that it was high time for her to be leaving, and then stood still in mute despair as it broke upon her that it could not move without horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Seeing that she was in imminent danger from stray shots that were flying about, a cavalryman dismounted and conducted the poor thing, in all courtesy, to a drainage-ditch, within which she crouched in safety, as if it had been a rifle-pit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>It was noticed, however, that, in spite of the risk thus incurred, she persisted in lifting her head from time to time and peered above the ditch to see what was going on, thus showing, as some <num value="1">one</num> said, that female curiosity is stronger even than love of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>The remainder of our division had come on to support the attacking detachment, and as they entered the camp a very sad and touching incident occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Some prisoners (they were chiefly worn-out stragglers from the infantry), whom <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00128.01357" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> had with him, recognizing the splendid ring of the <rs>Confederate</rs> battle cry, burst from their guard, and frantic with joy, rushed forth to meet their deliverers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/><num value="1">One</num> poor fellow, the foremost of them all, ragged, half-starved, and lately wretched but now nearly crazed with delight, attempted to embrace a horse's neck, but mistaken in the obscurity for an assailant, met his death at the rider's hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>Perceiving too late his error, the slayer sprang to the ground and bent remorsefully over the corpse, only to recognize in the ghastly features of the dead a near neighbor and life-long friend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>There was another occurrence which had a ludicrous, as well as tragic side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>A driver of a headquarter wagon was snoozing so soundly under the white topped cover, curled up snugly in the nice, warm straw within, that he did not awake until some little time after we had been in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>He must have been very much fatigued, from doing nothing, or perhaps had taken an over-heavy night-cap to guard against the dampness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>At length, becoming aroused by all the din around him, he pushed aside the curtains and looked sleepily out, blear-eyed and frowsy from his morning nap, at a loss to make out the meaning of such a hurly-burly, and with no idea of hurting any <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>Unluckily for him, his harmless intentions were not understood until too late, as there was no time then for long-winded inquiries and <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/><num value="1">One</num> of our men happened to be riding by so near that the fellow almost touched him with his sleepy head as he popped it out between the curtains, and, startled by it into instinctive selfdefence, promptly put an end to him, so that the poor wretch never got really well awake at all. It was much to be regretted, but the moral is, it is a bad thing to sleep too late in the mornings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>It was not long before the entire camp was in our possession, those who had not fled to the cover of the infantry or sought refuge in a swamp hard by having been slain or captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>The herd and its official leader had been from the outset completely demoralized, and the heroism of individuals could not redeem the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>It only remained to hold what had been gained, but that was the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>If it had not been for overwhelming masses of infantry near at hand <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00129.01358" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, as an organized body, would have never again existed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>Most of our men were dismounted and thrown forward as infantry to hold the ground until the captured horses, artillery and wagons could be removed or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>The programme had been for a portion of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00129.01359" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,Joseph,,,:3"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> to attack the camp on our right as soon as the firing indicated to them that the ball was opened, but owing to the swampy nature of the ground after the rain, and other reasons not necessary to mention, they unfortunately did not come up in time to answer the purpose intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>At length portions of the scattered Federal cavalry began to take heart and rally under the wing of their infantry, and it became necessary for our command to withdraw before the pressure of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>We carried away many <measure n="100" type="prisoners">hundred prisoners</measure> (nearly as many as the entire attacking force), and numbers of horses, among them <num value="3">three</num> of <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00129.01360" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s private mounts, the gallant black already alluded to, a piebald, and a bay. When we had retired it was practicable for that General to return to his headquarters, which he had left in the rather abrupt manner that I have attempted to describe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Thus terminated an affair which, as far as I know, has not been recorded, or even dignified by a name; yet it was not without brilliancy in conception and romantic dash in execution, and its results failed of being decisive simply from the vast disproportion of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>If it had occurred in the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi> American war for independence its achievements would have been chronicled with flourishes of the historic pen, and it might have supplied a theme for many a fervid centennial speaker.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Some weeks afterwards, when <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00129.01361" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:23"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had been disbanded, <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> I passed over the ground of this fight, as I was making my way southward by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>I reached the house which had been <placeName><persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n0269.0036.00130.01362" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:2"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName> at a late hour, and a more dismal, unearthly scene than I beheld it would be difficult to imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>The dwelling was entirely deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>Perhaps its owner, driven forth from her home with her little ones to make room for the <name>Woman</name> of the <name>Ditch</name>, had perished from hunger and exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>At all events it was unoccupied by any living thing; the windows were without sashes, the front door broken from its hinges, and all fences and out-buildings had disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>Near the dilapidated piazza, to the railing of which several horses had been tied on the morning when the corps was stampeded, were some carcasses, and at a few paces distant, where many horses had been fastened to a fence, there were numerous skeletons of the poor brutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>From these the hides had been stripped and the bones picked bare, doubtless by vagrant curs and predatory vermin from the neighboring swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>The human remains had been interred, but rain and wind, assisted probably by animals, had in many instances partially removed from them the earth, so that the fleshless faces peered up at <num value="1">one</num>, and bony hands stretched forth as if to beckon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>The effect was heightened by the faint moonlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>It was an uncanny place, and the least superstitious would have been likely to have experienced some strange feelings there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>The skeleton hands seemed then, as I said, to beckon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Since that time I have thought they intended a different meaning; that they sought to implore the living not to forget the dead, but to keep alive forever the glory of each hero who bit the dust, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/></p> 
<p>I should not write you to call attention to the fact that the statement referred to contains more which is the result of a pure effort of the imagination than of the truth, if I did not credit your society with a sincere desire to publish facts, and not fiction, in making up the history of the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>That there was a large Federal force within sight is true; but with the exception of <num value="3">three</num> gun-boats, the entire force would have proved quite as effective if it had remained at New Orleans, simply from the fact that it was impracticable to land the army, and the naval vessels drew so much water that with the exception of the gun-boats referred to it could not approach nearer than <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> to <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0269.0037.00131.01367" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:12"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified"><num value="40">forty</num> bravest men,</q> who were as safe from harm in the earth-work as they would have been a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>The balance of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces, owing to the heavy draft of the vessels, could not get within less than <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> of the fort; the nearest point at which any other vessel, than those named, succeeded in getting during the entire engagement was the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi-river</placeName> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Laurel Hill,</rs> which drew <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> of water, and the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Thomas,,R.,W.,," id="n0269.0037.00132.01368" reg="default:Thomas,R.,W.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>,</q> another <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi-river</placeName> steamer, drawing a little more water.

<p>The inquiry may naturally arise how this small number of men could take charge of so large a body of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>This required that to their valor they should add strategem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>A few men were placed on the parapet as sentinels, the rest were marched out as a <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> guard to receive the prisoners and their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>Thus was concealed the fact that the fort was empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/><hi rend="italics">My Dear Father</hi>, &mdash;Since my last to mother much of interest has transpired, and all before my eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>I have seen a desperate battle fought, preceded, as it was, by <num value="1">one</num> of the most furious bombardments of the war. About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <num value="5">five</num> <term type="ship">monitors</term>, the <rs type="ship">Ironsides</rs>, and <num value="5">five</num> gunboats moved up in front of <persName n="Wagner,,,,," id="n0269.0038.00137.01441" reg="mostcommon:Wagner,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Wagner</surname></persName> and immediately opened a most terrific shelling, and they had not fired long before the enemy's batteries (<num value="2">two</num> in number) joined in, and all together poured forth their missiles of death for <num value="10">ten</num> long hours on our little fort, containing only <num value="1">one</num> gun with which we were able to reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>The rest of the guns in the fort are of light calibre and useful only against an assaulting party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Our men took refuge in their bomb-proofs, and, having sustained only a few casualties, <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> quietly awaited the time when they would be afforded an opportunity for taking revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>That time came much sooner than they anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>About dusk the dark and dense columns were seen moving slowly down the beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>When they had reached the commencement of the open plain in front of and entirely commanded by the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">first brigade</orgName>, under <persName n="Strong,General,,,," id="n0269.0038.00138.01442" reg="mostcommon:Strong,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Strong</surname></persName>, being formed in <num value="2">two</num> columns, made a dashing charge for our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>They reached the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, but were repulsed and driven back in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Immediately the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">second brigade</orgName>, under <persName n="Putnam,Colonel,,,," id="n0269.0038.00138.01443" reg="nearbymention:Putnam,G.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Putnam</surname></persName>, moved to the assault, and reached and took possession of the main portion of our works, but the ditch in front, filled with dead and dying, and the scattered dead and wounded across the whole plain, told how dearly they had paid for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>The enemy kept possession of the portion they had taken for <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of an hour, were there in force even after all the rest of their comrades had retreated, and but for a gallant charge of a handful of men from the <orgName n="Charleston Battalion" type="battalion">Charleston Battalion</orgName>, led by <persName n="Taliaferro,General,,,," id="n0269.0038.00138.01444" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,A.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName> in person, they would well nigh have taken our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Our little band charged them at the point of the bayonet, and either killed, wounded, or took possession of the whole party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>If the enemy had been supported, I believe the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> would have fallen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>Thus ended <num value="1">one</num> of the most desperate little battles of this war. It was really fought by about <num value="500">500</num> of our men against <num value="12">twelve</num> regiments of the enemy, numbering about <num value="8">8</num>, <num value="000">000</num> in all, in <num value="2">two</num> brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>I visited the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> yesterday, and went all over the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>The dead and wounded were piled up in a ditch together, sometimes <num value="50">fifty</num> in a heap, and they were strewn all over the plain for a distance of <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>They had <num value="2">two</num> negro regiments, and they were slaughtered in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/><num value="1">One</num> pile of negroes numbered <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>Numbers of both whites and blacks were killed on top our breastworks, as well as inside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>The negroes fought gallantly, and were headed by as brave a Colonel as ever lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>He mounted the breastworks, waving his sword, and at the head of his regiment, and he and a negro orderly sergeant fell dead over the inner crest of the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>The negroes were as fine looking set as I ever saw&mdash;large, strong, muscular fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>They were splendidly uniformed; but they do not know what they are fighting for. They say they were forced into it. I learned from prisoners that they are held in contempt by the white soldiers, and not only so, but that the white officers who command them are despised also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>They are made to do all the drudgery of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/><pb id="p.139" n="139"/></p> 
<p>The enemy's loss was, according to the best estimates, <measure n="600" type="killed">600 killed</measure> and about the same number wounded and prisoners together, while our loss, all told, was not more than <num value="150">150</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> of the negro regiments has been recognized as a very wealthy gentleman from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>The enemy sent a flag of truce over yesterday morning, asking to be allowed to bury their dead, but <persName n="Hagood,General,,,," id="n0269.0038.00139.01445" reg="mostcommon:Hagood,Johnson,,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName>, who has relieved <persName n="Taliaferro,General,,,," id="n0269.0038.00139.01446" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,A.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName> for the present, replied that <hi rend="italics">we</hi> would attend to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>There was a kind of mutual agreement, however, that all operations should be suspended for the day, and while I was on the field about <num value="50">fifty</num> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> came over, and were circulating freely among our working parties, cracking jokes and <q direct="unspecified">cutting</q> at each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>I did not speak to them myself, but in company with a Lieutenant from the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, went up nearly to the enemy's rifle pits, and was in about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>I went up to try to see the strength of their stockade work, and depth of the ditch in front of us, together with the number of guns, &amp;c., in their batteries, but was unable to make any discoveries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>During the fight we assisted with such a fire as old <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> was able to give, and all the time during the day while the enemy were firing so furiously on the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, we kept up a slow fire at their batteries, and now and then gave their monitors a turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>We were at the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> from <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> Saturday till <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, without scarcely leaving it. <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Wagner</placeName> is uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>All it needs is heavier guns to keep off the fleet, and our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> won't send these to them, for fear of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>'s being taken and the guns being lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>If they be <hi rend="italics">not</hi> sent I believe the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> will fall, for it is now almost encircled with gunboats and batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>The garrison holds out bravely, and if assisted, as it deserves to be, <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Wagner</placeName> cannot be taken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>It is now <time value="3pm">3 O'clock P. M.</time> The bombardment was recommenced to-day, and still continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>The enemy's batteries have just opened on <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>This morning the enemy opened on the <rs>Fort</rs> with a <num value="200">200</num>-pound <name type="weapon">Parrott gun</name> and shelled us rapidly for about <num value="1">one</num> hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> with, we all admit, the greatest accuracy, and also with considerable damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>A steamer at the wharf was almost torn to pieces by a single shot, which, entering at the bow, raked her fore and aft, penetrating the boiler and bursting the machinery into fragments, besides scalding several negroes severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>Another unlucky (or lucky, as you may be pleased to call it) shot, found its way to our <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> bake-house and tore up the bake-oven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>Several others played the wild in the company quarters, but fortunately nobody has been hurt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>I went over to <orgName n="Battery Wagner" type="battery">Battery Wagner</orgName> yesterday evening, on duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>The enemy have extended their approaches to within <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>Night before last, however, we used grape and canister on their most advanced work and drove them off, but I understand they worked considerably last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>They have now reached the extreme end of the sand hills, and the remaining portion of ground over which or through which they have to advance is a low, open, level plain, very much exposed to flank fire, and it will be many times more difficult for them to advance farther now than it has been for them to reach the position they already occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>Our men on the <rs type="place">Island</rs> are in fine spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>They have learned to perfection that lovely art, familiarly known to all those who have had occasion to appreciate it, as the <q direct="unspecified">art of dodging.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>The artillery remain in the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>; the infantry support grabble holes in the sand hills this side, and then they sit all day long watching that hateful puff of smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>When they see it, like prairie dogs, they pop down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>When all is over, the hills are alive again, and the glorious Confederates who but just now mingled with pleasure with <q direct="unspecified">fiddlers</q> and <q direct="unspecified">sand crabs,</q> now rise up to the dignity of their species and can be seen brushing their clothing and shaking sand out of their locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>At the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> the men are in high spirits, always cracking jokes and laughing while the shelling is going on. They have watched the enemy's batteries so much until they know each gun and have a name for each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>They have the utmost contempt for a Whitworth or <persName n="Parrott,,,,," id="n0269.0041.00161.01989" reg="mostcommon:Parrott,nomatch:0"><surname>Parrott</surname></persName> shot, and pay no regard to them whatever; but I can tell you when they hear the words, <q direct="unspecified">Look out, mortar!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>you can see a long train of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Colonel">Colonels</rs>, <rs type="role2">Majors</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Captain">Captains</rs>, <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs>, <rs type="role" n="Private">privates</rs>, quartermasters, commissary and ordnance officers all walking as if they would like to go faster, into the bomb-proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>The enemy have some little mortars that shoot shrapnel shells, and with these they do a good deal of damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>The sharpshooters on both sides keep up a constant duel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>Whenever a man shows his head over the parapet at the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, he is sure to get a shot at him. And they are constantly practicing all kinds of tricks, such as holding up their hats on sticks to be shot at, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>Evidently the object of the enemy is now to endeavor to take <persName n="Wagner,,,,," id="n0269.0041.00161.01990" reg="mostcommon:Wagner,Tom,,,:1"><surname>Wagner</surname></persName> by gradual approaches, and ours seems to be to dispute every inch of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>The enemy are far ahead of us in skill and energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/><pb id="p.162" n="162"/> In an open field fight I believe we can whip them with any sort of showing, but when you come to regular operations requiring engineering skill, we can't compare with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>But the want of energy in this department, on our side, has surely been unpardonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>But I have already said too much on this subject, and I forbear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>I have always thought that it was no part of private citizens, much less of officers, to keep constantly abusing our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> because they happen to be unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>It is easy to say how a thing should have been done after <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> ways has failed, and it too often happens that we are unacquainted with the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>The truth is, we are too much influenced in our opinions by disappointed hopes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>I have no fears for <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>Nothing that I have seen induces me to entertain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>I cannot express to you the pride I feel in and the love I entertain for the old city, the glorious mother of freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>The work is going on in the fort very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>All the casemates of the <num value="2">two</num> sides facing the <rs type="place">Island</rs> are filled up with cotton bales and sand, and the engineer is now engaged in building traverses on the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> and putting up sand-bags on the outside of the gorge, or the side of the fort through which the old Sally-Port came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The base of the sand-bags, extending out from the wall, will be <measure n="24feet" type="distance">twenty-four feet</measure>, out to the edge of the wharf, and they can be built up entirely to the top of the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>All the important guns have been moved out of the fort, and their places filled with dummies, or sham-guns, of the <rs>Brooke</rs>'s pattern.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>It is now <time value="9pm">9 o'clock P. M.</time> I was unable to finish my letter this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>The enemy opened on us again about <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> this evening with the same <num value="200">200</num>-pound <persName n="Parrott,,,,," id="n0269.0041.00162.01992" reg="mostcommon:Parrott,nomatch:0"><surname>Parrott</surname></persName>, at a distance of <num value="3">three</num> and a-half miles, and I venture to say the world never witnessed better shooting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>It is a rare thing they miss the <rs>Fort</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>We have not replied to-day, owing to the <rs>Brooke</rs> gun being slightly out of order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>To-morrow we will feel them a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>The casualties today were <num value="3">three</num> men wounded, <num value="2">two</num> severely, and young <persName n="Rice,,,,," id="n0269.0041.00162.01993" reg="mostcommon:Rice,R.,S.,,:1"><surname>Rice</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">signal corps</orgName>, who was in college with me, was knocked down by a brick-bat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>Our arrival at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was hailed with delight by all the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>The officers came on board to see the marks of the struggle, whilst squads of eager privates collected on the bank to get a near view of the wonderful craft which had just stood so much hammering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>This attracted a daring band of sharpshooters to the other bank, and we were forced to open with our heavy guns to disperse them, which was easily accomplished by half a dozen discharges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>The enemy below showed decided signs of demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>A mortar-boat which had been allowed to get aground was hastily set on fire and blown up. A sea-going vessel (commanded by <persName n="Craven,,,,," id="n0269.0042.00163.01996" reg="mostcommon:Craven,nomatch:0"><surname>Craven</surname></persName>), left to guard the transports, sprung her broadside athwart the stream to be ready for an attack.

If we had had a smoke-stack, and proper boiler fronts, and good engines, and a new crew, and many other things, how we would have made a smash of those fellows!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>But as our smoke-stack was so riddled, the draft was destroyed, and as our engines were troublesome, faulty affairs, and our crew were nearly all killed, wounded, or used up, we had to bide where we were, and see this chance slip away from us. Read cast many longing glances down the river, and I think would have been perfectly willing to undertake the task, broken down as we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>But there is a limit to human endurance; we could do no more, and we rested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>The medicines of the ship were dashed into the engine-room, and the <hi rend="italics">debris</hi> from the bulkheads and splinters from the side enveloped the machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>Frigates, gunboats, iron-plated boats, wooden rams and iron-cased rams were anchored along the banks for a mile and a-half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>And slowly steaming along the hollow of the bend in the river, just above us, was a long, low, dull, red, floating object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>She showed neither flag, [mistake], nor sign of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>A couple of gunboats were anchored ahead of us, but being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the large ships, we all supposed we would be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>Her course also seemed to indicate it. <num value="2">Two</num> (<num value="1">one</num>) of our gunboats now fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>The <rs>Arkansas</rs> answered, taking off <num value="1">one</num> man's head and wounding <num value="3">three</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>I saw her pass the gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>I looked for some vessel moving to attack her. Not <num value="1">one</num> stirred; only <num value="1">one</num> man had steam up on his vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>We believe he could have sunk her, (bosh!) yet he did not move a finger, because he <q direct="unspecified">didn't receive orders.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>Slowly, steadily, gallantly, the <name n="Confederate States">Rebel</name> ram kept on her way, as though she belonged to us and was quietly choosing an anchorage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>She was now approaching us, and, as all the rest of the crew had been at their quarters some time, I was obliged to go to mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>I sat down and <q direct="unspecified">coolly</q> awaited the blow I knew must sink us. In a few minutes our guns were fired in quick succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>I waited, but no crash followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>I went on deck and saw the ram slowly floating below uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>Our solid wrought iron shot had been shattered to pieces against her sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>Let us now proceed with our narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>We were dealing with a bold and confident enemy, determined to take some desperate chances to compass our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>As the reader already knows our crew was fearfully used up on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>Many of the younger officers had also succumbed; those of us who were left were used up also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>We slept below, with our clothes on, in an atmosphere so heated by the steam of the engines as to keep <num value="1">one</num> in a constant perspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>No more men were to be had. It was disheartening enough to see a ship which but a week <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> before was the pride of the country now almost deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, a week after our arrival, we were awakened early in the morning by the drum calling us to quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>Great commotion was observed in the fleet above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>Everything seemed under-way again, and it was evident that we were soon to have another brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>On our decks were not men enough to man <num value="2">two</num> guns, and not firemen enough to keep steam up if we were forced into the stream!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>Rather a doleful outlook!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>We were moored to the bank, head up the river, as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>The fires under the boilers were hastened, and every possible preparation made for resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>In a few minutes we observed the <term type="ship">iron-clad steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Essex</rs> (<q direct="unspecified">Dirty Bill <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0269.0042.00168.02016" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Fitz,John,,:5"><surname>Porter</surname></persName></q> commanding) steaming around the point and steering for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>I followed, hitting her fair, but still she persevered in sullen silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>Her plan was to run into and shove us aground, when her consort, the <rs n="Queen of the West" type="ship">Queen of the West</rs>, was to follow and but a hole in us; and thus the dreaded ram was to be made way with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>On she came like a mad bull, nothing daunted or overawed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>As soon as <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0269.0042.00168.02018" reg="nearbymention:Brown,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> got a fair view of her, followed at a distance by the <rs>Queen</rs>, he divined her intent, and seeing that she was as square across the bow as a flatboat or scow, and we were as sharp as a wedge, he determined at once to foil her tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>Slacking off the hawser which held our head to the bank, he went ahead on the starboard screw, and thus our sharp prow was turned directly for her to hit against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>This disconcerted the enemy and destroyed his plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>A collision would surely cut him down and leave us uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>All this time we had not been idle spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>The <num value="2">two</num> Columbiads had been ringing on his front and piercing him every shot; to which he did not reply until he found that the shoving game was out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>Then, and when not more than <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards distant</measure>, he triced up his <num value="3">three</num> bow port-shutters and poured out his fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>A <measure n="9inch" type="distance">nine-inch</measure> shot struck our armor a few inches forward of the unlucky forward port, and crawling along the side entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/><num value="7">Seven</num> men were killed outright and <measure n="6" type="wounded">six wounded</measure>. Splinters flew in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>In an instant the enemy was alongside, and his momentum was so great that he ran aground a short distance astern of us. As he passed we poured out our port broadside, and as soon as the stern rifles could be cleared of the splinters and broken stanchions and woodwork, which had been driven the whole length of the gunbox, we went ahead on our port screw and turned our stern guns on him, and every man&mdash;we had but <num value="17">seventeen</num> left&mdash;and officer went to <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>As he passed he did not fire, nor did he whilst we were riddling him close aboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>His only effort was to get away from us. He backed hard on his engines and finally got off; but getting a shot in his machinery just as he got afloat, he was compelled to float down stream and join the lower fleet, which he accomplished without damage from the batteries on the hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>He fired only the <num value="3">three</num> shots mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>But <hi rend="italics">our</hi> troubles were not over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>The roads were in wretched condition in consequence of the inclemency of the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>The heavy rains rendered the streams almost impassible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/>Short rations, provender and clothing added much to the suffering of both man and beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>The pelting of the rain, sleet and snow upon the backs of half naked, half starved men as they marched day and night before a relentless foe is only a part of the true story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>Many mules were taken from the ordnance wagons to be used in the pontoon train.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>The battalion marched to <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName> the night of the <dateStruct value="1864-12-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> and on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, reached <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>, where the battalion encamped for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>The next day, the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct>, the retreat was resumed, marching all day and the greater part of the night through rain and snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>To bring about this desirable state of things, the <rs>Southern States</rs> were divided into several military districts, over each of which an officer was appointed, with all the powers of a Persian Satrap, excepting that he could not take away the life of a citizen, except by due form of law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>This is our last chapter, and most painful and difficult is it to write; for we have no longer to tell of gallant deeds and great achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>Our task now is simply to relate the last adventures of the great ship, to tell how her engines broke down, and it became an act of duty to apply the torch to her. We will write her <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> obituary and be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>Shortly after the events related in the last chapter the enemy embarked his troops on board transports and gave up the bombardment of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> for <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>He had never attempted a siege, inasmuch as his force of infantry was inferior to ours, and he did not occupy the same side of the river as that on which <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> stands, but merely under cover and by virtue of his superior naval force, was able to occupy a position near <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, from which he could throw shells into the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>The same thing occurred at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> and several other places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>And I think that it would be no difficult matter to show that the navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had more to do with destroying the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> than the army&mdash;or rather that the operations of the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName> could have been easily checked, and it overwhelmed and beaten back across the border, and kept there, but for the powerful cooperation of the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>Therefore the great error in policy of those who guided the destinies of the <rs>South</rs> was in not putting afloat at an early day a navy superior to that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>There are those, probably, who being but slightly acquainted with such matters, will urge that it was an impossibility so to do. They are greatly in error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>I hazard little when I say that if the great <rs>Mississippi</rs> had been completed at New Orleans a month before she was burned, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would now be <num value="1">one</num> of the nations of the earth, instead of conquered provinces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>Shortly after the enemy left the shore opposite <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> an expedition was planned against <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName>, <persName n="Breckinridge,General,John,C.,," id="n0269.0050.00206.02375" reg="default:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>After the army had arrived at <placeName reg="Tangipahoa, Tangipahoa, Louisiana" key="tgn,2044125">Tangipahoa</placeName> it was determined to ask for the assistance of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>Application was made by <persName n="Dorn,General,,,,Van" id="n0269.0050.00206.02378" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Dorn</surname></persName> to <persName n="Lynch,Commodore,,,," id="n0269.0050.00206.02379" reg="mostcommon:Lynch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Lynch</surname></persName>, who gave the order to proceed down the river as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>The vessel was hurriedly coaled and provisioned, and men and officers hastened to join her. <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0269.0050.00206.02380" reg="nearbymention:Brown,Isaac,Newton,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> left his bed to regain his ship, but arrived too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>He subsequently followed down by rail and assumed command of the crew shortly after the destruction of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>The reader must not construe any remark here to reflect on <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00206.02381" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>Such is not my intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>He was a conscientious, <name>Christian</name> gentleman, a zealous and efficient officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>In the performance of his duty he was thorough, consistent and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>His courage was of the truest and highest type; in the face of the enemy he knew nothing but his duty, and always did it. Under this officer we left <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> <num value="30">thirty</num> <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> hours before <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0269.0050.00207.02382" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> had arranged to make his attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>The short time allowed to arrive at the rendezvous made it imperative that the vessel should be driven up to her best speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>This resulted in the frequent disarrangements of the machinery and consequent stoppages to key up and make repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>Every delay required more speed thereafter in order to meet our appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>Another matter operated against us. We had been compelled to leave behind, in the hospital, our chief engineer, George W. City, who was worn out and broken down by excessive watching and anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>His care and nursing had kept the machinery in order up to the time of leaving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>We soon began to feel his loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>The engineer in charge, a volunteer from the army, had recently joined us, and though a young man<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/> 
<p>I have forgotten his name.</p></note> of pluck and gallantry, and possessed of great will and determination to make the engines work, yet he was unequal to the task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>He had never had anything to do with a screw vessel or short-stroke engines, and, being zealous for the good repute of his department, drove the machinery beyond its powers of endurance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>The reader may wonder why the machinery of a vessel of so much importance should have been entrusted to a strange and inexperienced person, and ask for an explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>Were there not other engineers than <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> City in the navy, and, if so, where were they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>There were dozens of engineers of long experience and high standing at that time in the navy, most of whom were idle at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and other stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>At or near the mouth of <placeName reg="Natchitoches, Natchitoches, Louisiana" key="tgn,7014191">Red river</placeName>, the engines had grown so contrary and required to be hammered so much that <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00207.02383" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> deemed it his duty to call a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> to determine whether it was proper to proceed or return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>The engineer was summoned and gave it as his opinion that the machinery would hold out, and upon that statement we determined to go ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>A few miles below <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> he demanded a stoppage to key up and make all things secure before going into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>We landed at the right bank of the river, and I was dispatched with <persName n="Bacot,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00207.02384" reg="nearbymention:Bacot,Richard,H.,,"><surname>Bacot</surname></persName> to a house near by to get information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>After a deal of trouble we gained admittance and learned that the naval force of the enemy at <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName> consisted of our particular enemy, the <rs>Essex</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> small sea-going wooden gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>This was very satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>We learned, also, that <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00207.02385" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> was to attack at daylight; that his movements had been known for several days <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> on that side of the river; yet it will be borne in mind that this important secret could not be entrusted to high officers of the navy until a few hours before they were to co-operate in the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>At daylight we heard our gallant troops commence the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>The long rattle of the volleys of musketry, mixed with the deep notes of artillery, informed us that we were behind, and soon came the unmistakable boom of heavy navy guns, which plainly told us that we were wanted&mdash;that our iron sides should be receiving those missiles which were now mowing down our ranks of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>In feverish haste our lines were cast off and hauled aboard, and once more the good ship was driving towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>Like a war-horse she seemed to scent the battle from afar, and in point of speed outdid anything we had ever before witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>There was a fatal error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>Had she been nursed then by our young and over-zealous engineer she would have again made her mark in the day's fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>We were in sight of <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>The battle had ceased; our troops had driven the enemy to the edge of the water, captured his camps and his positions, and had in turn retired before the heavy broadsides of the <rs>Essex</rs>, which lay moored abreast of the arsenal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>Our officers and crew went to quarters in high spirits, for once there was a chance to make the army and country appreciate us. <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName> is situated on a <q direct="unspecified">reach</q> or long, straight stretch of river, which extends <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> above the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>We were nearly to the turn and about to enter the <q direct="unspecified">reach;</q> the crew had been mustered at quarters, divisions reported, and all the minute preparations made for battle which have before been detailed, when <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00208.02386" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> came on deck with <persName n="Brady,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00208.02387" reg="nearbymention:Brady,James,,,"><surname>Brady</surname></persName>, the pilot, to take a final look and determine upon what plan to adopt in his attack on the <rs>Essex</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>It was my watch and we <num value="3">three</num> stood together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/><persName n="Brady,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00208.02388" reg="nearbymention:Brady,James,,,"><surname>Brady</surname></persName> proposed that we ram the <rs>Essex</rs> and sink her where she lay, then back out and put ourselves below the transports and wooden gunboats as soon as possible to cut off their retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/><persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00208.02389" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> assented to the proposal and had just remarked that we had better go to our stations, for we were in a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the turn, when the starboard engine stopped suddenly, and, before the man at the wheel could meet her with the helm, the ship ran hard and fast aground, jamming herself on to some old cypress stumps that were submerged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>We were in full view from the position <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0269.0050.00208.02390" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> had taken up to await our attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>All day long he remained in line of battle prepared to move forward again, but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>On investigation it was found <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> that the engine was so badly out of order that several hours must be consumed before we could again expect to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>There lay the enemy in plain view, and we as helpless as a shear-hulk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>Hundreds of people had assembled to witness the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>In fact, many ladies in carriages had come to see our triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>They waved us on with smiles and prayers, but we couldn't go. But <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00209.02391" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> was not the man to give up. A quantity of <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, which had been laid on deck loose, was thrown overboard, and in a few hours we were afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>The engineers had pulled the engine to pieces and with files and chisels were as busy as bees, though they had been up constantly then for the greater parts of the <num value="2">two</num> preceding nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>At dark it was reported to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> that the vessel could be moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>In the meantime some coal had been secured (our supply was getting short), and it was determined to run up stream a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> and take it in during the night, and be ready for hot work in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>Therefore we started to move, but had not gone a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> before the same engine broke down again; the crank pin (called a <q direct="unspecified">wrist</q> by Western engineers) of the rock-shaft broke in <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>Fortunately <num value="1">one</num> of the engineers was a blacksmith, so the forge was set up and another pin forged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>But this with our improvised facilities used up the whole night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>Meantime the enemy became aware of our crippled condition, and at daylight moved up to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>The Essex led, and came up very slowly, at a rate not to exceed <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>She had opened on us before the last touch had been given to the pin, but it was finished and the parts thrown together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>As the ship again started ahead <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00209.02392" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> remarked that we were brought to bay by a superior force, and that he should fight it out as long as we would swim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>The battle for the supremacy of the river was upon us, and we must meet the grave responsibility as men and patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>His plan was to go up the river a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> and then turn on and dispatch the <rs>Essex</rs>, then give his attention to the numerous force of wooden vessels which had been assembled since the morning before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>The pleasant sensation of again being afloat and in possession of the power of locomotion, was hardly experienced before our last and final disaster came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>The port engine this time gave way, broke down and would not move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>The engineer was now in despair, he could do nothing, and so reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>The Essex was coming up astern and firing upon us. We had run ashore and were a hopeless, immovable mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>Read was returning the fire, but the <num value="2">two</num> ships <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> were scarcely near enough for the shots to tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>We were not struck by the <rs>Essex</rs>, nor do I think we struck her. An army force was reported by a mounted <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guard</orgName> to be coming up the river to cut off our retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/><persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00210.02393" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> did not call a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName>, but himself assumed the responsibility of burning the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>I recollect the look of anguish he gave me, and the scalding tears were running down his cheeks when he announced his determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Read kept firing at the <rs>Essex</rs> until <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00210.02394" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Henry,K.,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> had set fire to the wardroom and cabin, then all jumped on shore, and in a few moments the flames burst up the hatches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>Loaded shells had been placed at all the guns, which commenced exploding as soon as the fire reached the gun deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>This was the last of the <rs>Arkansas</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>I am aware that the same class of people who accused the <name>Tifts</name> of treason (the stay-at-<orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home-guards</orgName>), were sure that the engineer had caused the engines to break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>I am also aware that many lawyers, doctors, planters, and gentlemen of elegant leisure, who had then been soldiering a <num value="12">twelve</num> month, were sure they could have managed the business much better than the gallant and experienced naval officer who had it in charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>I am also aware that several old, influential and wealthy sugar planters were witnesses of the disaster, and gave it as their solemn and well considered opinion (Jack Bunsby was in the habit of giving <q direct="unspecified">opinions</q> also), that the vessel was <q direct="unspecified">unnecessarily sacrificed!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>I trust that whoever undertakes our naval history will give due weight to the opinions, suspicions and insinuations referred to, always referring to their source.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>We have now told all about the career of our great ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>We have gone with her through fire and smoke, death and destruction; and if the reader is so minded we will go back and learn something more of her. As related in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chapter, she was built a short distance below the city of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> by <persName n="Shirley,Captain,John,T.,," id="n0269.0050.00210.02395" reg="default:Shirley,John,T.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Shirley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>It seems that <persName n="Shirley,Captain,,,," id="n0269.0050.00210.02396" reg="nearbymention:Shirley,John,T.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shirley</surname></persName> organized in the early months of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> what he called a river brigade; but owing to the lack of facilities for operations he was compelled to disband his force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>Not being content, however, to remain idle, he conceived the plan of building a couple of powerful gunboats for river service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>The plan was adopted at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the sum of <measure n="125000dollars" type="currency">$125,000</measure> appropriated for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>This sum was found totally inadequate, and in order to raise funds, which were supplied tardily by the <rs>Government</rs>, <persName n="Shirley,Captain,,,," id="n0269.0050.00210.02397" reg="nearbymention:Shirley,John,T.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shirley</surname></persName> was compelled to sell his homestead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>Nothing daunted, the enthusiastic projector pushed forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>Competent mechanics were scarce, and he sent to <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> for them&mdash;for the <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> army refused to allow the detail of men to work on gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>Thus cramped for want of money and mechanics, the work necessarily progressed slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/><num value="1">One</num> <term type="ship">vessel</term>, the <rs type="ship">Arkansas</rs>, was finally launched before the fall of New Orleans, and the other was burned on the stocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>Upon arriving at the latter place the outlook was certainly anything but encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>There was neither foundry or machine shop in the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>The ship was in a very incomplete condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>The iron of her armor extended only a foot, or a little more, above the water line, and there was not a sufficiency of iron on hand to finish the entire ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>Of guns, we had enough, but were short <num value="4">four</num> carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>In the matter of ammunition and outfit for the battery we were also very deficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>It was fearfully discouraging, but <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0269.0050.00211.02400" reg="nearbymention:Brown,Isaac,Newton,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> was undismayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>He summoned the planters from the neighborhood and asked for laborers, and all the blacksmiths' tools they could furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>In a few days we had several <num value="100">hundred</num> laborers and their overseers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>Numbers of forges were sent in, and the work commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>Besides, on the face of the gorge, the bricks falling down on the sand which we had placed outside, have accumulated until they have built up of themselves a complete breastwork, behind which we can take refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>Like <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> others under similar circumstances, we have become accustomed to the shelling, and there is always some <num value="1">one</num> to crack a joke.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>It was at this time I was anxious to get a brigade to throw down the outer line of works, which would have completely placed that portion of the enemy in the woods between our outer and intermediate lines at our mercy; but owing to a misunderstanding of the officer who conducted these forces they were placed in position improperly, and were of no avail during these repeated attacks upon the right of <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n0269.0055.00228.02592" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Bushrod,R.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>The commanding General will recollect that I before stated that the strength of the enemy was in front of these <num value="2">two</num> brigades, both in position and forces, and therefore great credit should be given them for their actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>At this time I was ordered by the <rs>Division Commander</rs> to change front forward to the right and form line of battle parallel to the turnpike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>In accomplishing this, my left drove the enemy from that portion of their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of works which it struck, and the whole movement was much impeded by the <hi rend="italics">abattis</hi> and wire entanglement referred to.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>In <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> of this year occurred <num value="1">one</num> of those riots which distinguished the close of <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00241.02774" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName>'s administration, and seemed to demonstrate how utterly unfit he was for his elevated position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>A strike for higher wages took place among the negroes of the <name>Cornlaher</name> ricefields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>Whether the negroes had just grounds of complaint against their employers, is a question of no moment whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>A morbid sentiment endeavored to excuse them on the ground of unfair conduct on the part of the planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>It is a sufficient answer to this that the negroes, who by contract lived and worked habitually on the plantations, did not begin the strike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>It began with those who, living elsewhere, were occasionally hired to assist the regular forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>These persons not only refused to work for such wages as were offered them, (which <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> they had a perfect right to do,) but they became lawless, when they compelled the contract hands to stop work also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>It is a high-handed outrage, becoming so common all over the country as to be acquiring the force of unwritten law&mdash;a practice which strikes at the root of all civilization, by making the will of an unreasoning mob, the superior law of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>As soon as men resort to violence to bend others to their wills, all considerations but that of order must give way to the higher <num value="1">one</num> of saving the country from anarchy, and even if the cause is originally right, it becomes thoroughly vitiated when it is attempted to enforce it by violence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>The Governor failed to adopt those decisive measures, which alone could restore order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>A trial justice was appointed to arrest the ringleaders and bring them to punishment, and he issued, through the sheriff, a proclamation full of wisdom and good counsel, but, unfortunately, an offer of amnesty if the rioters would desist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>The appointment of this trial justice seemed to give offence to the negroes, but it does not appear that he took any steps to quell the disturbance, and, indeed, when the <rs>Governor</rs> promised immunity to the guilty, what was the use of proceeding against any <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>Whatever may have been the cause of the disturbance, it was soon converted into a conflict of races, and the hostility of the blacks was excited by all sorts of devices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>Among these was the following parody of a popular hymn, which was sung when the rioters wished to stimulate themselves and encourage others to join them:</p> <lg type="pentameter"><lg type="stanza"> <l>A charge to keep I have,</l> <l>A negro to maintain,</l> <l>A never dying thirst for power,</l> <l>To bind him with a chain.</l></lg> <lg type="stanza"> <l>To sever the present age,</l> <l>Our pockets we must fill;</l> <l>We'll make them work for wages now</l> <l>And never pay the bill.</l></lg> <lg type="stanza"> <l>Arm me with zealous care</l> <l>To make him know his place;</l> <l>And oh thy servants, <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, prepare</l> <l>To rule the negro race.</l></lg> <lg type="stanza"> <l>Help us to rob and shoot</l> <l>The nigger on the sly,</l> <l>Assured if they don't vote for us,</l> <l>They shall forever die.</l></lg></lg> <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>This precious parody bears on its face the mark of a white radical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>The war of races was already begun in the rice-field districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>The disturbances continued for a fortnight, and ended seemingly because, after the negroes had manifested their power, and found that the <rs>Governor</rs> was either unable or unwilling to repress them, they were willing to leave the country quiet until a later season, when they could renew the disturbances and do more mischief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>About the same time an incident occurred in <placeName reg="Edgefield, Edgefield, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095737">Edgefield</placeName> which grew out of the mistrust entertained by the people against the trial by jury as practised in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>It was an act of will-justice perpetrated by white men, with no consideration of party politics, and which was used with telling effect in the bitter contest approaching for the chief magistracy of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>An aged couple named <persName n="Harmon,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00243.02775" reg="mostcommon:Harmon,nomatch:0"><surname>Harmon</surname></persName>, living on the border of <placeName reg="Edgefield, Edgefield, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095737">Edgefield</placeName> and <placeName reg="Abbeville, Abbeville, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095219">Abbeville</placeName>, were found <num value="1">one</num> morning murdered, and there were manifest signs that robbery had been committed and arson attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>Suspicion against certain negroes was soon converted into certainty by the confession of <num value="1">one</num> of them, and <num value="6">six</num> men and <num value="2">two</num> women were brought before the coroner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>A verdict of guilty of murder was brought in against all of them, and the coroner delivered the prisoners to the <rs>Sheriff</rs> to be taken for trial to <placeName reg="Edgefield, Edgefield, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095737">Edgefield</placeName> jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>Some <num value="200">two hundred</num> white men were now present on the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>As soon as the sheriff had received his prisoners he was approached by some men disguised, a sheet thrown around him. He was conveyed to a neighboring house and locked in. Meanwhile the prisoners, all but the women, were led off into the woods and quietly shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Neither the sheriff nor any <num value="1">one</num> else seemed to know the persons who committed this act of violence; but it would be unfair not to add that the public mind was not displeased that summary justice had speedily overtaken the perpetrators of the outrage upon the unhappy old couple, and were not allowed the chance of escape, which a jury trial made so very probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>When law is lax or impotent, society is forced to recur to <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>This is, unfortunately, too often done all over the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but that which in a Northern or Western State is regarded as an occasional and regrettable act of violence, is held, when done at the <rs>South</rs>, as the result of deep design and of premeditated mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>The governor again issued a proclamation, full of moral and political wisdom, but directed against no <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>He wrote to <persName n="Carpenter,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00243.02776" reg="mostcommon:Carpenter,nomatch:0"><surname>Carpenter</surname></persName>, the circuit judge, to urge him to discover the perpetrators of the outrages, and to bring to trial the women who had been found guilty by the coroner's inquest, but spared by the lynchers. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>Meanwhile rumors were rife respecting the conduct and attitude of <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00244.02777" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>It was asserted that the feud between him and <persName n="Patterson,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00244.02778" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,J.,G.,,:1"><surname>Patterson</surname></persName> was to be healed over and certain tamperings with the funds of the <rs>State</rs> effected for their joint benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>To this rumor <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00244.02779" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> gave an indignant denial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>He said that no terms of reconciliation had been offered, and that he would regard any settlement of dissensions in the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> in the <rs>State</rs> which compromised the cause of reform as worse than defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>It was by such declarations as these that he continued to preserve the good will with which he was regarded by many of the <name>Conservatives</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>They saw in him the <num value="1">one</num> man in whom they could hope for any mitigation of radical misrule, and though he often showed deplorable weakness, they would not desert him. They clung to him as their anchor of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>They saw no alternative but to take him with all his imperfectness, and a desperate struggle against fearful odds, in which defeat was certain destruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>Then came the celebration in <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> of <dateStruct value="-06-28"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="28">28th</day></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>This day, peculiarly the day of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> and of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>, has always been celebrated by some of the military companies of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>On this occasion the <rs>Rifle Club</rs>, known as the <rs>Palmetto Club</rs>, had determined to expose to view a monument which they had erected in <placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">White Point</placeName> Garden to commemorate the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> anniversary of the <rs n="Battle of Fort Moultrie" type="battle">battle of Fort Moultrie</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>All the rifle clubs in the city took part in the celebration, together with several companies from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and detachments from companies in New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, which had come to assist in the pageant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>The command for the day was conferred on <persName n="Hampton,General,Wade,,," id="n0269.0061.00244.02780" reg="default:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Wade</foreName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, the chief of the cavalry of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>The Governor was invited to partake of the festivities and cheerfully accepted the invitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>It must be remembered that the rifle clubs were bodies without legal organization, which had sprung into existence at the conduct of <persName n="Scott,Governor,,,," id="n0269.0061.00244.02781" reg="mostcommon:Scott,J.,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, when he refused to reorganize any white militia, and lavishly bestowed arms and ammunition upon the negroes, whom he had organized throughout the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>They were bodies organized under the great law of self-preservation, when it seemed to be the object of the <rs>Governor</rs> to put the whites entirely at the mercy of the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>If <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00244.02782" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> reflected upon the unlawfulness of these organizations he kept his thoughts to himself, and seemed to enter into the spirit of the celebration <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> with as much zeal as any <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>It was not long after that he discovered that they were unlawful and dangerous associations, and brought the whole weight of his own authority, as well as that of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to disarm and suppress them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>But to-day all was calm and bright, and nothing occurred to mar the pleasure of the occasion except the fierce rays of a midsummer's morning sun, which prostrated the troops engaged in the pageant and spoiled the show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>In this pageant were representatives of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>The era of good feeling seemed to have commenced, the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, the <name>Gray</name> and the <rs>Blue</rs>, the <rs>Confederates</rs> and the <rs>Federals</rs>, all united in doing honor to the historic day of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and all marched under the orders of a Confederate General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>The Governor was among the happiest of the guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>This day was <num value="1">one</num> of the last of peace and good will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>On the evening of <dateStruct value="-07-8"><day type="name">Saturday</day>, <month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct>, a conflict arose at <placeName reg="Hamburg, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095935">Hamburg</placeName> between sundry white citizens and a party of blacks, who pretended to be the militia of the <rs>State</rs>, which resulted in the killing of a young man by the the name of <persName n="Merriweather,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00245.02783" reg="mostcommon:Merriweather,nomatch:0"><surname>Merriweather</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>Exasperated at the death of their companion, and unable to make any impression upon the brick house into which the negroes had thrown themselves, the whites sent to <placeName key="tgn,7017498" n="1.000 6" reg="augusta, richmond, georgia">Augusta</placeName> for a piece of artillery, with which they battered the house and drove out the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>It was a story too shocking for belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/></p> 
<p>Having related the general fact of the collision and massacre, I am at a loss to determine how to proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>Though often urged, the government never made this tragedy the subject of a judicial enquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>A coroner's inquest was held, at which an immense amount of the most extravagant testimony (<hi rend="italics">ex parle</hi>) was offered, and subsequently, on proceeding on a <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>, other testimony of a very different character was given by witnesses whose character and standing entitled them to respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>But in neither case did the testimony undergo that sifting and scrutiny which a judicial examination alone can elicit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/><hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Prima">Prima</placeName> facie</hi> the testimony for the government must have been considered insufficient to make a case against the accused; for though repeatedly urged to prosecute, they refused to do so. Another very ugly feature in the case is, that though a coroner's inquest was promptly held to enquire into the death of the negroes, no notice was taken of the death of <persName n="Merriweather,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02787" reg="mostcommon:Merriweather,nomatch:0"><surname>Merriweather</surname></persName>, who was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victim of the affray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>Perhaps the best plan that can be pursued is to tell the story as it was told by each party, beginning with that of <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02788" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> and his <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, <persName n="Stover,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02789" reg="mostcommon:Stover,nomatch:0"><surname>Stover</surname></persName>, which, having an official character, was received as true and greedily swallowed by everybody outside of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>I must premise by saying that the <num value="2">two</num> great parties in the country had selected their candidates for the <name>Presidency</name>, and the contest promised to be bitter and unscrupulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>It was known that the <rs>Southern States</rs>, except those under negro dominion, would support <persName n="Tilden,Mister,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02790" reg="mostcommon:Tilden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tilden</surname></persName>, whose great services in weeding out corruption in New York had commended him to good men all over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>To counteract this favorable opinion, it was the aim of the supporters of <persName n="Hayes,Mister,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02791" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hayes</surname></persName> to stigmatize the cause of <persName n="Tilden,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02792" reg="mostcommon:Tilden,nomatch:0"><surname>Tilden</surname></persName> by representing him as the supporter of Southern outrages upon helpless negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>Any event, therefore, like the <rs>Hamburg</rs> massacre was a godsend to them, as it would wonderfully advance the interest of <persName n="Hayes,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02793" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><surname>Hayes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>Now, when we remember that <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0061.00246.02794" reg="nearbymention:Chamberlain,D.,H.,,"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the accredited leaders of his party in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and that his power was due to the aid which he could obtain from that party, it is not doing him injustice to presume that he would put no gloss over his report of the massacre so as to relieve the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> from any of the odium which attached to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>But men were not in their senses, and anything that would show the <name>Southerners</name> to be fools and madmen was swallowed by the <rs>North</rs> with eager credulity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>The matter was never brought before a court by that officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>He wanted no troops to assist him, and had made no such request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>In this letter he declares that the massacre of <placeName reg="Hamburg, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095935">Hamburg</placeName> had struck terror into the hearts of the negro, and as it was probably made with a view to the approaching elections, it would have the effect of deterring them from the polls, and he more than insinuates that it was a political move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>He says that the demand made by the mob on the militia company for surrendering their arms, with the fact that the militia had not done, nor threatened to do, injury to any <num value="1">one</num> in that community, seems to indicate a purpose to deprive the militia of their rights on account of their color or political associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>Those who made the demand were whites and Democrats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>The firing was concentrated principally on the eastern face, though but little damage was done, save the disabling of <num value="2">two</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>In the evening, the <rs>Ironsides</rs> came in, and we opened on her with considerable spirit for a short while, until she thought it best to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>The casualties were few, but <num value="1">one</num> of our best men had his leg shot off and afterwards amputated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>The former, while he appeared highly pleased and confident, could not help displaying a silent wonder and amazement at the ruined and dilapidated <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> Fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>He says it must be held for <num value="1">one</num> month yet. To-day the firing has been unusually heavy, and, though only <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> casualties, it has resulted in considerable injury to us, in the way of dismounting guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>We have now only <num value="4">four</num> guns fit for immediate service, though these are well protected by sand traverses, and probably will not be hurt at all. Besides, several others are only temporarily disabled, and to-night, when the firing ceases, they can be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/><num value="1">One</num> company was sent out of the <rs>Fort</rs> last night, and to-night another goes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>This will leave <num value="3">three</num> to keep the old machine going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>Our men act splendidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/>No troops probably ever stood with so little concern and for so long a time such a terrific and constant shelling, and the more honor is due to them for such behavior when it is recollected that they do it without being allowed to reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>They have to sit quiet and take it the livelong day. You have no idea what a relief it is at night when the enemy stops pelting us; the feeling is delightful; we feel refreshed and rejoiced, and seem to breathe more freely an air that seems purer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>The eastern face of the <rs>Fort</rs> is very little injured so far, and the <rs>Fort</rs> is still tenable, though no <num value="1">one</num> expects it to be held any length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>The object of holding now is to get time to build or complete batteries on <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James's Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>Powder is being moved out as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>It is not impossible to save them, but it is probable that the guns will be blown up with the <rs>Fort</rs> when we evacuate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>The Fort is so torn to pieces, and there is so much rubbish in it, that it would be a difficult job to get them out, and would require too much energy for we Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>It has come to our ears that the <hi rend="italics">croakers</hi> have already opened their terrific battery, that never ceases firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/><hi rend="italics">My Dear Father</hi>.&mdash;You will have heard, before this reaches you, of the fight with the enemy's monitors this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>They came up, <num value="5">five</num> in number, about <time value="3:30oclock">half-past 3 o'clock</time> and opened on us, in our helpless condition, a most terrific and destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>We had but <num value="1">one</num> solitary gun amid the ruins, the remnant of <num value="35">thirty-five</num> splendid barbette guns, with which to contend against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/>They were within <placeName><distance reg="800yards">800 yards</distance> of the <rs>Fort</rs></placeName>, and could not be seen by the other fortifications on account of the denseness of the fog; so that for some time our single gun was the only <num value="1">one</num> on our side engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>I could scarcely restrain my tears at our helpless situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>It was a sad reflection indeed to think that all our guns were disabled, and that, too, when we so much needed them, and that we had only <num value="1">one</num> with which to fight the sneaking sea-devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>After awhile, however, <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>, <persName n="Bee,,,,," id="n0269.0062.00255.02867" reg="mostcommon:Bee,John,,,:1"><surname>Bee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Simpkins,,,,," id="n0269.0062.00255.02868" reg="mostcommon:Simpkins,John,,,:1"><surname>Simpkins</surname></persName>, <persName n="Gregg,,,,," id="n0269.0062.00255.02869" reg="mostcommon:Gregg,Irvin,,,:1"><surname>Gregg</surname></persName>, all opened, and, after a hot fight of <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, in which we in the <rs>Fort</rs> were the only ones to suffer, the enemy thought fit to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>I need not speak of the injury that we sustained, for we could scarcely be injured more than we already were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>The reason of the enemy's appearance this morning was doubtless on account of their belief that the <rs>Fort</rs> was abandoned; for, before we opened, a launch filled with troops was seen approaching the <rs>Fort</rs>, and was quite near the wharf when we gave the alarm, whereupon the launch was seen to return hurriedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>The garrison had been ordered previously to turn out with small arms to defend the <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> ruins against an assault, and when the launch was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered it was thought to be a storming party, but it was evidently only a small force to take possession of the <rs>Fort</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>The enemy were doubtless induced to believe that the <rs>Fort</rs> was evacuated from the fact that no evening gun was fired yesterday&mdash;a thing so unusual, and which was caused partly by neglect and partly by an accident.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>We have endured another day's hard shelling and pelting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>It is now just after dark, and not a sound salutes the ear. The whole harbor seems at rest and quiet; whether <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are or not, I cannot tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>We look for the monitors to come up again in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>How I wish we had something with which to fight them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>I was officer of the guard yesterday, and during the fight this morning had to remain at the sally-port with my guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>I had a dangerous post, being in the line of fire, but fortunately escaped untouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/><num value="1">One</num> of my men was killed, and <num value="7">seven</num> negroes, who were taking protection in the casemates with me, were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>There were an unusual number of casualties to-day, particularly as to officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>A shell burst just over the mess-room while several officers were at dinner, wounding slightly the <rs>Colonel</rs>, Adjutant and ordnance officer, together with a negro waiter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>It seems to be the policy of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0269.0062.00256.02870" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> to hold the <rs>Fort</rs> at all hazards until he gets his fortifications completed on <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James</placeName> and <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Islands</placeName>, when we will probably be sent to the latter place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>I don't think that the enemy will make an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>If they do, however, they will find it an ugly little job.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/><hi rend="italics">My Dear Mother</hi>:&mdash;It gratified me much to receive your kind letter yesterday evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>It so happened that I read it at the same time that I received the <rs>Charleston</rs> papers containing the vile, brutal, uncivilized demand of the wretch who commands the <rs>Yankee</rs> forces in this department, and its pure, pious, trustful spirit, representing the <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> mothers and daughters of our noble old city, against whom (for it was meant for no others to suffer by it) the atrocious demand was made had the effect to increase, if that were possible, the deep feeling of disgust and revenge that I already harbored in my breast, from witnessing on <persName n="Saterday,,,,," id="n0269.0062.00257.02872" reg="mostcommon:Saterday,nomatch:0"><surname>Saterday</surname></persName> morning the unprecedented act that he threatened, actually performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>And now, before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I vow that if such an act is repeated, and I am ever placed in a situation to take revenge, I shall neither give nor ask quarter, but slaughter every wretch that comes within my power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>I know this is a change from the views and principles that I have heretofore entertained; but my principles can have no force when my feelings are so touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/>Such an act forewarns us what we may expect at the hands of <persName n="Gilmore,General,,,," id="n0269.0062.00257.02873" reg="mostcommon:Gilmore,William,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gilmore</surname></persName>; and, while it demonstrates his brutality, it demonstrates still more his weakness and recklessness, and however well he has seemingly conducted affairs in this attack, I venture to predict that he is not a man of ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0269.0062.00257.02874" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:1"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s reply everybody considers excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>The General can write if he can't fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>The enemy's battery in the marsh, from which the shots were fired on the city, can be seen plainly from here, and has only <num value="1">one</num> gun mounted, and at such a distance (<measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>) no <num value="1">one</num> thinks that it can injure the city materially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>We cannot imagine any other object that <persName n="Gilmore,General,,,," id="n0269.0062.00257.02875" reg="mostcommon:Gilmore,William,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gilmore</surname></persName> could have had, save malicious spite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>He could not have supposed that by firing on the city he would compel the surrender of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris's Island</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>He is chagrined that he cannot, with his all-powerful combined force, make <num value="2">two</num> poor little batteries crumble before him; that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, though knocked to pieces, still continued to show fight; and that he has expended on the latter alone <measure n="100000l." type="pounds"><num value="100000">100,000</num> pounds</measure> of powder and <measure n="1000000l." type="pounds"><num value="1000000">1,000,000</num> pounds</measure> of wrought iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>But, though he cannot boast of having whipped us at all, much less in <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>, he cannot <hi rend="italics">injure</hi> us much more than he has already.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>I told you in my last that we had but <num value="1">one</num> serviceable gun. Since then, however, we have rigged up <num value="2">two</num> others that were disabled, which, though the parapet is knocked away in front of both, we expect to fight in case the <rs>Ironclads</rs> try us again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>The <rs>Generals</rs> tried to make him shoulder the responsibility of abandoning the <rs>Fort</rs>, the other day, by endeavoring to induce him to say the <rs>Fort</rs> was untenable; to which he replied that he intended to hold the <rs>Fort</rs> until he received orders, and that if they refused, on his applying, to give him any, he would then not sacrifice his garrison, <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> but leave when <hi rend="italics">he</hi> thought fit. From all I can learn, the <rs>Fort</rs> is to be held for the present, and now the best guns are being removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3756"/>It is a slow and difficult work, however, and it is only at night that we can do anything at all. You may suppose that there is danger, while in a helpless condition, of our being taken prisoners by being cut off, but rest assured that there is not the remotest probability of any such occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/>You know by this time that I always tell you exactly what I think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3758"/>We cannot be taken otherwise than by a storming party, and though the <rs>Yankees</rs> are smart enough to undertake almost any job, I give them credit for being a little <hi rend="italics">too smart</hi> to take the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3759"/>Probably it would not pay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>They have advanced their saps to within <measure n="400yards" type="distance">400 yards</measure> of the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>Our loss was <measure n="6" type="killed">six killed</measure> and <measure n="25" type="wounded">twenty-five wounded</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>The firing continued on us all day yesterday, but nothing like so rapidly as previously; and while I write this morning, the firing is going on slowly again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4225"/>My attention was soon called to our own surroundings; for as the mist rose in our front it brought us in view of the enemy's sharpshooters, and before reaching the trenches we lost several men. We had hardly settled in line and taken in the bearings of our new position, and given the men, in camp parlance, time to <q direct="unspecified">look into their haversacks and grow fat,</q> before orders were brought by a dismounted courier (as no man could have lived a minute mounted), to fall in, and be ready to charge the enemy's works when the signal was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4226"/><q direct="unspecified">Here's your rations, boys,</q> the men called to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4227"/>Fighting rations, they meant, which they thought were given without stint, and wanted to be a little sarcastic to the <rs>Colonel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4228"/>But every man drew his waist belt a little tighter, drew down his hat closer over his eyes, looked once more to his accoutrements, and waited with bated breath the order to clear our works and charge the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4229"/>Just here let me add that the fire from the enemy's picket line by sharpshooters had been so severe that a hat elevated above the works would be perforated by bullets in a few moments, and the order to prepare to charge meant that some who mounted that parapet would look their last of earth from its summit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4230"/>Want of stick upon the part of the enemy alone was the cause of our <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> loss not being much heavier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4231"/>The order came quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4232"/>At the command <q direct="unspecified">Forward!</q>&mdash;rungout in loud tones all along the line&mdash;the regiment bounded forward as <num value="1">one</num> man, with the old yell that rings in my ears as I now write, and starts my old blood in fresh surges through my veins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4233"/>As the ground in our front between us and the enemy was covered with felled timber, no alignment could be kept; there was <num value="1">one</num> mad rush, and but few laggards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4234"/>Our batteries opened with every gun, and with <num value="1">one</num> desultory fire we carried the enemy's lines and captured over a <measure n="100" type="prisoners">hundred prisoners</measure> who did not know enough English to surrender.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4235"/>The enemy's camps furnished the rations we failed to get in the morning, and the old regiment, with the loss of <num value="1">one</num> field officer and <num value="30">thirty</num> men killed and wounded, stood ready the next day to still farther tighten the cords around <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0269.0069.00294.03297" reg="mostcommon:Butler,M.,C.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s lines in <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundreds">Bermuda Hundreds</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>Meanwhile the <rs>State</rs> generally, and the low country particularly was drifting into chaos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/>I have already mentioned the alarming riots which had disturbed the labor in the rice-fields of the <rs>Combahee</rs> district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4510"/>These seemed to have subsided of themselves, perhaps with the design of another and more serious disturbance, when it would produce more serious results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4511"/>There was quiet in that region, but no sense of security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/>Those who had presumed to put themselves above the law, and to determine that men should not work but on terms which they should dictate, had felt, not the power, but the imbecility of the government&mdash;nay, the <rs>Governor</rs>, while condemning the lawless acts, had more than intimated that they had grievances which ought to be redressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/>In <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> the riots recommenced, not only more formidable in their dimensions, but occurring just when the rice was ready for the harvest, promised to spread desolation over the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4514"/>The plantations were visited by mobs who went into the rice-fields, stopped all who were disposed to work, and flogged all who did not readily yield to their orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4515"/>Information was quickly forwarded to the <rs>Governor</rs>, who directed a trial justice to issue warrants, and the sheriff to summon a posse to arrest the guilty parties, if it took the last man in the county to make the arrests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4516"/>Several men were arrested and put in charge of a constable to be carried to jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4517"/>They were rescued by the strikers and <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> set at liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4518"/>Then came <persName n="Gleaves,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00317.03444" reg="mostcommon:Gleaves,nomatch:0"><surname>Gleaves</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</rs>, like a <hi rend="italics">Deus ex machina</hi>, to make peace, and the peace which he made was actually praised, even by the <rs>Democratic</rs> papers.

To this mockery of government the leaders made no objection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>They submitted, took a pleasant jaunt to the <rs type="place">Court-house</rs>, and the next day were released, according to the terms of the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>And this was the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Governor">Lieutenant-Governor</rs>'s method of upholding the majesty of the law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>But he did not answer the telegram.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>He was not in <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> to receive it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/>At the moment that telegram was sent he was calmly sitting in the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>'s office</orgName> preparing for the advent of the man on horseback which would insure a free election in the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>After a time the sheriff appeared on the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>He began work by organizing a <hi rend="italics">posse</hi> of colored men to arrest the leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>The strikers resisted, and the <hi rend="italics">posse</hi> was driven off and took refuge in <persName n="Bissell,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00317.03450" reg="mostcommon:Bissell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bissell</surname></persName>'s store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>They were immediately surrounded by the strikers who breathed curses and vengeance against them, and kept them in confinement all that night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>Among the prisoners were about <num value="30">thirty</num> members of a rifle-club, who were taken to serve as a <hi rend="italics">posse</hi>. Their task was a difficult and a delicate <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>They had every reason to believe that nothing would be so pleasing to the government as an act of violence on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>They had observed that while no negro was safe from the violence of the mob, no white man was in peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>They were insulted and provoked, but no violence was offered them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>It was evidently the <pb id="p.318" n="318"/> design of the supreme directors that a few negroes should be killed, not in self-defence, but to punish insults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>These men could have extricated themselves from their confinement, but it might be at the the loss of some lives, and they determined to forbear, and not do the thing which they believed their enemies wished them to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>And here let me deign to say a few words to account for the conduct of the white men during all the stormy scenes that were enacted until the contest was closed by the triumph of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>Many persons were grieved and astonished that the people should so tamely submit to outrageous insults which were often offered by the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>When just before the election <persName n="Hampton,Governor,,,," id="n0269.0071.00318.03451" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,Wade,,,:9"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> was escorted through the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> by his enthusiastic friends, the streets were thronged with negroes, both men and women, who saluted him as he passed with the most filthy and abusive language, and the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of friends who made the escort bore it all with patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>Nay, when <num value="1">one</num> negro, more audacious than the rest, ran up to the <rs>General</rs>'s carriage and used such foul language that a policeman on duty (the policemen were all radicals) felt himself compelled, for decency's sake, to arrest the foul-mouthed rioter, the <rs>General</rs> begged forgiveness for him because he knew not what he did. The spirit manifested by the great leader on this occasion was the same spirit felt by all of his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>It was universally believed that what the <name>Republicans</name> most wanted was an outrage on the blacks by the whitest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>A batch of such, even if well imagined, would have been greedily received by <persName n="Chamberlain,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00318.03452" reg="mostcommon:Chamberlain,Daniel,H.,,:5"><surname>Chamberlain</surname></persName> and his associates and published throughout the <rs>North</rs> in the interest of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>It was a wise policy, therefore, to refuse to do that which their enemies anxiously desired them to do. Hence a spirit of forbearance, manifested on all occasions, which was harder to exercise because the negroes mistook its meaning, construed it as timidity, and became the more aggressive in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>As I have said, the <rs>Rifle Club</rs>, in duress in <persName n="Bissell,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00318.03453" reg="mostcommon:Bissell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bissell</surname></persName>'s store, forbore to release themselves, lest it might occasion the killing of some negroes, and sent for <persName n="Gleaves,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00318.03454" reg="mostcommon:Gleaves,nomatch:0"><surname>Gleaves</surname></persName> to come to their assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>During the day <rs>Gleaves</rs> did come, but he had pressing business of his own which called him to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>Aid, however, did come in the person of Lowells, the member of Congress, who dispersed the mob. Meanwhile it was proposed in <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 6" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> to send efficient aid to the authorities, and application was made to the <rs>Governor</rs>, who, as usual, sent his chief constable, Laws, to visit the disturbed districts and report on their situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4551"/>Laws reported that, since the appearance <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> of Lowells, all was quiet and peace restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>But the peace of Lowells was short-lived and delusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>On the night of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> <persName n="Roberts,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00319.03455" reg="mostcommon:Roberts,W.,P.,,:1"><surname>Roberts</surname></persName>' store at <placeName reg="Enslow's Cross-Roads">Enslow's Cross-Roads</placeName> was burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>The next day men, women and children, armed with clubs, paraded the different plantations on the <rs>Combahee</rs> and <rs>Ashford</rs>, and beat or threatened with violence all negroes who were at work or disposed to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>The rioters always asserted that they were acting in obedience to instructions from the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>This was doubtless not true; but it was fairly presumable from the conduct of those whose duty it was to keep the peace and preserve order, that their inefficient conduct was not disapproved by those in authority, and therefore the ignorant and deluded rioters might without absurdity have inferred that the <rs>Governor</rs> approved of that which his subordinates did not seem to condemn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>Again the <rs>Governor</rs> was informed of the renewal of the violence, and again he had recourse to trial-justices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>The blacks, the objects of the rioters' vengeance, themselves implored the aid of the <rs>Governor</rs> in the following touching telegram:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>The ordinary means had been tried and failed for <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>. The governor could not turn from his high purpose of securing freedom of election to attend to such petty matters as giving tranquility to <num value="2">two</num> counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>This work might be left to a trial-justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>The rifle clubs were then ready to assist to restore peace and tranquility, but the <rs>Governor</rs> had a motive for ignoring them, which appeared afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4567"/>The militia had been once or twice called, but they fraternized with the rioters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4568"/>At last <persName n="Terry,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00319.03457" reg="nearbymention:Terry,T.,M.,,"><surname>Terry</surname></persName>, the sheriff &mdash; of <persName n="Colleton,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00319.03458" reg="mostcommon:Colleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Colleton</surname></persName>, sent to the <rs>Governor</rs> that he was utterly helpless and unable to preserve the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>With this letter he sent the warrants which he had been unable to serve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>The Governor sent back the warrants with directions that they were to be kept until the arrival of the <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>To them was to be committed the police duty of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>(It may as well be stated here, that the troops were never sent into that neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>Their services were wanted elsewhere to intimidate the whites, and so protect the polls that the <name>Radicals</name> might win).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>While imbecility was thus permitting lawlessness to run riot in <persName n="Colleton,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00320.03459" reg="mostcommon:Colleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Colleton</surname></persName>, the <rs>Radical Sheriff</rs> of <placeName reg="Beaufort, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013364">Beaufort</placeName>, <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00320.03460" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,James,,,:3"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, appeared on the scene and showed how easily the troubles might have been nipped in the bud had the <rs>Government</rs> wished or dared to stop them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/>Without a <hi rend="italics">posse</hi>, with no aid beyond a strong will and a revolver, judiciously displayed, <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0269.0071.00320.03461" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,James,,,:3"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName> appeared in the mob and arrested the leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4576"/>The prisoners were carried to the <rs>Beaufort</rs> jail, and a short time afterwards were tried and acquitted of the charges which were brought against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4577"/>This was little encouragement for a good officer to go on in the way of enforcing the law. But by this time the riot had run its course; it had done nearly all the mischief it had intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4578"/>The harvest season was nearly over, and as troubles of a serious nature were rife in other parts of the <rs>State</rs>, the rioters were no longer the sole object of attention, and by degrees the country was quiet, if not at peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4579"/>A dangerous lesson had been taught to an ignorant and half-savage people, that violence was above law, and that the <rs>Government</rs> had no power which they were bound to respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>It is proper that I should give some insight into the difficulties which surrounded a cavalry soldier before I enter directly upon my narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>Very few soldiers of the other arms of the service have examined into this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>Many have fancied that they would have been delighted to have had an opportunity for such an easy berth; that the bugle's call for boots and saddles, followed by the note to mount, was a pleasant pastime, and that moving out to the front, to dare the field, was nothing, <q direct="unspecified">as they had to follow and do the work.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>Remember, it takes a fusion of the best metals to make a fine-toned bell, and it takes the same sort of fusion or mixture in a body of soldiers to make an army; and when many a gallant cavairy <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> soldier fell in front of the army in a charge, and laid there <q direct="unspecified">for pavement to the abject rear, like an entered tide they rush by and leave him hindmost, his good office and services too soon forgotten.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>Each cavalryman had to supply himself with a horse and turn it over to the <rs>Government</rs> (have him mustered in), for which the <rs>Government</rs> agreed to pay him <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> a month and to supply him food and shoes and nails, and a blacksmith to do his shoeing, free of expense to him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>It was a Government of our own making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>Experience soon demonstrated that we must help the <rs>Government</rs>, and its need demanded our best efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>We were in a war, and <q direct="unspecified">he was not worthy of the honeycomb that shuns the hive because the bees have stings.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/></p> 
<p>A soldier can cheerfully submit to personal privations and toil, his mind and spirit keeps him buoyant, but a horse loses spirit and strength, and the more spirit he has the worse it is for him as soon as his rations are cut down and double duty imposed upon him. We could get grass sometimes, when corn could not be had, and when in camp they could live; but the finest horse in the best physical condition, casting a shoe on a rough, rocky road and forced rapidly over it, will be rendered wholly unfit for service in half a day. The cavalry were used as couriers, scouts, guides&mdash;the eyes and ears of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>They were expected to move promptly and quickly, the loss of a shoe was not taken as a valid excuse when dispatch was demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>Few men well enough off to furnish their own horses, could nail on a <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoe</rs> (if he had the tools), and if he had extra shoes and nails in his saddle-pocket, and the company's blacksmith was sick or absent, what could he do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>The service was too precarious to admit of wagons accompanying an expedition, so that, with the best management, it often happened neither shoes, nails or smith could be had.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>It took many horses for each man during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of the war. When the war commenced it was an easy matter to secure a horse, but the demand increased so rapidly and the number decreased at a so much greater ratio that at last it would cost <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> pay in Confederate money to purchase a good cavalry horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>The Government only agreed to pay for horses killed in battle, and it would take weeks and sometimes months to get the money after all the papers had gone through the <q direct="unspecified">tape of office in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>Many a cavalryman mortgaged his property to supply himself with horses, and had to pay in greenbacks after the war what was expected of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>The Government was very short of transportation; it could not send the men and horses back to their homes when necessary to exchange their <hi rend="italics">jaded ones</hi> for fresh horses; neither would it pay the extra expense he incurred to accomplish this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>Take this illustration: A member of a company, whose home was in <placeName reg="Washington, Rhode Island, United States" key="tgn,1002996">Washington county</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, has his horse wounded near <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Shepherdstown, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119949">Shepherdstown, in Jefferson county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>To keep that animal in camp to consume the scanty rations doled out to the active horses reported for duty was poor management; but we had no men detailed at camp for that purpose, and yet a cavalryman without a horse during an active campaign was a mere <q direct="unspecified">camp dog,</q> and the good soldiers would not stay there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>The only thing to be done was to start him as soon after the horse was unfit as the papers could be gotten ready, and if the horse was kept <hi rend="italics">too</hi> long in camp it was just that much added to his difficulties in getting home, and when we were actively engaged in the field the difficulties of getting the papers promptly was a severe tax upon the <name>Adjutants</name> of regiments and the <name>Assistant</name>-Adjutants of brigades, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5083"/>That portion of the <orgName n="Southern Railroad" type="railroad">Southern railroad</orgName> between <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0269.0081.00358.03813" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:11"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was in a miserable and even dangerous condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/>Accidents occurred almost daily, engines being broken up, and there being a lamentable scarcity of any species of cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>This, the great thoroughfare to <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, was entirely out of repair and almost impassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>The obstruction offered to transportation by such a thoroughfare can easily be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>Notwithstanding all these difficulties, <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was sufficiently provisioned to hold out for <measure n="40days" type="date">forty days</measure>, and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> sustained a siege of <measure n="7weeks" type="date">seven weeks</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/>As above stated, the effective garrison of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> numbered <num value="18000">eighteen thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5089"/>This small force, directed by the untiring vigilance of the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> commanding, and defended by his engineering skill, were enabled to repel the repeated assaults of an enemy flushed with success and numbering, at the lowest estimate, some <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> men. All confess that the defence of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was resolute and gallant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>Soon after the investment <rs>Grant</rs> attempted to carry the place by <num value="2">two</num> general assaults, apparently bringing his whole army to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>His columns, hurled upon the resolute garrison, were as often hurled back with heavy loss, and leaving <num value="5">five</num> stands of colors in our hands, and the field for miles strewn with his dead, he was compelled to fall back and sit down to a formal investment of the place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>During the siege, the enginerring skill of the commander and his fertility and expedients, were conspicuously displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>Works which under the unceasing and concentrated fire of hundreds of guns were demolished, reappeared in improved forms which could be suggested only by consummate ingenuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>Works built to withstand guns used in ordinary warfare, were found wholly inadequate to resist the heavy metal of the enemy, and subjected to incessant and galling fire of musketry, the artillery could with difficulty be worked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>Here it was particularly that the ingenuity of the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> was exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>The position of the pieces was constantly changing; embankments disappeared under the fire of the enemy's guns, but the artillery would still be found in position, and stronger than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>No difficulty could occur for which an expedient was not at hand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>But energy and ingenuity although tending to postpone, could <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> not prevent the <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">fall of Vicksburg</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>At the beginning of the siege, it was understood and confidently expected that a force from without would relieve the garrison; and this hope sustained the soldiery and the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> during the protracted struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>But this hope, continually deferred, and finally abandoned, resolved the matter into a question of time and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>Honor was considered to have been sufficienty vindicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>The time it was considered had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>The soldiers who for <measure n="48days" type="date">forty-eight days</measure> and nights, vigilant and undaunted, had watched and fought in the trenches, were worn out. A <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName> of the besieging army was confidently anticipated on the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and it was improbable that the garrison, exhausted by fatigues, and diminished to <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num>, would be able to withstand this overwhelming assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>The lines of the enemy at some points, were within a few yards of our own; their mines sapped our works at numerous points, and were supposed to be only awaiting springing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>Attempts to countermine were made, but of course not always successfully, and in <num value="1">one</num> of these endeavors, the enemy sprung a mine loaded with a ton of powder, blowing up <num value="80">eighty</num> of our men, some of whom were then engaged in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>Believing themselves to be undermined, the men were becoming restive in the trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>Provisions also were at a low ebb; it would have been impossible under any circumstances to hold out much longer; and should the place be carried by assault, no terms could be expected, and all the horrors of a sacked city were to be anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>The only alternative was to cut through the enemy's lines, or to capitulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>There being no hope of relief, a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> of the <rs>General</rs> officers was called, and this alternative presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>It was the opinion of the majority, that it was physically impossible for the men to cut through the enemy's lines and carry the works obstructing their exit&mdash;works known to be as formidable as our own. The minority (among whom was the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant General</rs> commanding,) were of a contrary opinion, and advocated an attempt to cut their way out. The opinion of the majority prevailed, the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> yielding to their discretion; and preparations for the negotiation of terms were entered upon&mdash;with what success is before the public.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>After the surrender, the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs> commanding remained with his army, attending to their wants; and shared with them the hardships of the march to Enterprise, where the <orgName n="Army of Vicksburg" type="army">army of Vicksburg</orgName> was dissolved on parole.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5609"/>The ditch was the dead line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5610"/>We were commanded not to get in it, or cross it, on penalty of being shot.

<p>These precautions made escape so hazardous that an attempt was seldom made, and very few of those who tried succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5614"/>The favorite method for a time was tunnelling, but after the ditch was dug, efforts in that direction ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5616"/>Plans of escape were continually formed, but none would bear the test of an attempt, and so as day after day passed by, the stern conviction forced itself upon each <num value="1">one</num> of the new comers that they would have to remain there until the war ended &mdash; the old prisoners had already resigned themselves to that prospect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5622"/>We were always as hungry as ravenous wolves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/>There was such a craving for food that we would eat the young hickory-nuts growing in the yard&mdash;hull, shell, and all.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5625"/>My constant thought was how to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5627"/><num value="1">One</num> evening a few of us were walking in the prison-yard, and stopped near the ditch, opposite the large gate constituting the main entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5628"/>For some reason, which we never pondered, the sentinels on that side of the fence were not so numerous as elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5631"/>My heart sank when he uttered the last words, for nothing seemed easier, and I knew that not more than <num value="1">one</num> could make the venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5632"/>The next day nothing was said about it. The day after I <pb id="p.397" n="397"/> asked <persName n="Buck,,,,," id="n0269.0088.00397.04278" reg="mostcommon:Buck,nomatch:0"><surname>Buck</surname></persName> if he was still in the notion of going to the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5633"/>He answered, <q direct="unspecified">No.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5634"/>I resolved then to try it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>As soon as the sentinels opposite had their backs turned&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> going up, the other down the fence&mdash;I jumped into the ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5636"/>I did not then attempt to go further, but, closely hugging the opposite bank, dug holes for my hands and feet, so when the time came there would be no delay in getting out. Presently <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Laurie,,Annie,,," id="n0269.0088.00397.04279" reg="default:Laurie,Annie,,,"><foreName>Annie</foreName> <surname>Laurie</surname></persName></q> was whistled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5637"/>It was the signal agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5638"/>By it I knew that the sentinels were relatively in the same positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/>Without hesitating a moment, I clambered out of the ditch and ran to the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>A friendly wheelbarrow was near, which I had calculated on making use of. To my consternation, it was so low I could barely lie flat under it. It was impossible to stay under it and work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/>However, I placed it against the fence, and then commenced with a caseknife to dig. When the sentinel above approached (I could plainly hear every step), I crawled under the wheelbarrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>It did not afford much protection, only covering my body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>He or any sentinel up or down the fence could easily have seen me, for I was not more than <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> from a lamp that shed the brightness of day all around.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5644"/>At <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> the bugle warned prisoners to their barracks, and my work had just fairly begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/>The friend who made the signal was to follow me, but after the bugle sounded I knew there was no chance for him. The prisoners retired to their quarters, and soon no sound was to be heard except the tread of the sentinels above.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5646"/>It did not take me long to dig the hole; a very small <num value="1">one</num> was sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5647"/>In a few minutes it was completed, and I squeezed through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5648"/>The danger outside was as great as that I had already encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>True, I was beneath the platform on which the sentinels walked, but the guard-house was just in front; a large lamp was burning near it; the fence was whitewashed, and a soldier was walking by, not more than <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>I laid still until he passed, and then, as fast as possible, crawled down the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5651"/>There was no sense in trying to creep where there was so much light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5652"/>Soon I came to a large bush, behind which I hid. At <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> tattoo was beat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5653"/>The soldiers retired to their quarters; the last straggler soon passed by, and silence reigned supreme.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5654"/>The next difficulty was to get away from the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5655"/>I crawled further, until I came to a point beneath <num value="2">two</num> sentinels, who were conversing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5656"/><pb id="p.398" n="398"/> I knew they would not stay together long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5657"/>Presently they separated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5658"/>When a short distance apart, I stepped out. The noise of the stones crunching under my feet was heard by <num value="1">one</num>, who stopped, looked at me, and took his gun from his shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/>My heart beat a reveille.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>It seemed as if my hopes were to be frustrated in the very moment of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>However, I kept evenly on, occasionally glancing over my left shoulder at the sentinel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5662"/>He seemed to change his mind, replaced his gun, and resumed his walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5723"/><num value="4">No. 4</num> was a large barrack on the north side of the prison, about <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> from the ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5724"/>The crowd, as if to nerve themselves for their desperate effort, had made a temporary halt behind it. There seemed to be about <num value="60">sixty</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5726"/>It was natural for the front rank to hesitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>That honor, however, was not reserved for me. I was within <num value="10">ten</num> steps of the front, when the whole crowd, as if actuated by <num value="1">one</num> impulse, rushed forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5731"/>Into the ditch we went, regardless of the volley fired at us, and up on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>There, planting our ladders against the fence, we almost flew over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>After firing <num value="1">one</num> volley, which seemed to miss us all, as no <num value="1">one</num> fell, the guard scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>When the foremost man reached the top only <num value="1">one</num> sentinel was left, and he appeared to be too frightened to run. The whole prisonful could have gone out at that gap.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>Outside we all scattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5736"/>A corn-field was to be traversed, and beyond that was timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5737"/>On reaching it I turned obliquely to the left, ran in that direction a few minutes, then made another left turn, and soon came to a road some distance west from the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5739"/>I was now south of the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5740"/>The pursuit would naturally be on the north side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>The experience of history teaches us that in a war of <num value="2">two</num> nations of unequal strength and resources, the weaker <num value="1">one</num> can save herself only by being constantly on the offensive, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>This is so demonstrable a fact, that it might be taken as a basis for a principle or rule of action in such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>Nothing is more exhaustive of national vitality and prosperity than war, because war is organized and scientific destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>Therefore, between <num value="2">two</num> belligerants, the chances of final triumph are in favor of the stronger, and the ratio of those chances is in proportion to the duration of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5819"/>It has been said by a great captain that, <q direct="unspecified">in the end, victory always favors the big battalions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>Several instances, however, are on record where the weaker in the field crushed a much more powerful enemy than himself by a well-concerted multiplicity and rapidy of attacks and startling manoeuvres, inspired by genius and executed with a boldness that struck the world with admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5821"/>To cripple severely an adversary at the onset is to secure a strong card out of the pack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>A duel between <num value="2">two</num> nations is like a duel between <num value="2">two</num> individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5823"/>A man who never wielded a sword, when put in front of a master of the art of fencing, is lost, if he waits for the deadly thrust of his adversary, who will strike with a gladiatorial accuracy that will not be parried by the untrained and unskillful hand of mere courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>The only chance for his almost defenceless combatant is, as soon as steel touches steel, to take the initiative, and by the precipitation of lightning-like strokes, aimed at the breast of his adversary, to risk at once the possibility of a lucky hit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5828"/>It was the system of concentration, to operate against fractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5829"/>He never was tempted to disseminate his forces for the purpose of protecting any portion or the whole of his provinces with the fragments of a broken and insufficient shield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5830"/>The army, gathered around his person, was the seat of government, and that government became as nomadic as the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>The whole of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> was repeatedly overrun and plundered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>He made no attempt to cover scattered localities because they clamored for it, and, rising above sectional wish and interest, he occupied no point that was not of extreme strategic importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5834"/>He abandoned the limbs and provided only for the safety of the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5835"/>His camp was the heart of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/>As long as that heart was kept pulsating, the blood might again return to the withered limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>He allowed whole provinces to be depopulated, and any number of cities and towns and villages to be devastated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5838"/>It was terrible, but it was comparatively nothing to him, provided he had a horse to mount, a crust of bread to eat, an army to command, and could keep his forces concentrated in the palm of his heroic hand, ready to strike in every direction; and after <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> of as bloody a war as ever was fought, during which he never deviated from his system of concentration and incessant aggression against his enemies, whom he contrived to attack when isolated and separated from <num value="1">one</num> another, he succeeded, by his own genius and by an unexpected turn of the wheel of fortune, in securing an honorable and advantageous peace, although he had been hopeless during the whole struggle, and had carried poison in his pocket to end his life rather than be taken prisoner, so tremendous were the odds against this man of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5852"/>The aggressive system was thus made subordinate to the protective and defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5853"/>On the other hand, it was the reverse that was invariably advocated in the plans presented by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0269.0089.00409.04333" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<p> <num value="574">574</num>. The war once over, all reasonable men were ready to join in repairing its wastes and forgetting its enmities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>Doubtless there were selfish Northern adventurers, who cared only to make their own fortunes out of the poverty of the exhausted <rs>South</rs> and the ignorance of the freedmen; while there were disappointed politicians, who, having failed to destroy the <rs>Government</rs>, used every opportunity to obstruct its action.

<p><num value="581">581</num>. If we ask what was gained by all this suffering and expenditure of life and treasure, we find that the <rs>South</rs>, before the war was over, gave up the <num value="2">two</num> principles for which it was ostensibly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>The right of secession was indeed a principle which no government could admit, and, notwithstanding its assertion of State sovereignty, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was from the very beginning more strongly centralized than the <rs>Union</rs> had ever been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>Its leaders found, just as their fathers had found in Revolutionary times (&sect; <num value="234">234</num>), that a rope of sand is not strong enough to bear the strain of war. <num value="1">One</num> flag, <num value="1">one</num> uniform, were seen all through the <rs>South</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> will at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> controlled all movements.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6085"/></p> 
<p>We yesterday had a conversation with a gentleman who was present at the time the negotiations for the surrender were going on, in which he asserted most positively that these negotiations were carried on under a large apple tree in a farm-yard, and that, according to his <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> recollection, there were no pine trees near the spot, as it is stated by <persName n="Paris,Doctor,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04524" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Paris</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6086"/>He says that when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04525" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:19"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> met the commissioners appointed by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04526" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the curiosity of every <num value="1">one</num> was aroused, and every excuse was made to get near the spot where the parties were discussing the terms of the surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/>To keep these off and prevent interruption, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> of Engineers, under <persName n="Talcott,Colonel,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04527" reg="mostcommon:Talcott,T.,M.,R.,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Talcott</surname></persName>, of which our informant was a member, was formed in a hollow square around the assembled officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>They occupied camp stools, and had a table on which the writing was done, and they were seated under the shade of a large apple tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6089"/><persName n="Talcott,Colonel,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04528" reg="mostcommon:Talcott,T.,M.,R.,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Talcott</surname></persName>'s reigiment formed around them, prevented any interruption until the preliminary papers were signed, and the <rs>Federal</rs> officers left for <placeName><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04529" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6090"/>This was, we think our informant stated, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>On the <name>Tuesday</name> following he had occasion to pass the spot, and not a vestige of the apple tree was left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6092"/>Even the roots of the tree were dug up and carried away as mementoes of the great occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6093"/>It may have been that the surrender was consummated at some other place, but the negotiations certainly took place under the <quote>apple tree at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>,</quote> and there is no <quote>myth</quote> about this celebrated tree.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6094"/>Now, the gentleman referred to was simply mistaken in his facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6095"/>The truth is that no <q direct="unspecified">negotiations</q> ever occurred under an <q direct="unspecified">apple tree</q>&mdash;that the <q direct="unspecified">negotiations</q> were not through <q direct="unspecified">commissioners,</q> but between <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04530" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:19"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04531" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Grant</surname></persName> themselves&mdash;and that they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met, not <q direct="unspecified">under an apple tree,</q> but in the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="McLean house">McLean house</placeName></q> at <placeName reg="Appomattox Courthouse">Appomattox Courthouse</placeName>, and that the only possible interest which could attach to an apple tree was that while <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04532" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:19"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was waiting for his messenger to come back from <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04533" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and designate the place of their interview, the old hero rested under the shade in an orchard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6096"/>We had these facts not only from members of his staff, but <hi rend="italics">from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0269.0093.00430.04534" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:19"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> himself</hi>, who once gave a party of us in <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> a detailed account of the surrender.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>It is perfectly true that Federal soldiers cut to pieces the so-called <q direct="unspecified">historic apple tree,</q> dug up its roots, and even cut up and carried off all of the other apple trees in the orchard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>It is also true that <q direct="unspecified">hungry Rebs.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/>But heavy rainfalls during the night of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> and the early part of the next day, the narrowness of the roads running through a densely wooded country, the rawness of the troops and the inexperience of their officers, including some of superior rank, were the causes of much delay, and the <rs>Confederates</rs> had reached a position to attack only on the morning of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> instead of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, as originally intended.

The transportation wagons, containing <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> uncooked, reserved rations, for all the troops, were miles away in the rear, not having been able, on account of the heavy roads, to keep up with the march, and the march itself had been conducted with such open imprudence, in violation of the strictest orders given to the contrary, that it was impossible to entertain any longer the hope that the enemy would be surprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>Wherefore <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0269.0095.00434.04569" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, who had planned and organized the offensive movement, proposed that it be converted into a reconnoisance in force, with the purpose of drawing the enemy nearer to our base at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6132"/>Our army had been put in motion for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6142"/>At the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's battle, as demonstrated by <persName n="Roman,Colonel,,,," id="n0269.0095.00435.04581" reg="nearbymention:Roman,Alfred,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Roman</surname></persName>, the starving and weary Confederates had, during the long and exhaustive conflict, been thrown into much confusion, resulting partly from their pillage of the enemy's camps to satisfy their hunger and recuperate their overtaxed strength, when they believed themselves to be victorious, and partly from the disjointed condition in which the different corps found themselves on the approach of night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6143"/>A further struggle would have been usless, if prosecuted under existing disadvantages, and it looked as if imperatively necessary to cease it, and to reorganize for the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6305"/>There is occasionally some pardonable vivacity of personal feelings, but always expressed in proper and dignified language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6306"/>He has done full justice to his subject, which is no small achievement, for it is seldom that as much can be said of most writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6307"/>If his impartiality is questioned by some, we believe that his evident intention to be just will be acknowledged by all. His assertions and appreciations are based on documents which he puts on record as judicial evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6335"/>It is a grand sight to see masses of troops with glittering sabres or bayonets, and banners and guidons streaming; but the cracking, screaming and bursting of shells from the enemy's guns, over the heads of cavalry, and occasionally dropping in their midst, is never agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6518"/>In obedience to orders from Department Headquarters, I respectfully report that a plan of an attack upon the enemy was settled upon on <dateStruct value="1864-06-23"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="23">23d</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, to take place on the following morning; which plan is fully known to the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6519"/>On the night of the <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num> <persName n="Hagood,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00462.04902" reg="nearbymention:Hagood,Johnson,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName> was made sufficiently familiar with the mode of attack to make the necessary arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6520"/>No other officer of my command was aware of the intended advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6521"/>This precaution was taken fearing that by some means the enemy might learn our intentions and prepare for us. In accordance with the plan my arrangements were made, which are fully and properly given in the enclosed report of <persName n="Hagood,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00462.04903" reg="nearbymention:Hagood,Johnson,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6523"/>As was directed, the artillery from the batteries on the north side of the river opened fire upon the entrenchments of the enemy as soon as the morning's mist had cleared away, and continued its fire with great accuracy, but no execution, for half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6524"/>After the lapse of <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> the fire of these guns was directed upon the batteries of the enemy, drawing, in a great degree, their fire from the advancing infantry, which, as far as I could see, was the only service rendered by our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6525"/>Indeed, I fear we were injured more than we gained by the use of our guns, as it notified the enemy of our intended attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6526"/>My intention was to attack immediately after our guns opened upon the enemy's batteries, but as <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04907" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> had not reported I delayed, and immediately <num value="1">one</num> of his staff officers appeared, by whom <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04908" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was informed that in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> the advance would certainly take place, which would give him time to reach the entrenchments then occupied by <persName n="Hagood,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04909" reg="nearbymention:Hagood,Johnson,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6527"/>At the appointed time the advance was ordered, and immediately the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6528"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line gallantly entered the entrenchments of the enemy and did their duty nobly, and, as was witnessed by <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04910" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> himself, succeeded not only in breaking the enemy, but drove them from their works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6529"/>It was never expected that the entrenchments of the enemy could be held by these <num value="2">two</num> lines of skirmishers, but that they should occupy them until the line of battle could reach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6530"/>As was before stated, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of skirmishers followed immediately the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but was not allowed to go beyond the line of rifle-pits, as it was discovered that the supporting line of battle had not appeared, and had they gone on would have shared the fate of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6531"/>I then asked <persName n="Field,Major-General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04911" reg="mostcommon:Field,C.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName>, who was upon the ground, to order <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04912" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> forward, as a moment's delay would be fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6532"/>He immediately sent the order, which had been previously sent, to <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04913" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> to go forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6533"/>(It is proper here for me to state that this was my <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> effort to get <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04914" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> forward after my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notice to him that <q direct="unspecified">in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> I would certainly move forward.</q>)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6534"/>Some time after <persName n="Field,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04915" reg="mostcommon:Field,C.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> order was sent to <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04916" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> he received a note from him stating that the entrenchments were still occupied by <persName n="Hagood,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04917" reg="nearbymention:Hagood,Johnson,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName>'s troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6535"/>In this he was greatly mistaken, as will be seen by <persName n="Hagood,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04918" reg="nearbymention:Hagood,Johnson,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hagood</surname></persName>'s report, and if necessary to prove this mistake, I can produce a statement from <persName n="Dubose,Colonel,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04919" reg="mostcommon:Dubose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Dubose</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Benning,,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04920" reg="mostcommon:Benning,H.,L.,,:1"><surname>Benning</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> (who by this time had moved up in line of battle on the right of <persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00463.04921" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s position, <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> and after reaching the trenches moved by the left flank down them and occupied the position which <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0269.0099.00464.04922" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,R.,H.,,:8"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was to have taken, and then in his front), that there were no troops in the trenches apart from some stragglers, of which I am sure no command is free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6536"/>After some time, I suppose an hour, <persName n="Field,Major-General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00464.04923" reg="mostcommon:Field,C.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName> put <num value="2">two</num> brigades in the trenches on the left of the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 6" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> road, with a view to attack, and seemed anxious to do so, but I advised against it, as the enemy had had ample time to make all preparations for us, and which they had done, I felt assured he would sustain a very heavy loss and accomplish nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6537"/>At this time orders were received from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00464.04924" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Henry,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> for me to report to him in company with <persName n="Field,Major-General,,,," id="n0269.0099.00464.04925" reg="mostcommon:Field,C.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Field</surname></persName>, who abandoned the attack after hearing the position of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6538"/>My troops were not able to return until night, as they would have been exposed to a heavy fire of the enemy from their entrenchments, which were about <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> in advance of those occupied by our men. A report of the casualties has been forwarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6539"/>I was much troubled at the loss of my men, who did their duty truly and well, without results which to me appeared certain, and surely ought to have been reaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6540"/>It is not my desire to place blame or responsibility upon others (I fear neither) in making the foregoing statements, but merely give facts to the best of my knowledge, after which the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> may draw his own conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6541"/>I have unofficially heard that both I and my command were censured by the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6542"/>My regret is in attempting the attack without full command of all the forces who were to participate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6543"/>Both the plan of battle and of attack were good, but failed in the execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6544"/>The enemy became extremely uneasy along his entire line when the attack was made, and had we been successful at that point our results would have been such as have not heretofore been equalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6545"/>No other portion of my command was engaged except the <num value="3">three</num> regiments of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hagood,,,,," id="n0269.0099.00464.04926" reg="nearbymention:Hagood,Johnson,,,"><surname>Hagood</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> on the left of the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 6" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> road, whose action is given in detail in the enclosed report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6546"/>The plan of battle was such that no part of my command could participate except those mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6786"/>The facts are so plain and decisive against these advocates, that, as is evident, they have labored to evade or suppress them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6787"/>They knew that the phrase, <quote>the people,</quote> so far as political action of the highest nature was concerned, must have meant <hi rend="italics">the people of the then existent political organizations</hi>, and not a mass or nation with unified power and modes of acting, because <hi rend="italics">the same</hi> people that they would fain consider as a nation, was just then, and was always, divided into <hi rend="italics"><num value="13">thirteen</num> most distinct political bodies</hi>, which were acknowledged by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to be respectively sovereign, and were at the moment of final action on the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, described as follows: <quote>Each State retains its sovereignty, freedom and independence.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6790"/>As to the preamble, the generalization: <quote>We, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</quote> was substituted as an equivalent to a specification of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6791"/>This was proper for the reason that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was to take effect when ratified by <num value="9">nine</num> States, and it might result that some would be named, though not in the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6792"/>It should further be explained that the phrase <quote>we, the people,</quote> was used to contradistinguish this pact from the previous <num value="1">one</num>, which had been ratified or acceded to by the <rs>State</rs> governments&mdash;the mere creatures of the people; whereas in this case, it was intended to connect the <rs>Federal Government</rs> directly with and base it upon the very source of power&mdash;the people&mdash;the sovereignty itself, making <hi rend="italics"><num value="13">thirteen</num> sovereignties</hi>, as <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0269.0102.00487.05162" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><surname>Madison</surname></persName> said, and all the fathers understood the constitutors of the new pact&mdash;the constituents or principals of the new agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6793"/>As the <name>States</name> were obliged to act as organizations, and according to the law of their natures, they gave separate assents, and hence the new was not less a compact than the old Constitution, though the powers vested by it in the government created were more extensive [see letter of <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0269.0102.00487.05163" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,W.,P.,,:1"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> to <persName n="Pickering,,,,," id="n0269.0102.00487.05164" reg="mostcommon:Pickering,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickering</surname></persName>, <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct>].

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8071"/>But he coolly writes us that he <q direct="unspecified">only subscribed for <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> year,</q> and having paid for that, he considers himself under no obligation to pay for <dateStruct value="1883--"><year reg="1883">1883</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1884--"><year reg="1884">84</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8072"/>Now, there are several replies to this:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8073"/><num value="1">1</num>. When <num value="1">one</num> is enrolled as a member of the society he is continued until he<hi rend="italics">formally notifies the <rs>Secretary</rs></hi> of his wish to withdraw, and he is bound for his fees (at the rate of <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">$3</measure> per annum) until he gives such notification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8074"/><num value="2">2</num>. The postal laws are plain and emphatic that when a subscriber fails to notify a publisher of his desire to discontinue his paper, and the publisher continues to send it <hi rend="italics">the subscriber is bound to pay the subscription</hi>. And surely it is neither good ethics or good law that <num value="1">one</num> should receive our <hi rend="italics">Papers</hi> for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> or <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> decline to pay for them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8075"/>the terms of membership in our Society are <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">$3</measure> per annum for <hi rend="italics">annual</hi>, and <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> for <hi rend="italics">life</hi> membership, and the payment of these fees entitles the member to <q direct="unspecified">all the privileges of the <name>Society</name>, <hi rend="italics">including the receipt of its official publications</hi>..</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8076"/>For some years&mdash;from <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>&mdash;the <name>Society</name> was unable to make regular publications, and the members paid their fees simply to meet the expenses incident to the prosecution of the work of gathering and preserving <q direct="unspecified">material for the future historian,</q> and <hi rend="italics">received nothing in return</hi>. Since <dateStruct value="1876-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>, however, we have given our members a full <hi rend="italics">quid pro quo</hi> for the fees they have paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8077"/>We have sometimes not been as prompt as is desirable in issuing our numbers, but we have never failed to mail to each member and subscriber <hi rend="italics">every</hi> number to which he was entitled, <pb id="p.575" n="575"/> and when informed that any failed to receive special numbers we have promptly mailed <hi rend="italics">duplicates</hi>. We mention this because we sometimes receive complaints (especially from <num value="1">one</num> in arrears) of failure to receive numbers a year or more ago. A postal card <hi rend="italics">sent at the time of the failure</hi> of the numbers will always receive prompt attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8078"/>But we beg to remind our members that <hi rend="italics">their fees are due and are needed, whether they receive any publi-cations or not</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8079"/>We are not using our <q direct="unspecified">special fund</q> (which is safely invested) for current expenses, and as we must promptly meet these, we need every dollar due us (though if we had to-day the <hi rend="italics">half</hi> of what is due we should be <hi rend="italics">very comfortable</hi>), and we beg our friends to send us their dues at once, without waiting for an agent to call on them, or for any further reminder.</p>

<p>We are indebted to the accomplished author for a copy of this valuable book, which, in paper, type, binding, and <hi rend="italics">general get-up</hi>, are admirable specimens of the book-maker's art, and reflect high credit on all concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8087"/>While with filial hand he draws the portraits and vindicates the fame of his distinguished father and grandfather, he brings out clearly the times in which they lived, pictures the men with whom they came in contact, and describes the great measures of State and Federal policy with which they were connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8101"/>His sense of superiority and fitness to command, being infused at his birth, was never questioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8102"/>From infancy to threescore he knew no physical malady, and the admirable symmetry of his person and the manly beauty of his countenance were the aids to his virtues which secured to him tolerance, affection, and respect from all with whom he mingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8103"/>He passed the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of his cadetship without a single mark of demerit, and during my long acquaintance with him I never heard him accused of an act of meanness, tyranny, or neglect of duty His nature was genial and sociable, and he would join freely in all the sports and amusements proper to his age. He was exempt from every form and degree of snobbery, which is a detestable quality that appears most often among people whose theories of government presume an absolute equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8104"/>He was a favorite with the ladies, but he never allowed them to waste his time, to warp his judgment, or to interrupt his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8105"/>To whatever station he was ordered, however secluded or unhealthy it might be, he would go to it with cheerfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8106"/>Every kind of duty seemed a pleasure to him, and he never intrigued for promotion or reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8108"/>His orders, conveyed in mild language, were instantly obeyed, and his motives were universally approved In all the time in which I observed his conduct I was true to my own antecedents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8109"/>I was a northern man, and no word dropped from my lips or was shed from my pen that did not testify to my origin and proper allegiance.
