<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The author of this volume desires by way of preface to say just <num value="2">two</num> things:--firstly, that it is his earnest hope that this record of a hero may be an aid to brave and true living in the <rs>Republic</rs>, so that the problems knocking at its door for solution may find the heads, the hands, and the hearts equal to the performance of the duties imposed by them upon the men and women of this generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He wooed and won her, and on his <num value="30" type="ordinal">thirtieth</num> birthday she became his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The bride herself was but <num value="23">twenty-three</num>, a woman of resources and of presence of mind, as she needed to be in that primitive settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Children and cares came apace to the young wife, and we may be sure confined her more and more closely to her house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But in the midst of a fast-increasing family and of <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> multiplying cares a day's outing did occasionally come to the busy housewife, when she would go down the river to spend it at her father's farm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Once, <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> after her marriage, she had a narrow escape on <num value="1">one</num> of those rare days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>She had started in a boat with her youngest child, <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName>, and a lad who worked in her household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was spring and the <rs>St. John</rs> was not yet clear of ice.i Higher up the river the ice broke that morning and came floating down with the current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The boat in which <persName n="Garrison,,Mary,,," id="n0165.0003.00012.00010" reg="default:Garrison,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> and her baby rode was overtaken by the fragments and wrecked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The mother with her child sought refuge on a piece of ice and was driven shoreward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Wrapping <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName> in all the clothes she could spare she threw him ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>She and the lad followed by the aid of an overhanging willow bough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The baby was unharmed, for she had thrown him into a snow-bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But the perils of the river gave place to the perils of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In them <persName n="Garrison,,Mary,,," id="n0165.0003.00012.00011" reg="default:Garrison,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> wandered with her infant, who was no less a personage than the father of <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0165.0003.00012.00012" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, until at length she found the hut of a friendly <name>Indian</name>, who took her in and <quote>entertained her with his best words and deeds, and the next morning conducted her safely to her father's.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <rs>Palmers</rs> were a hardy, liberty-loving race of farmers, and <persName n="Garrison,,Joseph,,," id="n0165.0003.00012.00013" reg="default:Garrison,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> was a man of unusual force and independence of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The life which these early settlers lived was a life lived partly on the land and partly on the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They were equally at home with scythe or oar. Amid such terraqueous conditions it was natural enough that the children should develop a passion for the <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> sea. Like ducks many of them took to the water and became sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName> was a sailor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The amphibious habits of boyhood gave to his manhood a restless, roving character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Like the element which he loved he was in constant motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was a man of gifts both of mind and body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>There was besides a strain of romance and adventure in his blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>By nature and his seafaring life he probably craved strong excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This craving was in part appeased no doubt by travel and drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He took to the sea and he took to the cup. But he was more than a creature of appetites, he was a man of sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Being a man of sentiment what should he do but fall in love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The woman who inspired his love was no ordinary woman, but a genuine Acadian beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>She was a splendid specimen of womankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Tall she was, graceful and admirably proportioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Never before had <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName> in all his wanderings seen a creature of such charms of person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Her face matched the attractions of her form and her mind matched the beauty of her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>She possessed a nature almost Puritanic in its abhorrence of sin, and in the strength of its moral convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>She feared to do wrong more than she feared any man. With this supremacy of the moral sense there went along singular firmness of purpose and independence of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>When a mere slip of a girl she was called upon to choose between regard for her religious convictions and regard for her family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It happened in this wise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><persName n="Lloyd,,Fanny,,," id="n0165.0003.00013.00014" reg="default:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>'s parents were Episcopalians, who were inclined to view with contempt fellow-Christians of the <rs>Baptist</rs> persuasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>To have a child of theirs identify herself with this despised <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> sect was <num value="1">one</num> of those crosses which they could not and would not bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But <persName><foreName>Fanny</foreName></persName> had in a fit of girlish frolic entered <num value="1">one</num> of the meetings of these low-caste Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>What she heard changed the current of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>She knew thenceforth that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was no respecter of persons, and that the crucified <rs>Nazarene</rs> looked not upon the splendor of ceremonies but upon the thoughts of the heart of His disciples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Here in a barn, amid vulgar folk, and uncouth, dim surroundings, He had appeared, He, her <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and Master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He had touched her with that white unspeakable appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The laughter died upon the fair girlish face and prayer issued from the beautiful lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>If vulgar folk, the despised Baptists, were good enough for the <name>Christ</name>, were they not good enough for her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Among them she had felt His consecrating touch and among them she determined to devote herself to Him. Her parents commanded and threatened but <persName n="Lloyd,,Fanny,,," id="n0165.0003.00014.00015" reg="default:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> was bent on obeying the heavenly voice of duty rather than father and mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They had threatened that if she allowed herself to be baptised they would turn her out of doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00014.00016" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName> was baptised and her parents made good the threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Their home was no longer her home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>She had the courage of her convictionability to suffer for a belief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Such was the woman who subsequently became the wife of <persName n="Garrison,,Abijah,,," id="n0165.0003.00014.00017" reg="default:Garrison,Abijah,,,"><foreName>Abijah</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, and the mother of <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest moral heroes of the century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName> followed the sea, and she for several years with an increasing family followed <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> from <num value="1">one</num> place and then another she glided after him in her early married life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He loved her and his little ones but the love of travel and change was strong within <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> him. He was ever restless and changeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>During <num value="1">one</num> of his roving fits he emigrated with his family from <placeName reg="Nova Scotia" key="tgn,7013046">Nova Scotia</placeName> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It was in the spring of <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct> that he and they landed in <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The following <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> his wife presented him with a boy, whom they called <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0165.0003.00015.00018" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> afterward <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName> deserted his wife and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Of the causes which led to this act nothing is now known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Soon after his arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName> he had found employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>He made several voyages as sailing-master in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">8</year></dateStruct> from that port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He was apparently during these years successful after the manner of his craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But he was not a man to remain long in <num value="1">one</num> place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>What was the immediate occasion of his strange behavior we can only conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Possibly an increasing love for liquor had led to domestic differences, which his pleasure-loving nature would not brook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Certain it was that he was not like his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He was not a man in whom the moral sense was uppermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He was governed by impulse and she by fixed moral and religious principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He drank and she abhorred the habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>She tried <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moral suasion to induce him to abandon the habit, and once, in a moment of wifely and motherly indignation, she broke up <num value="1">one</num> of his drinking parties in her house by trying the efficacy of a little physical suasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>She turned the company out of doors and smashed the bottles of liquor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This was not the kind of woman whom <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName> cared to live with as a wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He was not the sort of man whom the most romantic love could attach to the apron-strings of any woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>And in the matter of his cup he probably <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> saw that this was what he would be obliged to do as the condition of domestic peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The condition he rejected and, rejecting it, rejected and cast-off his wife and family and the legal and moral responsibilities of husband and father.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Bitter days now followed and <persName n="Garrison,,Fanny,,," id="n0165.0003.00016.00019" reg="default:Garrison,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> became acquainted with grief and want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>She had the mouths of <num value="3">three</num> children to fill &mdash; the youngest an infant at her breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The battle of this brokenhearted woman for their daily bread was as heroic as it was pathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>She still lived in the little house on <address><street n="School street">School street</street></address> where <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00016.00020" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The owner, <persName n="Farnham,,Martha,,," id="n0165.0003.00016.00021" reg="default:Farnham,Martha,,,"><foreName>Martha</foreName> <surname>Farnham</surname></persName>, proved herself a friend indeed to the poor harassed soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Now she kept the wolf from the door by going out as a monthly nurse-<quote><persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Farnham</foreName></persName></quote> looking after the little ones in her absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>She was put to all her possibles during those anxious years of struggle and want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Even <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00016.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>, wee bit of a boy, was pressed into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>She would make molasses candies and send him upon the streets to sell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But with all her industry and resource what could she do with <num value="3">three</num> children weighing her down in the fierce struggle for existence, rendered tenfold fiercer after the industrial crisis preceding and following the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Then it was that she was forced to supplement her scant earnings with refuse food from the table of <quote>a certain mansion on State street.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It was <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00016.00023" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> who went for this food, and it was he who had to run the gauntlet of mischievous and inquisitive children whom he met and who longed for a peep into his tin pail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>But the future apostle of non-resistance was intensely resistant, we may be sure, on such occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/><pb id="p.17" n="17"/> For, as his children have said in the story of his life: <quote><persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00017.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> was a thorough boy, fond of games and of all boyish sport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Barefooted, he trundled his hoop all over <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName>; he swam in the <rs>Merrimac</rs> in summer, and skated on it in winter; he was good at sculling a boat; he played at bat and ball and snowball, and sometimes led the <quote>Southend boys</quote> against the <name>Northenders</name> in the numerous conflicts between the youngsters of the <num value="2">two</num> sections; he was expert with marbles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Once, with a playmate, he swam across the river to <quote> <placeName reg="Great Rock, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2362898">Great Rock</placeName>,</quote> a distance of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of a mile and effected his return against the tide; and once, in winter, he nearly lost his life by breaking through the ice on the river and reached the shore only after a desperate struggle, the ice yielding as often as he attempted to climb upon its surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>It was favorite pastime of the boys of that day to swim from <num value="1">one</num> wharf to another adjacent, where vessels from the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName> discharged their freight of molasses, and there to indulge in stolen sweetness, extracted by a smooth stick inserted through the bung-hole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>When detected and chased, they would plunge into the water and escape to the wharf on which they had left their clothes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Such was the little man with a boy's irrepressible passion for frolic and fun. His passion for music was hardly less pronounced, and this he inherited from his mother, and exercised to his heart's content in the choir of the <orgName n="Baptist Church" type="church">Baptist Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>These were the bright lines and spots in his strenuous young life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He played and sang the gathering brood of cares out of his own and his mother's heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He needed to play and he needed to sing to charm away from his spirit <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> the vulture of poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>That evil bird hovered ever over his childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>It was able to do many hard things to him, break up his home, sunder him from his mother, force him at a tender age to earn his bread, still there was another bird in the boy's heart, which sang out of it the shadow and into it the sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Whatever was his lot there sang the bird within .his breast, and there shone the sun over his head and into his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The boy had unconsciously drawn around him a circle of sunbeams, and how could the vulture of poverty strike him with its wings or stab him with its beak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>She had no choice, poor soul, for unless she toiled they would starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>They were good to the little fellow, but they, too, were poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The <rs>Deacon</rs>, among other things, sawed wood for a living, and <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00018.00029" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> hardly turned <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure>, followed him in his peregrinations from house to house doing with his tiny hands what he could to help the kind old man.

And so, in her weakness, and with a great fear in her heart for her babies, when she. was gone from them into the dark unknown forever, she bethought her of making them as fast as possible selfsupporting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>And what better way was there than to have the boys learn some trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>James she had already apprenticed to learn the mystery of shoemaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>And for <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00019.00031" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> she now sent and apprenticed him, too, to the same trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Oh! but it was hard for the little man, the heavy lapstone and all this thumping and pounding to make a shoe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Oh! how the stiff waxen threads cut into his soft fingers, how all his body ached with the constrained position and the rough work of shoemaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>But <num value="1">one</num> day the little <num value="9">nine</num>-year-old, who was <quote>not much bigger than a last,</quote> was able to produce a real shoe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Then it was probably that a dawning consciousness of power awoke within the child's mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>He himself by patience and industry had created a something where before was nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The eye of the boy got for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time a glimpse of the man, who was still afar off, shadowy in the dim approaches of the hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>But the work proved altogether beyond the strength of the boy. The shoemaker's bench was not his place, and the making of shoes for his kind was not the mission for which he was sent into the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>And now again poverty, the great sceneshifter, steps upon the stage, and <persName n="Lloyd,,Fanny,,," id="n0165.0003.00019.00032" reg="default:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> and her <num value="2">two</num> boys are in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> on that never-ending quest for bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>She had gone to work in a shoe factory established by an enterprising <name>Yankee</name> in that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The work lasted but a few months, when the proprietor failed and the factory was closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>In a <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> strange city mother and children were left without employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>In her anxiety and distress a new trouble, the greatest and most poignant since <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName>'s desertion, wrung her with a supreme grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/><persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName>, the light and pride of her life, had run away from his master and gone to sea. <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00020.00033" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>, poor little homesick <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00020.00034" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>, was the only consolation left the broken heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>And he did not want to live in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and longed to return to <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>So, mindful of her child's happiness, and all unmindful of her own, she sent him from her to <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName>, which he loved inexpressibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He was now in his <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Very happy he was to see once more the streets and landmarks of the old town &mdash; the river, and the old house where he was born, and the church next door and the school-house across the way and the dear friends whom he loved and who loved him. He went again to live with the <name>Bartletts</name>, doing with his might all that he could to earn his daily bread, and to repay the kindness of the qear old deacon and his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It was at this time that he received his last scrap of schooling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He was, as we have seen, but <num value="11">eleven</num>, but precious little of that brief and tender time had he been able to spend in a school-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>He had gone to the <orgName n="Primary School" type="school">primary school</orgName>, where, as his children tell us, he did not show himself <quote>an apt scholar, being slow in mastering the alphabet, and surpassed even by his little <persName><roleName n="Sister">sister</roleName> <foreName>Elizabeth</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>During his stay with <persName n="Bartlett,Deacon,,,," id="n0165.0003.00020.00035" reg="nearbymention:Bartlett,Ezekiel,,,"><roleName n="Deacon">Deacon</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, he was sent <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> to the grammar-school, and now on his return to this good friend, a few more weeks were added to his scant school term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>They proved the last of his school-days, and the boy went forth <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> from the little brick building on the <name>Mall</name> to finish his education in the great workaday world, under those stern old masters, poverty and experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>By and by <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00021.00036" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> was a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time apprenticed to learn a trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It was to a cabinetmaker in <placeName reg="Haverhill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049885">Haverhill, Mass.</placeName> He made good progress in the craft, but his young heart still turned to <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName> and yearned for the friends left there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>He bore up against the homesickness as best he could, and when he could bear it no longer, resolved to run away from the making of toy bureaus, to be once more with the <name>Bartletts</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>He had partly executed this resolution, being several miles on the road to his old home, when his master, the cabinetmaker, caught up to him and returned him to <placeName reg="Haverhill, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049885">Haverhill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>But when he heard the little fellow's story of homesickness and yearning for loved places and faces, he was not angry with him, but did presently release him from his apprenticeship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>And so the boy to his great joy found himself again in <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName> and with the good old wood-sawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Poverty and experience were teaching the child what he never could have learned in a grammar-school, a certain acquaintance with himself and the world around him. There was growing within his breast a selfcare and a self-reliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It was the autumn of <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, when, so to speak, the boy's primary education in the school of experience terminated, and he entered on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stage of his training under the same rough tutelage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>At the age of <num value="13">thirteen</num> he entered the office of the <orgName n="Newburyport Herald" type="newspaper">Newburyport <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> to learn to set types.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>At last his boy's hands had found work which his boy's heart did joy to have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>He soon mastered the compositor's art, became a remarkably rapid <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> composer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>As he set up the thoughts of others, he was not slow in discovering thoughts of his own demanding utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The printer's apprentice felt the stirrings of a new life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>A passion for selfimprovement took possession of him. He began to read the <rs>English</rs> classics, study American history, follow the currents of party politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>No longer could it be said of him that he was not an apt pupil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>He was indeed singularly apt. His intelligence quickened marvelously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The maturing process was sudden and swift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Almost before <num value="1">one</num> knows it the boy in years has become a man in judgment and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>This precipitate development of the intellectual life in him, produced naturally enough an appreciable enlargement of the <hi rend="italics">ego</hi>. The young eagle had abruptly awakened to the knowledge that he possessed wings; and wings were for use &mdash; to soar with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Ambition, the desire to mount aloft, touched and fired the boy's mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>As he read, studied, and observed, while his hands were busy with his work, there was a constant fluttering going on in the eyrie of his thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>By an instinct analogous to that which sends a duck to the water, the boy took to the discussion of public questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>It was as if an innate force was directing him toward his mission &mdash; the reformation of great public wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>At <num value="16">sixteen</num> he made his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> contribution to the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>It was a discussion of a quasi-social subject, the relation of the sexes in society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>He was at the impressionable age, when the rosy <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of love is at his tricks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>He was also at a stage of development, when boys are least attractive, when they are disagreeably virile, full of their own importance and the superiority of their sex. <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> In the <quote>Breach of the marriage promise,</quote> by <quote>An old bachelor,</quote> these signs of adolescence are by no means wanting, they are, on the contrary, distinctly present and palpable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>But there were other signs besides these, signs that the youth had had his eyes wide open to certain difficulties which beset the matrimonial state and to the conventional steps which lead to it, and that he had thought quite soberly, if not altogether wisely upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The writer was verdant, to be sure, and self-conscious, and partial in his view of the relations of the sexes, but there was withal a serious purpose in the writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>He meant to expose and correct what he conceived to be reprehensible conduct on the part of the gentler sex; bad feminine manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Just now he sees the man's side of the shield, a few years later he will see the woman's side also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>He ungallantly concludes <quote>to lead the <hi rend="italics"><q direct="unspecified">single life,</q> </hi> and not,</quote> as he puts it, <quote>trouble myself about the ladies.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>A most sapient conclusion, considering that this veteran misogynist was but <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> old. During the year following the publication of this article, he plied his pen with no little industry-producing in all <num value="15">fifteen</num> articles on a variety of topics, such as <quote>South American affairs,</quote> <quote>State politics,</quote> <quote>A glance at <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>,</quote> etc., all of which are interesting now chiefly as showing the range of his growing intelligence, and as the earliest steps by which he acquired his later mastery of the pen and powerful style of composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>In a letter addressed to his mother about this time, the boy is full of <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00023.00037" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>, undisguisedly proud of <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00023.00038" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>, believes in <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00023.00039" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Indeed it is altogether a matter of surprise that I have met with such signal success, seeing I do not understand <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num> single rule of grammar</hi>, and having a very inferior education.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The printer's lad was plainly not lacking in the bump of approbativeness, or the quality of self-assertiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The quick mother instinct of <persName n="Garrison,,Fanny,,," id="n0165.0003.00024.00040" reg="default:Garrison,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> took alarm at the tone of her boy's letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Possibly there was something in <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00024.00041" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>'s florid sentences, in his facility of expression, which reminded her of <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>He, too, poor fellow, had had gifts in the use of the pen, and what had he done, what had he come to?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Had he not forsaken wife and children by <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> forsaking the path of holiness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>So she pricks the boy's bubble, and points him to the <num value="1">one</num> thing needful-<name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>But in her closing words she betrays what we all along suspected, her own secret pleasure in her son's success, when she asks, <quote>Will you be so kind as to bring on your pieces that you have written for me to see?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Ah! was she not every inch a mother, and how <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00024.00042" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> did love her. But she was no longer what she had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>And no wonder, for few women have been called to endure such heavy burdens, fight so hopelessly the battle for bread, all the while her heart was breaking with grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Disease had made terrible inroads upon her once strong and beautiful person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Not the shadow of the strength and beauty of her young womanhood remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>She was far away from her early home and friends, far away from her darling boy, in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/><persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName>, <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> her pride, was at sea, <persName n="Elizabeth,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00025.00043" reg="mostcommon:Elizabeth,nomatch:0"><surname>Elizabeth</surname></persName>, a sweet little maiden of <num value="12">twelve</num>, had left her to take that last voyage beyond another sea, and <persName><foreName>Abijah</foreName></persName>, without <num value="1">one</num> word of farewell, with the silence of long years unbroken, he, too, also!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>had hoisted sail and was gone forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>And now in her loneliness and sorrow, knowing that she, too, must shortly follow, a great yearning rose up in her poor wounded heart to see once more her child, the comfort and stay of her bitter life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>And as she had written to him her wish and longing, the boy went to her, saw the striking change, saw that the broken spirit of the saintly woman was day by day nearing the margin of the dark hereafter, into whose healing waters it would bathe and be whole again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The unspeakable experience of mother and son, during this last meeting is not for you and me, reader, to look into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Soon after <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00025.00044" reg="nearbymention:Lloyd,Fanny,,,"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>'s return to <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 82" reg="newburyport, essex county, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName> a cancerous tumor developed on her shoulder, from the effects of which she died <dateStruct value="1823-09-03"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="3">3</day>, <year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>, at the age of <num value="45">forty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>More than a decade after her death her son wrote: <quote>She has been dead almost <measure n="11years" type="date">eleven years</measure>; but my grief at her loss is as fresh and poignant now as it was at that period;</quote> and he breaks out in praise of her personal charms in the following original lines: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The influence of this superb woman was a lasting power for truth and righteousness in the son's stormy life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>For a whole year after her death, the grief of the printer's lad over his loss, seemed to have checked the activity of his pen. For during that period nothing of his appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi>. But after the sharp edge of his sorrow had worn off, his pen became active again in the discussion of public men and public questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It was a period of bitter personal and political feuds and animosities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The ancient <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName> was <hi rend="italics">in articulo mortis</hi>. The death-bed of a great political organization proves oftentimes the graveyard of lifelong friendships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>For it is a scene of crimination and recrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>And so it happened that the partisans of <persName n="Adams,,John,,," id="n0165.0003.00026.00045" reg="default:Adams,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, and the partisans of <persName n="Adams,,John,,," id="n0165.0003.00026.00046" reg="default:Adams,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>'s old <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, <persName n="Pickering,,Timothy,,," id="n0165.0003.00026.00047" reg="default:Pickering,Timothy,,,"><foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Pickering</surname></persName>, were in <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct> doing a thriving business in this particular line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Into this funereal performance our printer's apprentice entered with pick and spade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He had thus early <hi rend="italics">apenchant</hi> for controversy, a soldier's scent for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>If there was any fighting going on he proceeded directly to have a hand in it. And it cannot be denied that that hand was beginning to deal some manly and sturdy blows, whose resound was heard quite distinctly beyond the limits of his birthplace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>His communications appeared now, not only in the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi>, but in the <orgName n="Salem Gazette" type="newspaper">Salem <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi></orgName> as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Now it was the <name>AdamsPickering</name> controversy, now the discussion of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0165.0003.00026.00048" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Francis,,,:10"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> as a presidential candidate, now the state of the country in respect of parties, now the merits of <quote>American writers,</quote> which afforded his &apos;prentice hand the requisite practice in the use of the pen. He <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> had already acquired a perfect knowledge of typesetting and the mechanical makeup of a newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>During his apprenticeship he took his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson in the art of thinking on his feet in the presence of an audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The audience to be sure were the members of a debating club, which he had organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>He was very ambitious and was doubtless looking forward to a political career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He saw the value of extempore speech to the man with a future, and he wisely determined to possess himself of its advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>He little dreamt, however, to what great use he was to devote it in later years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>There were other points worth noting at this time, and which seemed to prophecy for him a future of distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>He possessed a most attractive personality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>His energy and geniality, his keen sense of humor, his social and bouyant disposition, even his positive and opinionated temper, were sources of popular strength to him. People were strongly drawn to him. His friends were devoted to him. He had that quality, which we vaguely term magnetic, the quality of attaching others to us, and maintaining over them the ascendency of our character and ideas.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>In the midst of all this progress along so many lines, the days of his apprenticeship in the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> office came to an end. He was just <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>With true <name>Yankee</name> enterprise and pluck, he proceeded to do for himself what for <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> he had helped to do for another-publish a newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>And with a brave heart the boy makes his launch on the uncertain sea of local journalism and becomes editor and publisher of a real, wide-awake sheet, which he calls the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Free Press" type="newspaper">Free Press</orgName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Honest and fair discussion it will court; and its columns will be open to all temperate and intelligent communications emanating from whatever political s:r;rce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The publisher cannot condescend to solicit their support.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>This was admirable enough in its way, but it was poor journalism some will say. And without doubt when judged by the common commercial standard it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> poor journalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>In this view it is a remarkable production, but in another aspect it is still more remarkable in that it took with absolute accuracy the measure of the man. As a mental likeness it is simply perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>At no time during his later life did the picture cease to be an exact moral representation of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It seems quite <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> unnecessary, therefore, to record that he proceeded immediately to demonstrate that it was no high sounding and insincere declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>For in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> number, he mentions with that singular serenity, which ever distinguished him on such occasions, the discontinuance of the paper on account of matter contained in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> issue, by <num value="10">ten</num> indignant subscribers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Here was plainly a wholly new species of the <hi rend="italics">genus homo</hi> in the editorial seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>What, expect to make a newspaper pay and not beg for patronage?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Why the very idea was enough to make newspaperdom go to pieces with laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Begging for patronage, howling for subscribers, cringing, crawling, changing color like the chameleon, howling for Barabbas or bellowing against <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, all these things must your newspaper do to prosper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>On them verily hang the whole law and all the profits of modern journalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>This is what the devil of competition was doing in that world when <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0165.0003.00029.00051" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> entered it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>And he would not. He went on editing and publishing his paper for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> regardful only of what his reason approved-regardless always of the disapproval of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Not once did he palter with his convictions or juggle with his self-respect for the <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> sake of pelf or applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>His human horizon was contracted, to be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It could hardly be otherwise in <num value="1">one</num> so young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>His world was his country, and patriotism imposed limits upon his affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/><quote><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName>, our whole country, and nothing but our country,</quote> was the ardent motto of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Free Press" type="newspaper">Free Press</orgName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Besides this contraction of the affections, there was also manifest in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> journalistic venture a deficiency in the organ of vision, a failure to see into things and their relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>What he saw he reported faithfully, suppressing nothing, adding nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But the objects which passed across the disk of his editoral intelligence were confined almost entirely to the surface of things, to the superficies of national life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He had not the ken at <num value="20">twenty</num> to penetrate beneath the happenings of current politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Of the existence of slavery as a supreme reality, we do not think that he then had the faintest suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>No shadow of its tremendous influence as a political power seemed to have arrested for a brief instant his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>He could copy into his paper this atrocious sentiment which <persName n="Everett,,Edward,,," id="n0165.0003.00030.00052" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName> delivered in Congress, without the slightest comment or allusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/><pb id="p.31" n="31"/> The reason is plain enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Slavery was a <hi rend="italics">terra incognito</hi> to him then, a book of which he had not learned the A B C. <persName n="Everett,Mister,,,," id="n0165.0003.00031.00053" reg="nearbymention:Everett,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>'s language made no impression on him, because he had not the key to interpret its significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>What he saw, that he set down for his readers, without fear or favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>He had not seen slavery, knew nothing of the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Acquaintance with the deeper things of life, individual or national, comes only with increasing years, they are hardly for him who has not yet reached his majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Slavery was the very deepest thing in the life of the nation <measure n="64years" type="date">sixty-four years</measure> ago. And if <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00031.00054" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> did not then so understand it, neither did his contemporaries, the wisest and greatest of them so understand it. The subject of all others which attracted his attention, and kept his editorial pen busy, was the claim of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> for indemnity from the general government, for certain disbursements made by her for the defence of her sea-coast during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>This matter, which forms but a mere dust point in the perspective of history, his ardent young mind mistook for a principal object, erected into a permanent question in the politics of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>But the expenditure of enormous energies upon things of secondary and of even tertiary importance, to the neglect of others of prime and lasting interest, is supremely human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>He was errant where all men go astray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But the schoolmaster of the nation was abroad, and was training this young man for the work he was born to do. These <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> were, therefore, not wasted, for in the university of experience he did ever prove himself an apt scholar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/><num value="1">One</num> lesson he had learned, which he never needed to <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> relearn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Just what that lesson was, he tells in his valedictory to the subscribers of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Free Press" type="newspaper">Free Press</orgName></hi>, as follows: <quote>This is a time-serving age; and he who attempts to walk uprightly or speak honestly, cannot rationally calculate upon speedy wealth or preferment.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>A sad lesson, to be sure, for <num value="1">one</num> so young to learn so thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Perhaps some reader will say that this was cynical, the result of disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>But it was not cynical, neither was it the result of disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It was unvarnished truth, and more's the pity, but truth it was none the less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of those hard facts, which he of all men, needed to know at the threshold of his experience with the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Such a revelation proves disastrous to the many who go down to do business in that world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Ordinary and weak and neutral moral constitutions are wrecked on this reef set in the human sea. Like a true mariner he had written it boldly on his chart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>There at such and such a point in the voyage for the golden fleece, were the rocks and the souldevouring dragons of the way. Therefore, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>my soul, beware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>What, indeed, would this argonaut of the press take in exchange for his soul?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Certainly not speedy wealth nor preferment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Ah! he could not praise where he ought to reprobate; could not reprobate where praise should be the meed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>He had no money and little learning, but he had a conscience and he knew that he must be true to that conscience, come to him either weal or woe. Want renders most men vulnerable, but to it, he appeared, at this early age, absolutely invulnerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Should he and that almost omnipotent inquisitor, public opinion, ever in the future come into collision upon any principle <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> of action, a keen student of human nature might forsee that the young recusant could never be starved into silence or conformity to popular standards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>All the discoveries of the young journalist were not of this grim character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>He made another discovery altogether different, a real gem of its kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The dragnet of a newspaper catches all sorts of poets and poetry, good, bad, and indifferent-oftener the bad and indifferent, rarely the good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The drag-net of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Free Press" type="newspaper">Free Press</orgName></hi> was no exception to this rule; but, <num value="1">one</num> day, it fetched up from the depths of the hard commonplaces of our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> town life a genuine pearl.

<p> Going up-stairs to my office, <num value="1">one</num> day, I observed a letter lying near the door, to my address; which, on opening, I found to contain an original piece of poetry for my paper, the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Free Press" type="newspaper">Free Press</orgName></hi>. The ink was very pale, the handwriting very small; and, having at that time a horror of newspaper original poetry-which has rather increased than diminished with the lapse of time-my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulse was to tear it in pieces, without reading it; the chances of rejection, after its perusal, being as <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; . . . but summoning resolution to read it, I was equally surprised and gratified to find it above mediocrity, and so gave it a place in my journal. . . . As I was anxious to find out the writer, my post-rider, <num value="1">one</num> day, divulged the secret, stating that he had dropped the letter in the manner described, and that it was written by a <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> lad, named <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0165.0003.00034.00057" reg="nearbymention:Whittier,John,Greenleaf,,"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName>, who was daily at work on the shoemaker's bench, with hammer and lapstone, at East Haverhill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Jumping into a vehicle, I lost no time in driving to see the youthful rustic bard, who came into the room with shrinking diffidence, almost unable to speak, and blushing like a maiden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>With the instinct of the bright <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> boy, he determined to seek his fortunes in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>If his honesty and independence put him at a disadvantage, as publisher and editor, in the struggle for existence, he had still his trade as a compositor to fall back upon <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> As a journeyman printer he would earn his bread, and preserve the integrity of an upright spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>And so without a murmur, and with cheerfulness and persistency, he hunted for weeks on the streets of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> for a chance to set types.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>This hunting for a job in a strange city was discouraging enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>But the slight knowledge which he was able to obtain of the town and its inhabitants under these circumstances did not now help him, when from office to office he went in quest of something to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Business was dull, which kept our journeyman printer on the wing; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at <num value="1">one</num> and then at another printing office we find him setting types for a living during the year <dateStruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>And the arrangement pleased the young radical, for it enabled him to free his soul of the necessity which was then sitting heavily upon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>He does not hate intemperance and warless, but slavery more, and those, therefore, he formally relegates thenceforth to a place of secondary importance in the endeavors of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>It is obvious that the colonization scheme has no strong hold upon his intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>He had already arrived at conclusions in respect of the rights of the colored people <quote>to choose their own dwelling place,</quote> and against the iniquity of their expatriation, which cut directly at the roots of the colonization scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>The <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName> had given it out that there was no little desire on the part of many masters to set their slaves free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>No master was moved to take advantage of the opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>This was discouraging to the believers in the efficacy of colonization as a potent anti-slavery instrument.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>He obtained at this period an intimate personal knowledge of the free colored people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>He saw that they were not essentially unlike other races-that there was nothing morally or intellectually peculiar about them, and that the evil or the good which they manifested was the common property of mankind in similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Vile and malignant indeed is this practice, and culpable are they who follow it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>This idea of the natural equality of the races he presented in the <hi rend="italics">Genius</hi> a few weeks before with Darwinian breadth in the following admirable sentences: <quote>I deny the postulate that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has made, by an irreversible decree, or any inherent qualities, <num value="1">one</num> portion of the human race superior to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>No matter how many breeds are amalgamated-no matter how many shades of color intervene between tribes or nations give them the same chances to improve, and a fair start at the same time, and the result will be equally brilliant, equally productive, equally grand.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>As he stood he was much above the medium height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>His dark hair had already partially left the crown of the high dome-shaped head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>There was through the whole physical man a nice blending of strength and delicacy of structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>The impression of fineness and finish was perhaps mainly owing to the woman-like purity and freshness of skin and color, which overspread the virile lines and features of the face from brow to chin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>This characterization of the reformer's countenance may be considered absurd by some readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>The even gentleness of his rich voice, his unfailing courtesy and good temper, his quick eye for harmless pleasantries, his hearty laugh, the <name>Quakerlike</name> calmness, deliberateness, and meekness, with which he would meet objections and argue the righteousness of his cause, his sweet reasonableness and companionableness were in strange contrast to popular misconceptions and caricatures of him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>Here in the germ was the <rs>Southern</rs> idea, slave labor, slave institutions; and here also was the <rs>Northern</rs> idea, free labor, free institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Once planted they grew, each seed idea multiplying after its kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>In course of time there arose on <num value="1">one</num> side an industrial system in which the plantation principle, race-rule and race-slavery, were organic centers; and, on the other, a social system in which the principle of popular power and government, the town meeting, and the common school were the ganglia of social expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>Contrary ideas beget naturally enough contrary interests and institutions.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>On political as well as on moral grounds they desired emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>But there was a difficulty which at the time proved insuperable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>The nation-making principle, the idea of country, was just emerging out of the nebulous civil conditions and relations of the ante-Revolutionary epoch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>There was no existent central authority to reach the evil within the <name>States</name> except the local governments of the <name>States</name> respectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>And States in revolt against the central authority of the mother country would hardly be disposed to divest themselves of any part of their newly asserted right to govern themselves for the purpose of conferring the same upon any other political body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>To each State, then, the question was necessarily left for settlement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>The war, during its continuance, absorbed the united resources and energies of the people and their leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>The anti-slavery movement made accordingly but small progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>The instinct of self-preservation was altogether too masterful for the moral starveling.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The effects, so electrical and impressive, which followed the reading of the declaration were not disproportioned to its merits, for it was an instrument of singular power, wisdom, and eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Indeed, to this day, more than half a century after it was written it still has virtue to quicken the breath and stir the pulses of a sympathetic reader out of their normal time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>A great passion for freedom and righteousness irradiates like a central light the whole memorable document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>It begins by a happy reference to an earlier convention, held some <measure n="57years" type="date">fifty-seven years</measure> before in the same place, and which adopted a <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> declaration holding <quote>that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;</quote> and how at the trumpet-call of its authors <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of people rushed to arms <quote>deeming it more glorious to die instantly as free men, than desirable to live <num value="1">one</num> hour as slaves</quote> ; and how, though few in number and poor in resources those same people were rendered invincible by the conviction that truth, justice, and right were on their side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>But the freedom won by the men of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> was incomplete without the freedom for which the men of <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct> were striving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>The authors of the new declaration would not be inferior to the authors of the old <quote>in purity of motive, in earnestness of zeal, in decision of purpose, intrepidity of action, in steadfastness of faith, in sincerity of spirit.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>Unlike the older actors, the younger had eschewed the sword, the spilling of human blood in defence of their principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Theirs was a moral warfare, the grappling of truth with error, of the power of love with the inhumanities of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>Then it glances at the wrongs which the fathers suffered, and at the enormities which the slaves were enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>The <quote>fathers were never slaves, never bought and sold like cattle, never shut out from the light of knowledge and religion, never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters,</quote> but all these woes and more, an unimaginable mountain of agony and misery, was the appalling lot of the slaves in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>The guilt of this nation, which partners such a crime against human nature, <quote>is unequaled by any other on earth,</quote> and therefore it is bound to instant repentance, <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> and to the immediate restitution of justice to the oppressed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>The Declaration of Sentiments denies the right of man to hold property in a brother man, affirms the identity in principle between the <name>African</name> slave trade and American slavery, the imprescriptibility of the rights of the slaves to liberty, the nullity of all laws which run counter to human rights, and the grand doctrine of civil and political equality in the <rs>Republic</rs>, regardless of race and complexional differences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>It boldly rejects the principle of compensated emancipation, because it involves a surrender of the position that man cannot hold property in man; because slavery is a crime, and the master is not wronged by emancipation but the slaves righted, restored to themselves; because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not real, property, the labor of the slaves would still remain to the masters and doubled by the new motives which freedom infuses into the breasts of her children ; and, finally because, if compensation is to be given at all it ought to be given to those who have been plundered of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>It spurns in <num value="1">one</num> compact paragraph the pretensions of the colonization humbug as <quote>delusive, cruel, and dangerous.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>But lofty and uncompromising as were the moral principles and positions of the declaration, it nevertheless recognized with perspicuity of vision the <name>Constitutional</name> limitations of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in relation to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>It frankly conceded that Congress had no right to meddle with the evil in any of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>But wherever the national jurisdiction reached the general government was bound <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> to interfere and suppress the traffic in human flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>It was the duty of Congress, inasmuch as it possessed the power, to abolish slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, the <rs type="place">National Territories</rs>, along the coast and between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>The free States are the <hi rend="italics">particeps criminis</hi> of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>They are living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force to rivet the manacles of chattel slavery upon <num value="1000000">millions</num> in the <rs>South</rs>; they are liable at any instant to be called on under the <rs>Constitution</rs> to suppress a general insurrection of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>This relationship is criminal, <quote>is full of danger, <emph>it must be broken up</emph>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>So much for the views and principles of the declaration, now for the designs and measures as enumerated therein: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/>Now the foreign emissary was particularly exasperating to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> sensibility on the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2189"/>He was the veritable red rag to the pro-slavery bull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2190"/>The public announcement, therefore, that he was to speak in the city threw the public mind into violent agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>The <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi> augmented the excitement by the recklessness with which they denounced the proposed meeting, the former promising to <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n0165.0013.00217.00640" reg="nearbymention:Thompson,George,,,"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName> a lynching, while the latter endeavored to involve his associates who were to the <quote>manner born</quote> in the popular outbreak, which was confidently predicted in case the <quote>foreign vagrant</quote> wagged his tongue at the time appointed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>Notwithstanding the rage of press and people the meeting was postponed through no willingness on the part of the ladies, but because of the panic of the owners of the hall lest their property should be damaged or destroyed in case of a riot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>The power of benignity over malignity lasted a few moments after this little speech, when the situation changed rapidly from bad to worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>They seemed not to dare to enter, notwithstanding their fury,, but mounted on each other's shoulders, so that a row of hostile heads appeared over the slight partition, <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> of half the height of the wall which divides the society's rooms from the landing place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>We requested them to allow the door to be shut; but they could not decide as to whether the request should be granted, and the door was opened and shut with violence, till it hung useless from its hinges.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>It is a wonderful scene, a marvelous example of <name>Christian</name> heroism, for in the midst of the hisses and threats and curses of the rioters, the prayer of the brave woman rose clear and untremulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>But now the rioters have thrown themselves against the partition between the landing-place and the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>But he does not become excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>Now the voice of the mayor was heard urging the ladies to go home as it was dangerous to remain; and now the voice of <persName n="Chapman,,Maria,Weston,," id="n0165.0013.00223.00668" reg="default:Chapman,Maria,Weston,,"><foreName>Maria</foreName> <foreName>Weston</foreName> <surname>Chapman</surname></persName>, replying: <quote>If this is the last bulwark of freedom, we may as well die here as anywhere.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>The ladies finally decided to retire, and their exit diverted, while the operation lasted, the attention of the huge, cat-like creature from their object in the anti-slavery office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>This time it was the anti-slavery sign which hung from the rooms of the society over the sidewalk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>The mob had caught sight of it, and directly set up a yell for it. The sensation of utter helplessness in the presence of the multitude seemed at this juncture to return to the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">chief magistrate</rs> of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>It was impossible to control the cataractlike passions of the rioters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>He heard their awful roar for the sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>The din had risen to terrific proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>The thought of what might happen next appalled him. The mob might begin to bombard the sign with brickbats, and from the sign pass to the building, and from the building to the constables, and then-but the mayor glanced not beyond, for he had determined to appease the fury of the mob by throwing down to it the hateful sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>A constable detached it, and hurled it down to the rioters in the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>But by the act the mayor had signified that the rule of law had collapsed, and the rule of the mob had really begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>When the rioters had wreaked their wrath upon the emblem of freedom, they were in the mood for more violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The appetite for destruction, it was seen, had not been glutted; only whetted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/><persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0165.0013.00224.00671" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,Helen,Eliza,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s situation was now extremely critical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>He could no longer remain where he was, for the mob would invade the building and hunt him like hounds from cellar to garret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>He must leave the building without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>To escape from the front was out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>A way of escape must, therefore, be found in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>All of these considerations the mayor and <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0165.0013.00224.00672" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,Helen,Eliza,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s friends urged upon him. The good man fell in with this counsel, <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> and, with a faithful friend, proceeded to the rear of the building, where from a window he dropped to a shed, but in doing so was very nearly precipitated to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>After picking himself up he passed into a carpenter's shop, meaning to let himself down into <placeName reg="Wilson's Lane">Wilson's Lane</placeName>, now <address><street n="Devonshire street">Devonshire street</street></address>, but the myriad-eyed mob, which was searching every portion of the building for their game, espied him at this point, and with that set up a great shout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>The workmen came to the aid of the fugitive by closing the door of the carpenter's shop in the face of his pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>The situation seemed desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>Retreat from the front was cut off; escape from the rear anticipated and foiled.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>Subsequently he began to see things in a different light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>As the area of his experience extended it came to him that living was more than believing, that it was not every <num value="1">one</num> who professed faith in <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> had love for him in the heart; and that there were many whom his own illiberalism had rated as depraved and wicked on mere points of doctrine, who, nevertheless, shamed by the blamelessness and nobility of their conduct multitudes of ardent Christians of the lip-service sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>Indeed this contradiction between creed and conduct struck him with considerable force in the midst of his harsh judgments against unbelief and unbelievers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/><pb id="p.267" n="267"/></p> 
<p>As the months of his earnest young life passed him by, they showed him as they went how horrible a thing was faith without works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/><quote>By their fruits ye shall know them,</quote> the <rs>Master</rs> had said, and more and more as he saw how many and great were the social evils to be reformed, and in what dire need stood his country of righteous action, did he come to put increasing emphasis on conduct, as the <num value="1">one</num> thing needful to rid the land of the triple curse of slavery, intemperance, and war. As he mused upon these giant evils, and the desolation which they were singly and together causing in the world, and upon the universal apathy of the churches in respect of them, it seemed to him that the current religion was an offence and an abomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>And in his prophetic rage he denounced it as <quote>a religion which quadrates with the natural depravity of the heart, giving license to sin, restraining no lust, mortifying not the body, engendering selfishness, and cruelty!-a religion which walks in silver slippers, on a carpeted floor, having thrown off the burden of the cross and changed the garments of humiliation for the splendid vestments of pride!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>a religion which has no courage, no faithfulness, no self-denial, deeming it better to give heed unto men than unto <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>When, after his discharge from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> jail, he was engaged in delivering his message on the subject of slavery, and was seeking an opportunity to make <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> what he knew known to the people of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, he was forced, after vainly advertising for a hall or meetinghouse in which to give his <num value="3">three</num> lectures, to accept the offer of <persName n="Kneeland,,Abner,,," id="n0165.0016.00268.00814" reg="default:Kneeland,Abner,,,"><foreName>Abner</foreName> <surname>Kneeland</surname></persName>'s Society of Infidels of the use of their hall for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>But, grateful as he was for the hospitality of the infidels, he, nevertheless, rather bluntly informed them that he had no sympathy with their religious notions, and that he looked for the abolition of slavery to evangelicism, and to it alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>A few years in the university of experience, where he learned that conduct is better than creeds, and living more than believing, served to emancipate him from illiberal prejudices and narrow sectarianism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>Another circumstance which induced to this kind of reflection was the case of <persName n="Latimer,,George,,," id="n0165.0018.00312.00988" reg="default:Latimer,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Latimer</surname></persName>, who was seized as a fugitive slave in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>They had rejected his way, which was the only true way, and were, therefore, anathema maranatha.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>When a moral idea which has been the subject of widespread agitation, and has thereby gained a numerous following, reaches out, as reach out it must, sooner or later, for incorporation into law, it will, in a republic like ours, do so naturally and necessarily through political action-along the lines of an organized party movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>The Liberty party formation was the product of this strong tendency in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>Premature it possibly was, but none the less perfectly natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>Now every <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, that is worthy of the name, is a compound rather than a simple fact, consisteth of a bundle of ideas rather than a single idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>There must be a platform built of many planks to support the number of votes requisite to victory at the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>There will always be <num value="1">one</num> idea or interest of the many ideas or interests, that will dominate the organization, be erected into a paramount issue upon which the party throws itself upon the country, but the secondary ideas or interests must be there all the same to give strength and support to the main idea and interest.

<p>Besides this peculiarity in the composition of the great political parties in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, there is another not less distinct and marked, and that is the <name>Constitutional</name> limitations of the <rs>Federal</rs> political power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>Every party which looks for ultimate success at the polls must observe strictly these limitations in its aims and issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>Accordingly when the moral movement against slavery sought a political expression of the idea of Abolition it was constrained within the metes and bounds set up by the <rs>National Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>Slavery within the <name>States</name> lay outside of the political boundaries of the general Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>Slavery within the <name>States</name>, therefore, the more sagacious of the <rs>Liberty</rs> party leaders placed not among its bundle of ideas, into its platform of national issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>These leaders were confident that the existence of slavery depended upon its connection with the <rs>National Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>Their aim was to destroy the evil by cutting this connection through which it drew its blood and nerve supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>We cherish feelings of profound contempt for the quibbling spirit of criticism which is endeavoring to explain away the meaning of language, the design of which as a matter of practice, and the adoption of which as a matter of bargain, were intelligently and clearly understood by the contracting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>Their new interpretations of the <rs>Constitution</rs> are a bold rejection of the facts of history, and a gross insult to the intelligence of the age, and certainly never can be carried into effect without dissolving the <rs>Union</rs> by provoking a civil war.</quote>

<p>you must know that to the microscopic eyes of its friends, as well as to the telescopic eyes of its enemies, <hi rend="italics">the <rs>Liberator</rs> has faults;</hi> these they keep to themselves as much as they honestly may, but they are not the less sensible of them, and are all the more desirous to see them immediately abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>Luckily, they are not faults of principleneither moral nor intellectual deficiencies-but faults the cure of which rests solely with yourself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>I hardly know how to tell you what the faults are that we find with it, lest you should think them none at all, or else unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>But no matter, of that you must be the judge; we only ask you to listen to our opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>We think the paper often bears the mark of haste and carelessness in its getting up; <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> that the matter seems to be hastily selected and put in <hi rend="italics">higgledy-piggledy</hi>, without any very apparent reason why it should be in at all, or why it should be in the place where it is. I suppose this is often caused by your selecting articles with a view to connect remarks of your own with them, which afterward in your haste you omit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>Then we complain that each paper is not so nearly a complete work in itself as it might be made, but that things are often left at loose ends, and important matters broken off in the middle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>I assure you, that <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Harriman</foreName></persName> is not the only <num value="1">one</num> of the friends of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> who grieves over your more <quote>anon</quote> and <quote>more next week</quote> --which <quote>anon </quote> and <quote> next week </quote> never arrive ...</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>Then we complain that your editorials are too often wanting, or else such, from apparent haste, as those who love your fame cannot wish to see; that important topics, which you feel to be such, are too often either entirely passed over or very cursorily treated, and important moments like the present neglected. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>We have our suspicions, too, that good friends have been disaffected by the neglect of their communications; but of this we can only speak by conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>In short, it appears to those who are your warmest friends and the stanchest supporters of the paper, that you might make the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> a more powerful and useful instrumentality than it is, powerful and useful as it is, by additional exertions on your part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>It is very unpleasant to hear invidious comparisons drawn between the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Emancipator</hi> with regard to the manner of getting it up, and to have not to deny but to excuse them-ani we <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> knowing all the time that you have all the tact and technical talent for getting up a good newspaper that <persName n="Leavitt,,,,," id="n0165.0019.00329.01044" reg="nearbymention:Leavitt,Joshua,,,"><surname>Leavitt</surname></persName> has, with as much more, intellectual ability as you have more moral honesty, and only wanting some of his (pardon me) industry, application, and method.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>He might have pleaded also the dissipation of too much of his energies in consequence of more or less pecuniary embarrassments from which he was never wholly freed; but, above all, he might have pleaded his increasing activity as an anti-slavery lecturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>His contributions to the movement against slavery were of a notable character in this direction, both in respect of quantity and quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>Poor indeed he was, much beyond the common allotment of men of his intelligence and abilities, but he was never too indigent to answer the appeals of poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>If the asker's needs were greater than his own he divided with him the little which he had.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>But as there was still considerable service to be got out of the old pair, he, like a prudent man, laid aside the new ones for future use.
