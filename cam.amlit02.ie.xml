<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The life of a village community is not seldom enriched by the inclusion of a rebel, an original who refuses obstinately to conform to type, and succeeds in following out his idea, in contrast to the humdrum routine of his fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>When the community happens to be <placeName reg="Concord, Merrimack, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013647">Concord</placeName>, the picturesque and historic village where the <name>Revolution</name> began, the <name>Weimar</name> of American literature, and when the rebel happens to be an American faun, the conjunction must result in no ordinary enrichment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The French-looking surname came by way of the <rs type="place">Channel</rs> Islands, for the author's grandfather was born in <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey</placeName>, and, in spite of his <name>British</name> origin, had served as a sailor in a Continental privateer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It was a rigid and limited life made up of work, thrift, duty, and meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Reflection might suggest, however, that the portrait he restored bears an unlucky resemblance in its sombreness and its unloveliness to the portrait of <persName n="Randolph,,Edward,,," id="n0199.0001.00016.00155" reg="default:Randolph,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName> in the <title>Twice told tales</title>, and a little further thought would perhaps convince us that <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00016.00156" reg="nearbymention:Hawthorne,John,,,"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> usually treats <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>, not as the central theme in his canvas, but as a dark background for the ideas and for the experiences which more deeply concern him. Those ideas and experiences have little to do with <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> except by contrast; they were partly furnished to his imagination by the enthusiastic but uncritical thinkers among his acquaintance who kindled rapturously at <persName n="Alcott,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00016.00157" reg="mostcommon:Alcott,Louisa,M.,,:2"><surname>Alcott</surname></persName>'s conversations or basked in the indefiniteness of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00016.00158" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s lectures, and partly they were furnished by his own contact with <persName n="Alcott,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00016.00159" reg="mostcommon:Alcott,Louisa,M.,,:2"><surname>Alcott</surname></persName> and <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00016.00160" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> and with their writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Like them, he was less a Puritan than a lover of the present, and if he seemed often to deal with things long past, it was only because he had the faculty, more than other men, of recognizing in the present whatever had served its purpose or was worn out or dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>But if as a Transcendentalist he stood aloof from <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>, his temperament forced him to stand aloof also from the other <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> Transcendentalists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Although their philosophy, as they liked to say, was a <q direct="unspecified">questioning</q> of life, he differed from them all in being a true skeptic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>To be quite precise, let us say that he drew the inspiration of his romances not so much from their ideas as from the neglected but inevitable conclusions of their ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/><persName n="Alcott,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00017.00161" reg="mostcommon:Alcott,Louisa,M.,,:2"><surname>Alcott</surname></persName> and <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00017.00162" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,R.,W.,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> uttered between them a set of doctrines so full of apparent contradictions as to seem almost double-faced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They preached the sacredness of fact as against the authority of tradition; they made much of physical heredity, of evolution, of fate; they pointed out the inadequacy of any moral scheme to comprehend all the surprises of nature; yet being inveterate optimists, both of them, and both at certain moments curiously mystical, and both enjoying an outward orthodoxy of manners and culture, they soothed their hearers and seemed less dangerous than they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Their sincerity, of course, was unquestionable, but they obscured even to themselves the startling conclusions of their own surmises, and having shaken their moral world to its foundation, they allowed the structure to settle again, and all this in such a glamour of temperamental cheerfulness that those who felt only the eloquence of their mood could depart conscious of spiritual uplift, and none but the few who attended to the implications of their specific ideas went away troubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>How few these critics were is attested by the lonely position in which their spokesman, <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00017.00163" reg="nearbymention:Hawthorne,John,,,"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>, seems to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He was no mystic; what attracted him in Transcendentalism was its free inquiry, its radicalism, its contact with actual life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>In his stories, therefore, he was a philosophical experimenter, in whose method was no room for optimism nor for prepossessions of any kind; he had recourse to life in order to try out the efficacy or the consequences of Transcendental ideas, and if the result was hardly what he expected, he still pursued the hypothesis to the bitter end. He was really the questioner, the detached observer, that other Transcendentalists thought they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The term needs defining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>To him, as to other Transcendentalists, the fortune of a human soul was the most critical of experiences, comparatively negligible were the doings of society as a whole or the outward panorama of events and scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>If to be thus interested in the soul is to be a psychologist, then <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00018.00174" reg="nearbymention:Hawthorne,John,,,"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num>, as to some extent are all who write of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is important to realize how broad and general his ideas and his art were, how completely he avoided the special and the minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>He studied no subtle character, nor any character subtly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>He was a moralist rather than a psychologist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Were it not sufficiently evident in the stories themselves, the notes preserved in his journals would show that his imagination was engaged <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by a moral idea, which he afterwards incorporated in plot and in persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>When he is most successful the plot seems actually to occur, and the persons really live; when his imagination fails him, the incidents seem allegorical and the figures become shadowy; but in either case the abstract idea from which he started is likely to be clear enough, and his own personality will probably be felt as standing outside the story, looking on. Since he is neither novelist nor preacher, but only an investigator of moral ideas, it is equally beside the mark to expect of him <persName n="Balzac,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00018.00178" reg="mostcommon:Balzac,nomatch:0"><surname>Balzac</surname></persName>'s sense of the social panorama, or <persName n="Bunyan,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00018.00179" reg="mostcommon:Bunyan,John,,,:1"><surname>Bunyan</surname></persName>'s certitude of faith.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>A writer who pictures life chiefly in order to project abstract <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> ideas is not likely to reveal in his art more of himself than his general disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Most philosophers can be classed roughly among those who conceive of the ideal ends of life as already existing in heaven, in some order or pattern which may be imitated on earth, or among those who think of the ideal as of something which does not yet exist, but which is implicit in the universe, and toward which the universe evolves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>A philosopher of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or Platonic type, if he notices facts at all, is likely to be disconcerted by them, since they rarely conform to his ideal or serve to authorize it; his comfort is in rising superior to actual life&mdash;that is, in ignoring it. <persName n="Alcott,,,,," id="n0199.0001.00021.00211" reg="mostcommon:Alcott,Louisa,M.,,:2"><surname>Alcott</surname></persName> was an almost pure example of this type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Concerned primarily with the actual world before him, he found a natural use for the past in the explanation it might give of the present, but the present was to him just as naturally the more important moment, and most interesting of all was the occasional hint or prophecy of that to which time through its past and present changes might be tending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>He was a radical, therefore, but he saw clearly that this particular present will soon be no more sacred than any other moment of the past, and that to devote oneself to any cause as though it were a final remedy of circumstances, promising rest thereafter, is merely to postpone stagnation for a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>With this insight he could not readily give his faith to any reform or reformer; even the crusade for abolition and the war for the <rs>Union</rs> left him cold, for he wisely doubted whether measures conceived in the root-and-branch spirit might not raise more evils in the state than they were intended to cure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>True reform, the only kind that could enlist his sympathy, must work hand in hand with nature's slowly evolving but inevitable order, and so long as that order can be but partially or infrequently discerned, it is best to do nothing violent, nothing headlong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The fact is of some consequence in understanding his genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>When the <rs>American</rs> and <rs>European</rs> notebooks were finally included in the complete editions of his writings, they took their place, not as an appendix or illustration of more perfect things, but on equal terms with his other works; for the journal manner was suited to his realistic, unprejudiced search into the world about him, and his lifelong preoccupation with his diary was not, as with most novelists, for the sake of books to be written later, but was itself the satisfaction of a primary literary interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Like the journals, the essay sketches take the scene as they find it, extract from it all that observation can, and then discard it, having proved no point and exhibited no characters in continuous interplay, but having uncovered possibilities, hints, causes, coincidences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The ideal of self-reliance was that a man should live according to his own nature, by listening to the dictates of the over-soul as revealed in his impulses; to this end he should keep himself free of the imprisoning past, and of conventional society, which embodies the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Since nature is unfolding a necessary order in and around us, an order which we apprehend with difficulty, the great danger of asserting ourselves is that we may thereby place ourselves outside of our true development, and never return to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The doctrine of compensation, in <num value="1">one</num> form or another, was peculiarly dear to Transcendental optimism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Every action carries its reward or punishment with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>His observations brought him into a certain agreement with the doctrine; because a natural order <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> constantly unfolds in the world, he believed in the efficacy of mere time to break down conventions and to reveal a nobler law, and in his historical <hi rend="italics">scenes&mdash;Howe's Masquerade</hi>, for example, or <title>The Gray Champion</title>&mdash;he liked to show a fossilized past at the moment when it is shattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>As he was more mature, his genius was better prepared to receive a definitive bent, and his experiences determined that that bent should take an emotional rather than an emphatically intellectual direction.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Long before that poet had reached the zenith of his reputation the professor had grown weary of his chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he worked hard enough to justify weariness, particularly at the uncongenial task of supervising the instruction in the elementary language courses given by his assistants; but gradually, whatever enthusiasm he may have had for a scholarly, academic career wore itself out, and toward the end of his <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of service&mdash;he resigned in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>&mdash;he was almost querulous in <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> his attitude toward a calling without the aid of which he would probably have remained a somewhat local and minor writer, his disposition scarcely prompting him to draw inspiration from Transcendentalism or the anti-slavery movement, and his genius not qualifying him to probe the heart or to wander in shadowland.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>Whatever its irksomeness, however, his position at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> brought with it compensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Some of his critics have wished that it might have been otherwise, apparently supposing that, if he had been more unfortunate, his poetry would have been more to their liking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>It is not, however, on record that any critic has deliberately wooed infelicity in order to qualify himself for a fuller enjoyment of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0199.0002.00036.00323" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s placid verses.</p>

The prior volume with such pieces as <title>The village Blacksmith</title>, <title><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> acre</title>, <title>Maidenhood</title>, and the egregiously anabatic <title>Excelsior</title>, strengthened his hold upon the popular heart, and in the successful ballads proper, such as <title>The Wreck of the <rs>Hesperus</rs></title> and <title>The skeleton in Armor</title>, it gave him, in addition, some incentive to address his readers in narrative verse, the form of poetry in which, during his middle period, <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> he made himself easily the chief American master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Neither in these earlier volumes, to which may be added <title>The Belfry of <placeName key="tgn,7007867" n="1.000 1" reg="brugge,west-vlaanderen,vlaanderen,belgie,europe">Bruges</placeName> and other poems</title> (<dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>), nor in <title>Evangeline</title> (<dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>) and succeeding tales in verse, did <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0199.0002.00037.00324" reg="nearbymention:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> show himself to be a consummate metrical and verbal artist of the highest order or a poet of sustained imaginative flight; nor was he, in compensation, <num value="1">one</num> of those writers who produce a strong effect through their subtle knowledge of human character or their exceptional ability to describe and interpret nature or their profound understanding of a country or a period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Yet even in these particulars he was capable of exhibiting distinguished merit&mdash;witness his command of the simpler rhythms, his wide reaching metrical experimentation, his feeling for the sea, his sympathetic attitude toward the <rs>Middle Ages</rs> displayed in <title>The golden legend</title> (<dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>), his presentation of the larger natural features of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> in <title>Evangeline</title>&mdash;and in his lyrical appeal, especially through his semi-didactic poems of reflection and sentiment, as well as in his general narrative power, he was during his life, and he still remains, unapproached by any other American poet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The years immediately preceding his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> marriage in <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct> were partly devoted to the composition of a poetical drama in <num value="3">three</num> acts, <title>The Spanish student</title>, which was published serially in <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>, and the next year was issued in book form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Whatever he accomplished beyond this as teacher and editor and writer of prose, and as self-conscious poet seeking success in the more elaborate traditional forms of his art, is worthy, to say the least, of as much praise as the similar work of his predecessors, contemporaries, and successors among American poets, and is not clearly doomed to a speedier death than the elaborate productions of his contemporaries and successors among the <rs>British</rs> poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>His place is not with the few eminent poets of the world, or even of his century, as the admiration of the mass of his countrymen and the critical lucubrations of some of them might be held to imply; but it is, legitimately and permanently, in the forefront of the small band of important writers in verse and in prose who during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> century of the republic's existence laid firmly and upon more or less democratic lines the foundations of a native literature. </p></div2>

<p><persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0199.0004.00065.00559" reg="nearbymention:Poe,Edgar,Allan,,"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>'s critical doctrines find their best exemplification in his own poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>He is, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, a poet of beauty, paying little heed to morality or to the life of his fellow-men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>He is, in the second place, a master-craftsman, who has produced a dozen poems of a melody incomparable so far as the western world is concerned; and he has achieved an all but flawless construction of the whole in such poems as <title>The Raven</title>, <title>The haunted Palace</title>, and <title>The Conqueror Worm</title>; while in <title>The bells</title> he has performed a feat in onomatopoeia quite unapproached before or since in the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>He is, moreover, <num value="1">one</num> of the most original of poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>And the best of his verse exhibits a spontaneity and finish and perfection of phrase, as well as, at times, a vividness of imagery, that it is difficult to match elsewhere in American poetry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>But his poems of extraordinary worth are exceedingly few &mdash;scarcely above a score at most&mdash;in which must be included the earlier lines <title>To Helen</title>, <title>Israfel</title>, <title>The city in the sea, the <name>Sleeper</name></title>, <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> <hi rend="italics">The Haunted Palace, Dream-Land, The Raven, Ulalume, For Annie</hi>, and <title><persName n="Lee,,Annabel,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00560" reg="default:Lee,Annabel,,,"><foreName>Annabel</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>And most of his earlier verses are manifestly imitative, <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00561" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName> and <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00562" reg="mostcommon:Moore,Frank,,,:2"><surname>Moore</surname></persName> and <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00563" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shelley,,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00564" reg="mostcommon:Shelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Shelley</surname></persName> being his chief models; while much of his earlier work, including all of the volume of <dateStruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></dateStruct>, and some of his latest&mdash; notably the verses addressed to <persName n="Osgood,Mrs.,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00565" reg="nearbymention:Osgood,F.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Osgood</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shew,Mrs.,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00566" reg="mostcommon:Shew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Shew</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lewis,Mrs.,,,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00567" reg="mostcommon:Lewis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName>&mdash;are either fragmentary and <q direct="unspecified">incondite</q> or mere <q direct="unspecified">verses,</q> or both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>It has been justly said that <q direct="unspecified">there is almost no poet between whose best and worst verse there is a wider disparity.</q><note anchored="yes">

<p><persName n="Robertson,,J.,M.,," id="n0199.0004.00066.00568" reg="default:Robertson,J.,M.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>, <title>New essays, p</title>. <num value="76">76</num>.</p></note> His range, too, is narrower than that of any other American poet of front rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Consistently with <num value="1">one</num> of his theories already adverted to, he wrote no long poem, save the juvenile <title>Tamerlane</title> and <title>Al Aaraaf</title>, both of them extremely crude performances (though <title>Al Aaraaf</title> contains excellent passages and played a large part in his development as poet), and an abortive play, <title>Politian</title>, which he never saw fit to publish in its entirety; so that he lives as poet solely by reason of his lyrics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>And within the realm of the lyric he confined himself to the narrowest range of ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Nature he employed merely as ornament or as symbol or to fill in the background; and nowhere in his poems does he deal with the life about him, except in so far as he writes of friends and kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>His most constant theme&mdash;if we exclude the poet himself, for few writers have so constantly reflected themselves in their work&mdash;is either the death of a beautiful woman and the grief occasioned thereby, or the realm of shades&mdash;the spirit-world &mdash;a subject to which he was strongly attracted, especially in his middle years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Hence, although most <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> critics have accorded him first place among American poets, most American critics have hesitated to accept their verdict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Much of the excellence of his best poems arises from the never-ending revisions to which he subjected them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/><title>The Raven</title>, for example, exists in upwards of a dozen variant forms, and some of his earlier verses were so radically altered as to be scarcely recognizable in their final recast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>His melody, especially in his later poems, grows in large measure out of his all but unexampled use of parallelism and of the refrain.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>It is idle to complain that his best verses&mdash;as <title>Israfel</title> or <title>The haunted Palace</title> &mdash;are superficial; and it is futile to contend that such poems as <title><persName n="Lee,,Annabel,,," id="n0199.0004.00067.00571" reg="default:Lee,Annabel,,,"><foreName>Annabel</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></title> or the sonnet <title>To My mother</title> are not sincere, or that his poems, <num value="1">one</num> and all, lack spontaneity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>But it is not to be denied that some of his best-known poems&mdash;as <title>Lenore</title> and <title>The Raven</title>&mdash;exhibit too much of artifice; that <title>The Conqueror Worm</title> and passages in still other poems approach too near to the melodramatic; and that, with many readers, his verses must suffer by reason of their sombreness of tone.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Like his poems, his tales are notably unequal.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>By reason of his fondness for the terrible and for the <hi rend="italics">outre</hi>;, he is to be classed with the <name>Gothic</name> romancers: he makes constant use of Gothic machinery, of apparitions, cataleptic attacks, premature burial, and life after death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>In <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, political theory and political philosophy have always been closely associated with practical politics and with the problems of very immediate interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The cogent and effective theory of the <rs>American Revolution</rs> was distinctly part of a determined effort to reach results in civil organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>And so too in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, a period by no means without its contribution to the philosophy of the state, most of the political theory appeared in speeches and pamphlets directed to the accomplishment of a present and very concrete purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The <rs>Americans</rs> have been charged with incapacity for sustained theorizing, or for prolonged logical discussion; and yet <num value="1">one</num> may safely say that no other people of modern times have so widely used political theory or so generally discussed practical affairs on a theoretical basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>The whole nature of our institutions has prompted men to indulge in argument which was legalistic and was often tinctured with philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Even the unlearned could not speak and think of democracy and its hopes without indulging in visions; they could not discuss the presence of slavery without touching the border of the deepest problems of social order; they could not speak of union or states' rights without entering at least the outer portal of philosophic argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>But we need not look for detached theoretical treatises; the statesman, the politician, and the jurist were busily using such learning as they had and such aptitude for theory as they possessed in the concrete and difficult problems which were begotten by democracy in a country which, to use <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s words, was <q direct="unspecified">rapidly&mdash;I was about to say fearfully &mdash;growing.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few decades of the century, if they produced no notable pieces of abstract political theory, gave alluring opportunity for oratory and offered also an unusual field for the jurist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>The orator had big themes&mdash;democracy, slavery, free labour, expansion, states' rights, nationalism, as well as the well-worn subjects of banks and tariffs and lands and commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The jurist was called to the novel task of construing constitutions, of passing on the fundamental law of a federal republic, and more&mdash;the task of developing and adjusting a system of private law suited to the needs of a new people and a new country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>In both of these fields of action and of thought the <rs>Americans</rs> did much; in oratory appeared <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00610" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00611" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00612" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, <persName n="Randolph,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00613" reg="nearbymention:Randolph,John,,,"><surname>Randolph</surname></persName>, <persName n="Choate,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00614" reg="nearbymention:Choate,Rufus,,,"><surname>Choate</surname></persName>, <persName n="Benton,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00615" reg="nearbymention:Benton,Thomas,H.,,"><surname>Benton</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00616" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, and others only less worthy of note; in jurisprudence, <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00617" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName> and <persName n="Kent,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00618" reg="nearbymention:Kent,James,,,"><surname>Kent</surname></persName> and Story and <persName n="Wheaton,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00619" reg="nearbymention:Wheaton,Henry,,,"><surname>Wheaton</surname></persName>, by judicial opinion or by written text, laid the foundations of American public and private law and ably performed a creative task such as rarely, if ever, before fell to the lot of the jurist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Much of the oratory of the time was of a kind which appeals but little to the reader of the present day. The speeches that have come down to us are often diffuse and occasionally florid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Nothing else could be expected from the leaders of a nation which was full of eager life and was assured of its own high destiny, a nation in which a man to be a popular leader must have power in appealing to the multitude, uncritical in its attitude toward literary form, provided the speaker himself have vitality, assurance, and a plentiful store of winged words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>This, it is true, is not altogether just, for <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00620" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s diction was on the whole restrained and strong; <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00621" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> rarely declaimed; <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00622" reg="nearbymention:Clay,Henry,,,"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> and <persName n="Benton,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00623" reg="nearbymention:Benton,Thomas,H.,,"><surname>Benton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00624" reg="nearbymention:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> were always earnest and did not merely toy with words; <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00071.00625" reg="nearbymention:Everett,Edward,,,"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>'s orations, polished and academic, never descended into the lower realms of commonplace word-juggling for applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>And yet it is probably right to say that most of the speaking of the time was affected by the fact that orators were appealing to a wide <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> constituency, to a people engaged in very practical tasks, but self-confident, buoyant, and withal emotional or at least idealistic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>The jurists of the time may here be considered <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, although, as already said, it is not possible to disassociate the greatest among them from the problems which enlisted the enthusiasm and interest of the orator and political leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>If <num value="1">one</num> turns, for example, to the decisions which <persName n="Marshall,,John,,," id="n0199.0005.00072.00626" reg="default:Marshall,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName> (<dateStruct value="1755--"><year reg="1755">1755</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>) gave as chief justice, <num value="1">one</num> at once thinks of the work of <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00072.00627" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> and other great particularists, who in the field of active politics put forth theories totally at variance with those coming from the <rs type="place">Court</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>It is, therefore, quite impossible to detach <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00072.00628" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName> from the most important movements of his time; for his words lose significance unless we see that they marked out lines of social and political progress and profoundly affected the character and career of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>And thus too, if the establishment of a widely accepted system of jurisprudence is necessary for the building up of a common industrial and social life for the nation at large, the work of Joseph Story, <persName n="Kent,,James,,," id="n0199.0005.00072.00629" reg="default:Kent,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Kent</surname></persName>, and others, cannot be assigned to any narrow field of technical jurisprudence of interest to the professional lawyer alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>The appointment of <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00072.00630" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName> to the chief justiceship (<dateStruct value="1801-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1801">1801</year></dateStruct>) was of great significance, for in the course of a few years he showed the importance of the <rs>Federal</rs> judiciary and the great authority of his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>For <measure n="34years" type="date">thirty-four years</measure> he presided over the <rs type="place">Court</rs> and gave out a series of decisions which fixed permanently the principles of constitutional construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>His task was in some respects more that of the statesman than the lawyer; he was called upon to consider public questions of far-reaching importance and to lay down principles which he must gather from the nature of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which was itself, in its composite organization, an experiment, a new form of political order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>He was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> judge in history on whom fell the duty of interpreting and expounding the fundamental basis of the state; for, though the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> had been in existence <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> before <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00072.00631" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName> took his seat on the bench, not much had been done to prepare the way or to throw light on the solution of perplexing <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> problems which <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00073.00632" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName> had to solve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Ordinary legal learning and, above all, learning in the domain of ordinary private law could not avail him much; indeed <num value="1">one</num> may question whether, had his mind been stored with vast legal lore, he could have entered on his work without falling into traps of pedantry or finding himself clogged by precedent and technicality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>He brought to his great undertaking considerable experience in public affairs, an interest and a viewpoint arising from practical participation in government, and no small amount of learning in international and municipal law and in what we should now call political science.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>The layman reading <persName n="Marshall,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00073.00633" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,John,,,"><surname>Marshall</surname></persName>'s decisions will be struck by the fact that he did not balance an opinion on a long line of precedents or seek refuge behind the thoughts and words of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Few references to authority are to be found, and in some of his greatest cases there is not a single citation of precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>He begins with simple statements, founded, <num value="1">one</num> is led to think, in common sense, and then, with a careful but not overwrought analysis, he leads <num value="1">one</num> forward to his conclusions, always with a directness and a simplicity which are characteristic of strong mental grasp but conceal the cleverness with which the road has been chosen or the arguments exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>By his very statement of the issues involved in a case he could quietly disclose to the litigants against whom he was ruling the far-reaching and perhaps destructive consequences of their own contentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>And, as we have said, he did this, as he must needs do it in constitutional decisions, not by an elaborate dissecting of precedent and legal authority, but by a calm outlook upon the field and a searching analysis of the elements involved in the discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>In his most important cases he appears to rise far above the details of the immediate controversy, <num value="1">one</num> might almost say above the merits of the particular case, and to have his eye on the big principles affecting the future growth of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>And thus he created American constitutional law; at least, not to exaggerate, he marked out the broad lines of constitutional construction and fashioned the fundamental principles on which union and government might rest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>But he did even more; he placed the <rs type="place">Court</rs> itself in a position of authority and influence, dignified and made potent the whole Federal judicial system, and thus helped to build up that respect for the <rs>Federal</rs> courts which has been of such tremendous importance in the development of American life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>This in fact was no easy task; the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> itself was often fiercely attacked; it often went counter to the intense prejudice of parties, states, and sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of such volumes in the days when the critical case system was not used by beginners, when texts were comparatively few, and when practising attorneys and judges were not provided with long series of reports, in days also when the layman was interested in problems concerning the nature of the <rs>Union</rs> and the powers of government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The layman commonly thinks of the law as fixed, or as developing only by the addition of statutes passed by some legislative body, but the truth is that law grows, and the common law above all, as questions and problems arise; judges on the bench and writers of text-books who do more than merely chronicle decisions, have great opportunity to direct the law into new channels and to determine the course of its development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>At an early day his father purchased a slave, not a usual possession for an up-country man, and when <persName n="Calhoun,,John,,," id="n0199.0005.00078.00667" reg="default:Calhoun,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> grew to manhood <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> he married a distant cousin of social standing and with some means, and thus the young man was connected with the social aristocracy and the slave-owning interests of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>These simple facts stand out prominently in any effort to understand him in his development, because he became the learned and devoted advocate of the slave interests and defended, with his logic and his power in debate, the economical and social regime of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>In <dateStruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></dateStruct> he entered Congress, and was at once <num value="1">one</num> of the leaders among the new young men, who were out of patience with the dallying methods of the older Jeffersonian politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>For some years he was an ardent nationalist; possibly it is too much to say that he committed himself by votes or speeches to an interpretation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> radically opposed to state sovereignty; but in these earlier days we find in his spirit no traces of sectionalism or of any narrow particularism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>In the latter part of the decade between <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, overcome by the unrest in his state and moved, it would seem, by its economic difficulties, he succumbed to the pressure of his surroundings and became the leader in formulating doctrines which <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> put forth to the world to defend itself against the tariff&mdash;shrewdly reasoned and highly elaborated doctrines of state sovereignty, the basis of nullification and secession.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>Sometimes he was a leader so far in advance that Southern people scarcely knew that they were slowly following his footsteps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>More and more the <rs>South</rs> was identified with slavery; and more and more the people took their cue from <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00079.00669" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>He did not pose as a friend of disruption, and probably was a sincere friend of the <rs>Union</rs>; but the <rs>Union</rs>, he insisted with increasing fervour, must be a Union respecting the rights of the states, a Union which would hold together only if its government respected the varying conditions and the different interests of states and, indeed, of sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>He thus became the chief defender of <num value="2">two</num> things or <num value="2">two</num> ideas, slavery and particularism, to which the developing character of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> century was utterly opposed; slavery here and everywhere was doomed to be beaten down by the tide of humanitarianism, while localism, and sectionalism, and all other tendencies to exclusiveness and segregation, were at variance with those great forces of aggregation and of nation-building which were manifest in the whole civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/><placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s great talents were actually devoted to elaboration and vehement promulgation of theories to the effect that the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> was a clever political system devised for the express purpose of protecting peculiar local interests against external attack; and the chief local interest was the <q direct="unspecified">peculiar institution</q> of the <rs>South</rs>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/><placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s important contributions to the theory of American government began in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct> in connection with the agitation in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> about the tariff question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>From that time on, his attention was largely devoted to inculcating the doctrine that the state had the right under the <rs>Constitution</rs> to protect its local interest against national aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>His task was, and needed to be, in the presence of the growing power of the <rs>North</rs>, to develop principles for the protection of the minority, and in his quest for these doctrines he worked out a notable series of constitutional principles and philosophical theories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Between <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct> he developed his theories in defence of nullification by a single state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>The basis of the right is of course the sovereignty of the state, and <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00080.00670" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> insisted on indivisibility of sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/><q direct="unspecified">I maintain,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">that sovereignty is in its nature indivisible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>It is the supreme power in a state, and we might just as well speak of half a square, or half of a triangle, as half a sovereignty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Probably it is not quite evident that <num value="1">one</num> cannot justly speak of half a square; but without cavilling at his illustration we may see that in these words he swept aside statements which had been common before this time, to the effect that states, coming into the <rs>Union</rs>, surrendered a portion of their sovereignty and retained the remainder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Beneath his whole reasoning, therefore, lay the principles of what we may call organic philosophy, the recognition of the vital character of the body politic, though, of course, in this case, the body politic was the commonwealth, not the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>He also believed that mere agreement could not establish law or political unity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>This notion, at variance <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> with the older <num value="1">one</num> that men by consent could form themselves, artificially as it were, into a new entity, was beginning to take its hold on the philosophic world, and it was <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s appreciation of this notion and his use of it in concrete political controversy which constitutes <num value="1">one</num> of his signal contributions to the history of political theory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>He did not, in these early days, dwell on the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>In fact he did not wish, especially then, to emphasize that right; he relied, rather, on the right of nullification, that is, on the power of any state to declare, not through its legislature but through a convention representing the sovereignty of the state, that a federal law is void and must not be enforced within the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Nullification, in fact, was put forth as a device whereby the state might be preserved, with its authority untouched, without having to resort to secession from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>It was, therefore, as he conceived it, conservative in a twofold sense: it conserved the right of the individual state, and it saved the <rs>Union</rs>; for, without nullification, secession was the only remedy for wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>To preserve the appearance of constitutional method, he insisted that when a law was nullified the judgment of all the states should be sought, and they, by a <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> vote, might declare that the disputed power belonged to the national government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>It is quite unnecessary to assert that <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00081.00671" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> was insincere in announcing this method of passing on controverted points; the protection of the minority and the real desirability of maintaining the <rs>Union</rs> were cogent in his mind; the <rs>Union</rs> was too much of a reality for him to think easily of its being altogether at the beck and nod of a single state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>It is plain, however, that <num value="1">one</num> more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the states could, by his plan, pronounce a measure void; and, moreover, if <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> declared it constitutional, such declaration could not deter a state, all-powerful in its sovereignty, from seceding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>A resort to nullification was, in <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s mind, a means of determining whether the states supported the government, which was only their agent, and, if they did support it, then and only then might secession be resorted to. Secession, in other words, though theoretically within the competence of any state, would not as a rule be justified simply because of the action of the central government, for the government was the agent <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> of the states; until the principals acted, the individual state should content itself with nullification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>At the very outset, as we have seen, <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00082.00672" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> announced principles calculated to defend the minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>His later and more elaborate treatises, notably his <title>Disquisition on government</title> and his <title>Discourse on the <rs>Constitution</rs> and government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></title>, pushed to the end his theories as to the constitutional guarantees of minority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>Here we find a very able discussion of constitutional principles so cogently expressed that they challenge <num value="1">one</num>'s admiration if they do not carry conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Intent upon disproving the notion that a mere majority of individuals, mere numbers, can decide upon rights or impose decisions on others, he insists that each interest or portion of the community must have a negative, and thus only when there is concurrence of the elements can there be the right to exercise power; where this principle of negation and concurrence does not exist, government rests on force; where they do exist, there is constitutionalism; a majority may be tyrannical, and therefore an unrestrained majority is inconsistent with constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>It would be hard to deny that our constitutional system rests in part on the belief that majorities have not all power over the individual; but <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s theory was different from this: interests, individual communities, must have, through the negative, the power of self-defence&mdash;and this meant, in reality, the <rs>South</rs> as a section and slavery as an interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Through his whole career from <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct> till his death in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> there appears consistently this right of a minority to protect itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/><num value="1">One</num> other word must be said of <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s work; for he did much more than outline the principles of state sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>In the thirties, when the <rs>South</rs> began to defend slavery as never before, <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0199.0005.00082.00673" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> stepped forward as a leader; and henceforward he was prepared to defend slavery as an institution and to use his theories concerning the <rs>Union</rs> to safeguard the institution at every turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Here was the unnatural union: constitutional theory skilfully adapted to warding off intrusion was wedded to an economic, social, and moral condition of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>This union was all the more significant because slavery, though defended by theories of localism, was in need of recognition and of protection by national law; it needed in <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> fact to expand, if it were to hold its own; and thus <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s doctrine of the individual rights of the individual states must so be turned, by infinitely cautious curves of logic, as to justify the protection of slaves on the high seas, the existence of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, national guardianship of slavery in the national domain, the denunciation of free speech on the subject at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>No <num value="1">one</num> save a giant among clever logicians and a devotee among enthusiasts could have played the role with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>The reason for this rarity of speeches <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> which give a title to a place in literature lies, if we pause to reflect upon it, in the very nature of the speech itself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>This is a declaration in epigrammatic form that the speech which is prepared like an essay and then read or recited, which, in other words, is primarily literature and not oratory, is not a thoroughly good speech, and of the soundness of the doctrine there can hardly be a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>But the theory, however valid, is not without its dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>He was, it may well be thought, the greatest of <name>English</name> orators at the moment of speech, but he is little read and seldom quoted now. What he actually said has faded from the minds of men despite its enchanting, its enormous effect at the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>On the other hand, the speech which is literature before it is spoken is ineffective or only partially effective at the moment, and if it is read afterwards, however much we may enjoy the essay, we never mistake it for the genuine eloquence of the spoken word.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>The highest oratory, therefore, must combine in exact balance the living force and freshness of the spoken word with the literary qualities which alone ensure endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>The best examples of this perfection are to be found in the world of imagination, in the <num value="2">two</num> speeches of <persName n="Brutus,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00095.00764" reg="mostcommon:Brutus,nomatch:0"><surname>Brutus</surname></persName> and Mark <persName><foreName>Antony</foreName></persName> following the death of <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00095.00765" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>It is not the preparation or even the writing out beforehand which makes a speech into an essay, for these things can both be done without detracting from the spontaneity, without dulling the sound of the voice which the wholly great speech must have, even on the printed page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>The speech loses when <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> the literary quality becomes predominant, and absolute success as high as it is rare comes only from the nice balance of the <num value="2">two</num> essential ingredients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>In all, certainly in all the great speeches, is the fine literary quality, always felt, never seen, ever present, never obtrusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>He had the combination of <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00096.00778" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>'s Brutus or <persName><foreName>Antony</foreName></persName>, of <persName n="Demosthenes,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00096.00779" reg="mostcommon:Demosthenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Demosthenes</surname></persName> or <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00096.00780" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,nomatch:0"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>, and when he rose to his greatest heights he reached a place beyond the fear of rivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>The practical proof and exhibition of this fact is apparent if we turn to any serious and large debate in Congress, for there we shall find <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00096.00781" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> quoted, as he is in every session, <num value="20">twenty</num> times as often as any other public man in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>He had strong competitors in his own day and in his own field, able, acute, and brilliant men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>That which has made this possible is his rare combination of speech and literature; it is the literary quality, the literary savour which keeps what <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00097.00785" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> said fresh, strong, and living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>When we open the volumes of his speeches it is not like unrolling the wrappings of an Egyptian mummy, to find within a dry and shrivelled form, a faint perfume alone surviving faintly to recall the vanished days, as when <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>and is still declaimed by schoolboys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>Some of its phrases are familiar quotations and have passed into general speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>Let us recall a single passage: <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>He has done the murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>No eye has seen him; no ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is safe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Ah, gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Such a secret can be safe nowhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>The whole creation of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has neither nook nor corner where the guilty can bestow it and say it is safe. . . . A <num value="1000">thousand</num> eyes turn at once to explore every man, everything, every circumstance connected with the time and place; a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ears catch every whisper; a <num value="1000">thousand</num> excited minds intensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their light, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>Meantime the guilty soul can not keep its own secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>It is false to itself; or, rather, it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>It labours under its guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it. The human heart was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>It finds itself preyed on by a torment which it dares not acknowledge to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> or man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance either from heaven or earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him, and, like the evil spirits of which we read, it overcomes him and leads him whithersoever it will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>It has become his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>When suspicions from without begin to embarrass him and the net of circumstance to entangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>It must be confessed; it will be confessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>Those are words spoken to men, not written for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>It is a speech and nothing else, and yet we feel all through it the literary value and quality which make it imperishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>If now we go back to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00098.00789" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s earlier days we can trace throughout his speeches, once he had escaped from the flowers of eloquence which burdened his youth, the literary touch appearing with increasing frequency until it came continually, quite naturally and without effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>As the sureness of the literary touch increased, so did the taste become refined until it was finally almost unerring.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>The <title>Discourse</title>, as he called it, delivered at <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct> upon the <num value="200" type="ordinal">two hundredth</num> anniversary of the landing of <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> the <name>Pilgrims</name>, was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the great occasional addresses which gave so much fame to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00099.00790" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> as an orator, wholly apart from that which he achieved in Congress or in the courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>It was evidently prepared with extreme care and has less of the effect of words actually spoken than his later work of the same character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>The perfect combination of the literary quality with the spoken word, to which he afterwards attained, has not yet been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>The <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName> <title>Discourse</title> shows his wide knowledge of history, and the historical illustrations are given with an easy mastery of his subject and with a conciseness that saves him from the rambling digression which is at once the temptation and the danger of the historical parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>There are also many passages which contain, in the manner of <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00099.00791" reg="nearbymention:Burke,Edmund,,,"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, philosophical considerations of the science of government and which deal with the general principles affecting social and political problems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>The history and philosophy are all eminently appropriate to his subject and to an address of that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>They give it weight, seriousness, and the permanence which lasts far beyond the moment of speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The manner in which they are used and introduced is distinctly literary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>But we also find in this address something more, the purely literary quality in the style and in the thought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>It is this literary quality which concerns us here, and to appreciate it we must mark the distinction, often a very narrow <num value="1">one</num>, between the rhetorical and the literary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Rhetoric is of course in its place a branch of literature, but it may be of the utmost excellence and yet lack the highest literary quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Rhetoric is out of place in purely literary work which is not dramatic in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Yet curiously enough it is not misplaced in poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>Rhetorical verse, although not the highest kind of poetry, may yet be in its own sphere very admirable indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>On the other hand, to put rhetoric, except in dramatic passages, into literary prose is almost as bad as to write metred prose, of which <persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00100.00794" reg="mostcommon:Dickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName> was guilty in the description of the death of Little Nell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>But when we come to giving the literary touch to rhetoric the exact reverse is the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>The rhetoric is at once lifted up and illuminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>The only objection is that the art is as rare as it is difficult, to be found in only a few great masters of speech in human history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>It was precisely in this rare and difficult art that <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00100.00795" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> excelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>His rhetoric was always unimpeachable, but his peculiar power lay in the fact that he was able to give to it with ever-increasing ease the imperishable literary quality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>We detect the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gleams of this beautiful art in the <rs>Plymouth</rs> oration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>It is not necessary to take as an example the celebrated passage about the slave trade, where the rhetoric predominates; less familiar sentences prove the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>He is speaking of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>No sculptured marble, no enduring monument, no honourable inscription, no ever burning taper that would drive away the darkness of the tomb, can soften our sense of the reality of death, and hallow to our feelings the ground which is to cover us, like the consciousness that we shall sleep, dust to dust, with the objects of our affections.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>The thought in these passages is simple, oft-recurrent, entirely familiar, expressed by many other orators with great effect and received by genuinely moved audiences with much applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>But listen to them again, read them, and it will be found that <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00101.00797" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s sentences have a quality which all the others lack.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>Let us take <num value="1">one</num> more example from his early days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Rhetorically this passage is all that could be desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>The sentences are short, effective, possessing both balance and precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>But when we come to the last we find the literary touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>Let us take <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other familiar passages from the later speeches when the style was perfected and when the literary quality had become a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>As <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00101.00800" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> stood <num value="1">one</num> summer morning on the ramparts of <placeName reg="Quebec" key="tgn,7005804">Quebec</placeName>, and heard the sound of drums and saw the <rs>English</rs> troops on parade, the thought of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s vast world empire came strongly to his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>The thought was very natural under the circumstances, not at all remarkable nor in the least original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Some years later, in a speech in the <name>Senate</name>, he put his thought into words, and this, as everyone knows, is the way he did it: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>A power which has dotted over the surface of the whole globe with her possessions and military posts, whose morning drumbeat, following the sun and keeping company with the hours, circles the <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> earth with <num value="1">one</num> continuous and unbroken strain of the martial airs of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p></quote> The sentence has followed the drumbeat round the world and has been repeated in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and in the antipodes by men who never heard of <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00102.00801" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> and probably did not know that this splendid description of the <rs>British Empire</rs> was due to an American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>It is not the thought which has carried these words so far through time and space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>It is the beauty of the imagery and the magic of the style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>Let me take <num value="1">one</num> more very simple example of the quality which distinguishes <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00102.00802" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s speeches above those of others, which makes his words and serious thoughts live on when others, equally weighty and serious, perhaps, sleep or die. In his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName> oration he apostrophized the monument, just as anyone else might have tried to do, and this is what he said: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>Let it rise, let it rise till it meet the sun in his coming; let the earliest light of morning gild it, and parting day linger and play on its summit.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>Here the thought is nothing, the style everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can repeat those words and be deaf to their music or insensible to the rhythm and beauty of the prose with the <rs>Saxon</rs> words relieved just sufficiently by the <rs>Latin</rs> derivatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>The ease with which it is done may be due to training, but the ability to do it comes from natural gifts which, as <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00102.00803" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName> says, <q direct="unspecified">we value more as we get older because they can not be stuck on.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>Possibly to some people it may seem very simple to utter such a sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/><num value="1">One</num> can only repeat what <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00102.00804" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Walter,,,:2"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> says somewhere about <persName n="Swift,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00102.00805" reg="mostcommon:Swift,nomatch:0"><surname>Swift</surname></persName>'s style, perhaps the purest and strongest we have in the language.

<p>It is not easy to say how much <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00102.00808" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s literary art was due to intentional cultivation and how far it was purely instinctive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>Undoubtedly he had a natural gift as certainly as he had an ear for the arrangement and cadence of words; but we know that he cared for style and had strong preferences in the choice of the words he used to express his thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>We have the right to infer, therefore, that he was quite aware of <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> the art which he practised so admirably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>The highly conscious art which we see in <persName n="Sterne,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00103.00809" reg="mostcommon:Sterne,nomatch:0"><surname>Sterne</surname></persName>, or in <persName n="Pater,,Walter,,," id="n0199.0006.00103.00810" reg="default:Pater,Walter,,,"><foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Pater</surname></persName> in our own time, to take <num value="2">two</num> examples at random, and which is so effective in its results, is not apparent in <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00103.00811" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>He would probably not have been <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest of orators if it had been, for then the writer would have absorbed the speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>We are conscious of his art, although he does not seem to be conscious of it himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>Yet, however much we may speculate as to the proportions of intentional art and of unaided natural gifts in the style of all he said, there can be no question that he possessed and had mastered the rare combination which confers the lasting quality of literature upon the speech without losing the living force of the written word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>It is this most rare achievement which gives to <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0199.0006.00103.00812" reg="mostcommon:Webster,Noah,,,:4"><surname>Webster</surname></persName>, who never wrote book or essay or verse, his uncontested place in the history of American literature. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>The Revolutionary War gave our historians new motives for writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>A glorious struggle was to be described; the states, just raised out of the rank of colonies, began to demand the preservation of their earliest history; and the nation, inspired by great hopes for the future, felt that it must have loyal men to prepare the record of common growth and common achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>That is, he could not possibly have been an actor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>Among these practices was that of reprinting an old annual with a new name, sometimes with change of plates and of leading article; or that of bestowing on an inferior work a name that had been made popular by another publisher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>Scarcity of paper was acute; type worn out could not be replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>The appearance of the newspapers deteriorated, and issues sometimes failed to appear at all. Mail service, never good, was poorer than ever; foreign newspapers, an important source of information, could be obtained but rarely; many of the ablest writers who had filled the columns with dissertations upon colonial rights and government were now otherwise occupied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>News from a distance was less full and regular than before; yet when great events happened reports spread over the <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> country with great rapidity, through messengers in the service of patriotic organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>The newspapers made use of such assistance, and did service in further spreading the tidings, though they seldom overtook the flying word of mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>Naturally, reporting was still imperfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>The <orgName n="Salem Gazette" type="newspaper">Salem <title>Gazette</title></orgName> printed a full but coloured account of the <rs n="Battle of Lexington" type="battle">battle of Lexington</rs>, giving details of the burning, pillage, and barbarities charged to the <rs>British</rs>, and praising the militia who were filled with <q direct="unspecified">higher sentiments of humanity.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> was published by Congress, <dateStruct value="1776-07-6"><day reg="6">6</day> <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1776</year>,</dateStruct> in the <rs>Philadelphia</rs> <title><orgName n="Evening Post" type="newspaper">Evening post</orgName></title>, from which it was copied by most of the papers; but some of them did not mention it until <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> later, and even then found room for only a synopsis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>When they were permitted to do so they printed fairly full accounts of the proceedings of provincial assemblies and of Congress, which were copied widely, as were all official reports and proclamations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>On the whole, however, a relatively small proportion of such material and an inadequate account of the progress of the war is found in the contemporaneous newspapers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>The general spirit of the time found fuller utterance in mottoes, editorials, letters, and poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>In the beginning both editorials and communications urged united resistance to oppression, praised patriotism, and denounced tyranny; as events and public sentiment developed these grew more vigorous, often a little more radical than the populace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>Later, the idea of independence took form, and theories of government were discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>More interesting and valuable as specimens of literature than these discussions were the poems inspired by the stirring events of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>Long narratives of battles and of heroic deaths were mingled with eulogies of departed heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>Songs meant to inspire and thrill were not lacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>Humour, pathos, and satire sought to stir the feelings of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>Much of the poetry of the <name>Revolution</name> is to be found in the columns of dingy newspapers, from the vivid and popular satires and narratives of <persName n="Freneau,,,,," id="n0199.0010.00177.01585" reg="nearbymention:Freneau,Philip,,,"><surname>Freneau</surname></persName><note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>The newspapers of the <name>Revolution</name> were an effective force working towards the unification of sentiment, the awakening of a consciousness of a common purpose, interest, and destiny <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> among the separate colonies, and of a determination to see the war through to a successful issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>They were more single-minded than the people themselves, and they bore no small share of the burden of arousing and supporting the often discouraged and indifferent public spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>Many of the papers, however, which were kept alive or brought to life during the war could not adapt themselves to the new conditions of peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>Perhaps a dozen of the survivors held their own in the new time, notably the <rs>Boston</rs> <title>Gazette</title>, which declined rapidly in the following decade, <title>The Connecticut Courant</title> of <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, <title>The <persName n="Gazette,,Providence,,," id="n0199.0010.00178.01586" reg="default:Gazette,Providence,,,"><foreName>Providence</foreName> <surname>Gazette</surname></persName></title>, and <title>The Pennsylvania Packet</title> of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, to which may be added such representative papers as <title>The Massachusetts Spy</title>, the <rs>Boston</rs> <title>Independent chronicle</title>, the <orgName n="New York Journal" type="newspaper">New York <title>Journal</title></orgName> and <title>Packet</title>, the <orgName n="Newport Mercury" type="newspaper">Newport <title>Mercury</title></orgName>, <title>The <persName n="Gazette,,Maryland,,," id="n0199.0010.00178.01587" reg="default:Gazette,Maryland,,,"><foreName>Maryland</foreName> <surname>Gazette</surname></persName></title> of <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName>, <title>The <persName n="Gazette,,Pennsylvania,,," id="n0199.0010.00178.01588" reg="default:Gazette,Pennsylvania,,,"><foreName>Pennsylvania</foreName> <surname>Gazette</surname></persName></title> and <title>The <placeName key="tgn,7007710" n="1.000 13" reg="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</placeName> journal</title>, both of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>Conditions were hardly more favourable to newspapers than during the recent conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>The sources of news were much the same; the means of communication and the postal system were little improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>Newspapers were not carried in the mails but by favour of the postmen, and the money of <num value="1">one</num> state was of dubious value in another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>Consequently circulations were small, rarely reaching a <num value="1000">thousand</num>; subscribers were slow in paying; and advertisements were not plentiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>Newspapers remained subject to provincial laws of libel, in accordance with the old common law, and were, as in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> for a short time in <dateStruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></dateStruct>, subject to special state taxes on paper or on advertisements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>But public sentiment was <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> growing strongly against all legal restrictions, and in general the papers practised freedom, not to say license, of utterance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>With independence had come the consciousness of a great destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>The collective spirit aroused by the war, though clouded by conflicting local difficulties, was intense, and the principal interest of the newspapers was to create a nation out of the loose confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>Business and commerce were their next care; but in an effort to be all things to all men, the small page included a little of whatever might <q direct="unspecified">interest, instruct, or amuse.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>Political intelligence occupied first place; news, in the modem sense, was subordinated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>A new idea, quite as much as a fire, a murder, or a prodigy, was a matter of news moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>There were always a few items of local interest, usually placed with paragraphs of editorial miscellany.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>Correspondents, in return for the paper, sent items; private letters, often no doubt written with a view to such use, were a fruitful source of news; but the chief resource was the newspapers which every office received as exchanges, carried in the post free of charge, and the newspapers from abroad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>The newspaper continued to compete with the magazine by supplying moral, descriptive, and sentimental essays, poetry, anecdotes, reflections, and articles on trade, education, and conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>The editor, usually reflecting the sentiment of a group or a faction, began to emerge as a distinct power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>He closely followed the drift of events and expressed vigorous opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>The growing importance of the newspaper was shown in the discussions preceding the <rs>Federal Convention</rs>, and notably in the countrywide debate on the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in which the <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> newspaper largely displaced the pamphlet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>Their decline, in the late thirties, was coincident with great changes, both political and journalistic, and though successors arose, their kind was not again so prominent or influential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>The newspaper of national scope was passing away, yielding to the influence of the telegraph and the railroad, which robbed the <rs>Washington</rs> press of its claim to prestige as the chief source of political news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>In contrast with the situation today, when the magazines are generally conducted by men whose tastes and ideals have been formed in journalism rather than in literature, and assume more and more the characteristics of timeliness, until the middle of the century the newspapers owed their character to men of literary tastes and pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>When <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n0199.0010.00185.01649" reg="nearbymention:Bennett,James,Gordon,,"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> the elder referred slurringly to the <q direct="unspecified">poets of the <title>Post</title></q> and the <title>Post</title> declared that <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n0199.0010.00185.01650" reg="nearbymention:Bennett,James,Gordon,,"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> was not a journalist, a momentous divergence and change of ideals was indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>Within a decade the cheap newspaper was begun; steam presses were introduced; a radical alteration took place in the idea of news values, reporting, and correspondence; freedom from party control was found possible; and important modifications took place in the party press.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>Several of these changes are exemplified in the work of <persName n="Bennett,,James,Gordon,," id="n0199.0010.00186.01651" reg="default:Bennett,James,Gordon,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Gordon</foreName> <surname>Bennett</surname></persName> (<dateStruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></dateStruct>), though he originated few of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>In more than <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of unsuccessful effort as a political journalist he had become familiar with the increasing enterprise in news-gathering that had already distinguished American methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>He despised the journalism of the day&mdash; the seriousness of tone, the phlegmatic dignity, the party affiliations, the sense of responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>He believed journalists were fools to think that they could best serve their own purposes by serving the politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>As <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> correspondent for the New York <title>Enquirer</title>, he wrote vivacious, gossipy prattle, full of insignificant and entertaining detail, to which he added keen characterization and deft allusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>The idea which he did much to develop rested on the success of the <num value="1">one</num>-cent press created by the establishment of the <orgName n="New York Sun" type="newspaper">New York <title>Sun</title></orgName> in <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>This idea of news and the newspaper for its own sake, the unprecedented aggressiveness in news-gathering, and the blatant methods by which the cheap papers were popularized aroused the antagonism of the older papers, but created a competition which could not be ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>Systems of more rapid newsgathering and distribution quickly appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>Telegraphic columns became a leading feature; news associations grew as the wires lengthened; but the greatest effect on the journalism of the country at large was to decentralize the press by rendering the inland papers, in such cities as <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and New Orleans independent of those in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>In a period of wide-spread unrest and change many specialized forms of journalism sprang up&mdash;religious, educational, agricultural, and commercial, which there is no space here to discuss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>The subject of controversy most critically related to journalism was abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>Out of the period of restless change in the thirties there emerged a few great editors whose force and ability gave them and their newspapers an influence hitherto unequalled, and made the period between <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> that of personal journalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>These few men not only interpreted and reflected the spirit of the time, but were of great influence in shaping and directing public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>Consequently the scope, character, and influence of newspapers was in the period immensely widened and enriched, and rendered relatively free from the worst subjection to political control.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>Naturally, the outstanding feature of this personal journalism was the editorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>Rescued from the slough of ponderousness into which it had fallen in its abject and uninspired party service, the editorial was revived, invigorated, and endowed with a vitality that made it the centre about which all other features of the newspaper were grouped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>It was individual; however large the staff of writers, the editorials were regarded as the utterance of the editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>His power was great, but it came from his genius in gathering and presenting news rather than from editorial discussion, for he had no great moral, social or political ideals, and his influence, always lawless and uncertain, can hardly be regarded as characteristic of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>Of the others named, and many besides, it could be said with <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> approximate truth that their ideal was <q direct="unspecified">a full presentation and a liberal discussion of all questions of public concernment, from an entirely independent position, and a faithful and impartial exhibition of all movements of interest at home and abroad.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>As all <num value="3">three</num> were not only upright and independent, but in various measure gifted with the quality of statesmanship at once philosophical and practical, their newspapers were powerful moulders of opinion at a critical period in the history of the nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>The news field was immeasurably broadened; news style was improved; interviews, newly introduced, lent the ease and freshness of dialogue and direct quotation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>There was a notable improvement in the reporting of business, markets, and finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>In a few papers the literary department was conducted by staffs as able as any today.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>A foreign news service was developed which in intelligence, fidelity, and general excellence reached the highest standard yet attained in American journalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>The growth of these papers meant the development of great staffs of workers that exceeded in numbers anything dreamed of in the preceding period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>Although later journalism has far exceeded in this respect the time we are now considering, still the scope, complexity, and excellence of our modem metropolitan journalism in all its aspects were clearly begun between <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>Everyone who lived in the village had been born there, was proud of that accident, loved whatever natural beauty its trees and meadows afforded, and enjoyed a conscious satisfaction that it was not like other places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>Among the residents there might be a great personage, or even a poet, and there were certain to be enough teachers, ministers, <rs type="role" n="Doctor">doctors</rs>, judges, and writers to make up a coterie where ideas circulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>The effect of these movements on his own thought are manifest in his poetry and essays mainly by implication and suggestion; but in the utterances of the last decade of his life he often looks upon both his own career and the <rs>American</rs> purpose directly from this more modern point of view.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>This ambition dictated the character of his journalism and the substance of his speeches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>In his newspaper he endeavoured without shadow of turning to draw attention to the material resources of the <rs>South</rs> and to develop her industries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>This purpose in part explains the form of those addresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>He was delivering an appeal to his public, not conducting a legal argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>They reflect, too, in many ways the sonorous models of Southern oratory that formed the pattern and ideal for his youthful attempts.

He was not only a product of Reconstruction but he contributed much to the progress and prosperity of his section in the new era. Born <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> before the war on a Virginia plantation, his mother a slave, his father he knew not who, he a few years after the war joined in that rush for an education which seized great numbers of the freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>The acuteness of that struggle, the inspiring tenacity with which it was maintained, form <num value="1">one</num> of the bright pages in that dark period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>When he had completed his studies in <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>, he turned aside from the opportunities for political preferment which lured many of his race to destruction, and devoted his days and his nights to the upbuilding of his fellow freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>In <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct> he was called to the obscure village of <placeName reg="Tuskegee, Macon, Alabama" key="tgn,7014669">Tuskegee</placeName> in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> to take charge of what was to be a <orgName n="Normal School" type="school">normal school</orgName> for coloured people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>For he there worked out with dauntless persistence a scheme for education which would fit the negro to his actual surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>Consecrating all of his vast energy to that cause, he became long before his death the foremost representative of his race in the world, a writer known in every section of his own country, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most eloquent speakers of his generation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>Of his addresses, typical is the <num value="5">five</num>-minute speech delivered at the <rs n="Atlanta Exposition" type="exposition">Atlanta exposition</rs> <dateStruct value="1895-09-17"><day reg="17">17</day> <month reg="09">September</month>, <year>1895</year>,</dateStruct> which made him the recognized leader of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>Aside from the fact that it presented a platform so simple, yet so fundamental in its assumptions, that both <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> could stand thereon, it illustrates well the guiding principles of his rhetoric, that every word shall mean something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>There is in it little of that fatally easy use of superlatives, that sonorous succession of periods, which so tickled the ears of old-time audiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>There is little of the habitual resort to cunning balance and alliteration which even <persName n="Grady,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00324.03041" reg="nearbymention:Grady,Henry,Woodfin,,"><surname>Grady</surname></persName> constantly introduced to secure his effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>It is simple, direct, vivid, yet sustained by a high devotion to the future of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4022"/>Not only in its message but in its style it speaks of the New South.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4023"/>His writings display the same characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4024"/>Of these, his autobiography, consisting of <title>Up from slavery</title> and <title>Working with hands</title>, forms <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest records America has to show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/>Of his other voluminous writings, dealing almost exclusively with the colored race, weighty is <title>The future of the <rs>American</rs> negro</title>, which contains his views on the enigma which ever confronts the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>Not founding his argument on those lofty conceptions of right and justice which aroused such fanatical zeal before the war, but with a sanity of outlook upon the industrial situation in the <rs>South</rs> and an unclouded vision of the progress of his race in the past and of the necessary steps in future advance, he discusses the various aspects of the problem with a dispassionate but illuminating calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>Though his contact with the more steadfast and aspiring kind of negro may have filled him with undue hope, yet no reader can fail to admire his self-forgetful devotion to his race, or refuse to accord him a high place among the prose writers of the New South.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>Like most Southern youths after the war, he drifted about for a time between <num value="2">two</num> worlds, <measure n="1" type="dead">one dead</measure>, the other powerless to be born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>In <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct> he joined the staff of the <title>News and Courier</title>, and after a brief excursion into commercial life in New York he returned in <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct> as associate editor, where in failing health he remained the rest of his days.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>In later years he came to take refuge in poetry from the distresses of life, to find in it an anodyne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>Probably the best example of this mood, <title>Sapelo</title>, illustrates not only the finish of his verse, which lifts him above the rhymesters of his section, but at the same time the lack of that inspiration or individual power which would give him a secure place in the poetical annals of our country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>It is individuality of style that strikingly distinguishes another Reconstruction poet who could never forget the <rs>Lost Cause</rs> and who sought solace in the realms of poesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4265"/>What differentiates this treatment from preceding ones is the insistence that the laws of music and verse are identical, that every foot represents a mathematically equal time interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>Length of interval, and not accent, is therefore the determining element in prosody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>The valuable feature of this theory is that it emphasizes the relation of music and poetry and the fundamental importance of rhythm in poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>Its unfortunate feature is that it insists too strongly on law. No such mathematical relation exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>Accent normally appears at equal time intervals and an accented syllable tends to acquire length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>But <persName n="Lanier,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00341.03128" reg="nearbymention:Lanier,Sidney,,,"><surname>Lanier</surname></persName> wrote long before the psychological investigation of rhythm had begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>He therefore could not see the impossibility of trying to reduce to <num value="1">one</num> rule all the innumerable individual senses of rhythm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>Not only no <num value="2">two</num> poets but no <num value="2">two</num> readers would exactly coincide in their sense of rhythm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4273"/><persName n="Lanier,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00341.03129" reg="nearbymention:Lanier,Sidney,,,"><surname>Lanier</surname></persName> was on the right road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4274"/>He merely made the mistake of taking his own sense of rhythm for a universal law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>Of his other prose writings the letters are the most important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>They reveal the man with unusual fullness&mdash;the pulsating sea of emotion in which he lived, his exuberance, his passionate love of music, his wavering literary ambition, his buoyancy and humour and occasional despondency, together with his intellectual interests and preferences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>Few letters written in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> are more interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>Yet on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dipping into them <num value="1">one</num> is repelled by the same qualities which frequently give <num value="1">one</num> pause in his other writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>The style seems highly artificial, fanciful in its imagery, strained and rhetorical in its phrasing, bookish and precious in its diction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>Even in his last years he was rarely simple and direct, for he had from boyhood so steeped himself in the older writers of our tongue, <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00341.03130" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> in particular, that a plain and natural way of putting things would have seemed to him insipid, inane, and inartistic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>The literary glamour which he casts over his writings, which draws attention from the thought itself to some supposed felicity of expression, never entirely left him. Yet some of his later books, particularly where he is pouring forth his convictions on music, literature, and life, possess all the fluency of the Old South, without ceasing to be strong, luminous, and eloquent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>These shortcomings have been explained away on the ground that his prose is the prose of a poet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>Certainly it is as a poet that he jumps to the front rank among Southern writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>The single volume of his verse, gathered with loving care by his wife <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> after his death, is paramount among his writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>Upon that corer-stone must be reared whatever reputation he may attain in American letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>Yet his poetry too suffers from defects similar to those in his prose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>His verse in general betrays a lack of spontaneity without obtaining that finish, that technical polish, that wedding of word and thought which <persName n="Tabb,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00342.03131" reg="nearbymention:Tabb,John,Banister,,"><surname>Tabb</surname></persName> achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>There are, to be sure, moments of fine phrasing, intermittent flashes from the heaven of song: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/></p><l>Music is love in search of a word</l> <l>or</l> <l>For when <name n="God" type="God">God</name> frowns, 'tis then ye shine.</l></quote> But the general impression is of an elaborated verse, not a gush of words from the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>Indeed, it seems to have been <persName n="Lanier,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00342.03132" reg="nearbymention:Lanier,Sidney,,,"><surname>Lanier</surname></persName>'s practice to write out the ideas of his poems in prose before turning them into verse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>Not many of his poems sang themselves over in his soul before he committed them to paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>He was, on the other hand, forever haunted by ideas for poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>As an obscure lawyer in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> he complained to <persName n="Hayne,,Paul,Hamilton,," id="n0199.0017.00342.03133" reg="default:Hayne,Paul,Hamilton,,"><foreName>Paul</foreName> <foreName>Hamilton</foreName> <surname>Hayne</surname></persName> of the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1000">thousand</num> various songs that oppress me, unsung.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>Even after he had won the ear of the nation, he wrote to <persName n="Peacock,,Gibson,,," id="n0199.0017.00342.03134" reg="default:Peacock,Gibson,,,"><foreName>Gibson</foreName> <surname>Peacock</surname></persName>: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>I'm taken with a poem pretty nearly every day, and have to content myself with making a note of its train of thought on the back of whatever letter is in my pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>I don't write it out, because I find my poetry now wholly unsatisfactory.</p></quote> <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> Sometimes a poem, like <title>The Symphony</title>, would shake him like a <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> ague until he had finished it. Sometimes he would revise patiently, as in <title>Corn</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>In general it is true that he did not work in that calm serenity which might have brought him closer to perfection of form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> blemish, however, that no amount of revision would have eliminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>His exuberant fancy betrayed him into conceits as far fetched as ever disfigured Donne or Crashaw or <persName n="Tabb,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00343.03135" reg="nearbymention:Tabb,John,Banister,,"><surname>Tabb</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>He did not see the grotesqueness of such comparisons, but cultivated them as original adornments to his verse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>Some of the dissatisfaction with the form of his verse is due to his theory that the principles of music and of metrics are identical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>His sense of rhythm did not allow sufficient emphasis for accent as marking the equal intervals of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>But he was, naturally, enamoured of his own theory and felt happier when he put it into practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>Of <title>Special pleading</title>, composed in <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>, he wrote: <q direct="unspecified">I have allowed myself to treat words, similes, and metres with such freedom as I desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>The result convinces me I can do so safely.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>Thereafter he developed his own peculiar style more courageously, sometimes with beautiful effect, but often with the resulting impression of a straining for form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>In <title>Sunrise</title>, for example, there is a passage descriptive of approaching dawn, beginning, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/></p><l>Oh, what if a sound should be made!</l></quote> which is unsurpassed in American poetry for its rendering of the ecstasy in the poet's heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>Yet only a few lines above this marvellous description is a section beginning, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/></p><l>Ye lispers, whisperers, singers in storms,</l></quote> which illustrates how far his attention wandered from the thought in his elaboration of form, how he forgot that words are primarily symbolic, and that beauty of verse depends on poetic and beautiful thoughts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>Indeed, it must be confessed that <persName n="Lanier,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00343.03137" reg="nearbymention:Lanier,Sidney,,,"><surname>Lanier</surname></persName>'s thought is liable on analysis to be found commonplace and prosaic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/>This quality is partly due to a didacticism that issued from an unswerving <pb id="p.344" n="344"/> devotion to the ideal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>From his youth he cherished a longing for the very highest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>How amid the uninspiring surroundings of his boyhood he should have developed this allegiance to the <q direct="unspecified">sweet, living lands of Art</q> is another of those mysteries with which the history of literature abounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>Yet there is no mystery about the moral purpose which led him to employ poetry to combat intolerance, brutality, and commercialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>It was bred into him at his mother's knee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4318"/>There is no cynicism in his verse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>There is a very strong religious strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>Not only does he curiously eschew all mythological allusions as being pagan in spirit, but he expresses a deeply religious view of life in many poems, as in <title>The Crystal</title> and that quaint but unsurpassed <title>Ballad of trees and the master</title>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>His idealism is also revealed in his eager intellectual interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>Here too he triumphed over his untoward surroundings, as the brief sketch of his life has indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>Pathetic witness to this inherent bent is found in a letter to <persName n="Taylor,,Bayard,,," id="n0199.0017.00344.03138" reg="default:Taylor,Bayard,,,"><foreName>Bayard</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>He sought in poetry no refuge from the hard conditions of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>Rather is he <num value="1">one</num> of the leaders of the New South because he grasped at the intellectual and social problems of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>He dealt with the necessity of planting corn for cotton, with the nascent oppression of labour by capital, with the mission of music and art. His reading of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00344.03139" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,William,,,:2"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> in the winter of <dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1877--"><year reg="1877">7</year></dateStruct> revived an earlier penchant for metaphysics and led to such poems as <hi rend="italics">A Florida Sunday</hi> and <title>Individuality</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>If these abstruse problems are not handled with power, they at least do honour to the author's lofty purpose and sincerity of execution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>It must be conceded, too, that the profound and abiding interests of his life&mdash;love and nature&mdash;are peculiarly Southern <pb id="p.345" n="345"/> in their colouring and substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>It is characteristic that love is for him not that fleshly passion which has thrilled and burned in verse since <persName n="Sappho,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00345.03140" reg="mostcommon:Sappho,nomatch:0"><surname>Sappho</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4332"/>It is a kneeling adoration, an ideal emotion, the only love which <num value="1">one</num> of his purity of life would avow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>He has been well called the <rs>Sir Galahad</rs> of American literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/><title>My springs</title> shows how deep and sincere was the inspiration he received from his dearest partner in misfortune and ill-health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>But there was mingled with the personal devotion to <num value="1">one</num> woman a chivalric devotion to women which came partly from the <rs>Southern</rs> ideals of his day. There is in his poetry no better expression of this than in <title>The Symphony</title>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>Nature was to him almost equally dear, and even more Southern in its appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>He found nothing within to answer to the wild and rugged majesty of the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>He felt no expansion of the soul in viewing the limitless plains of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>The broad sand-flats of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> roused only a longing for the <rs type="place">Georgia hills</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>Indeed, the only scene which called forth a love of broad, free places was the long and often viewed marshes at <placeName reg="Brunswick, Glynn, Georgia" key="tgn,2022283">Brunswick, Georgia</placeName>, which will go down in American literature in the eloquent and musical <title>Marshes of <persName n="Glynn,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00345.03141" reg="mostcommon:Glynn,nomatch:0"><surname>Glynn</surname></persName></title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4341"/>It remains true, however, that his love for nature was a delicate and passionate love, the love of an attentive and scrupulous observer of leaves and plants and the <num value="1000">thousand</num> minute details of the summer woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>So personal was the solace and uplifting of nature that he addressed her various forms with terms of endearment, more warm than <persName n="Tabb,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00345.03142" reg="nearbymention:Tabb,John,Banister,,"><surname>Tabb</surname></persName>, yet precisely like <placeName key="tgn,2637157" n="1.000 2" reg="saint francis, cross, arkansas">St. Francis</placeName> of Assisi.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>Though his abiding interests were Southern, he was not narrowly Southern in his outlook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>On the contrary, it has already been indicated that much of <persName n="Lanier,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00345.03143" reg="nearbymention:Lanier,Sidney,,,"><surname>Lanier</surname></persName>'s distinction among Reconstruction poets lies not only in his interest in the problems of his own time but likewise his sympathy and comprehension in voicing the new idea of nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>The <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> freedom from prejudice which led him to resume relations with a Northern friend at the close of the war, fitted him to sing the meditations of <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> at the <rs>Philadelphia Centennial</rs> in <dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>There was nothing mean or narrow in his make-up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>He leaped far ahead of his section in grasping and appropriating what he might of the new quickening spirit, but he was largely influential, with <persName n="Lamar,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00346.03144" reg="mostcommon:Lamar,Lucius,Quintus,Cincinnatus:1,:1"><surname>Lamar</surname></persName> and <persName n="Grady,,,,," id="n0199.0017.00346.03145" reg="mostcommon:Grady,Henry,Woodfin,,:2"><surname>Grady</surname></persName>, in bringing the <rs>South</rs> to share in that quickening influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5270"/>It has, indeed, several times been observed that <num value="1">one</num> can get more of American life from the juvenile than from the adult fiction of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5271"/>To a large extent, this is implicit in the problem of interesting children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>The growing independence of American children appeared in the successive <pb id="p.407" n="407"/> books written to appeal to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>Parents and guardians, so important in <name>English</name> books, figure very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/>In the most popular books, boys and girls are thrown on the world or leave home to seek their fortunes or have adult responsibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>The reforming child was an American creation and persevered in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> some time after she had been happily throttled in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 7" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; and her strenuosity was even more offensive because of the lack of grown &mdash; up authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/>American book-children are always the king-pins of their households as well as of their stories, and often their sagacious ability is thrown into relief by weak-minded parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>It cannot be denied that all this reflects the attitude of American life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5282"/>Also, <num value="1">one</num> may gather from children's stories&mdash;with less misgiving&mdash;that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> evinced in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the century more interest in education than did any other country and in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> half more interest in the analytic study of child-life by reason of an earlier appropriation of the kindergarten theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5283"/>On account of this interest, the moral and the educational as leading features were suppressed sooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5284"/>As the growing psychological study of the child demanded that his initiative be unhampered by patterns, so his pranks began to be recorded, as more personal (as well as more interesting) than his good behaviour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5285"/>Finally, it may be said that because of this kindergarten impulse more conscientious, intelligent work has been done in American writing for children than has been the case elsewhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5286"/>But in <num value="1">one</num> way, equally characteristic of the <rs>American</rs> temperament and American adult literature, children's writers have lagged behind the <rs>European</rs> world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>In the domain of pure fancy very little has been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>As the century entered its closing decades protests were heard against the prevailing realism, and appeals for the restoration of those idealistic qualities which enkindle the child's imagination elsewhere.
