<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Every family had its lane leading back to the clearing, and at that time there lay just beyond the brick house, on the south side of the road, near that curve on which we now swing into the boulevard toward <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, a great pine swamp, the stumps of whose trunks still tell the passers of woods perhaps once like the cathedral woods of Intervale, but now perhaps indicating by their submergence, a slow subsidence of this land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Of course, much of the interior is restoration, and even the bricks of some of the old fireplaces are replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>But take it all in all, it is still a house of exceptional charm within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The inside <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> measurements were <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure>, <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> in length, <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> in depth, and <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure>, <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> in height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>I think <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> or <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth</placeName> suggested that to the <rs>Captain</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>In both the rear northern rooms were kitchen fireplaces, with brick ovens and cranes, so that both families could cook independently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Those in the attic might have been used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>The old attic was perhaps the most interesting place of all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>They pointed out to me also the fine old chamfering on the great cross beams and the fine ornamental string courses of brick without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The bricks were said by older tradition to be of a different shape and color from those used elsewhere in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and so the tradition ran that they were imported from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, but the bricks of <num value="1">one</num> of the old <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0334.0011.00054.00530" reg="nearbymention:Wellington,Isaac,,,"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> houses which was torn down were similar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/><num value="1">One</num> other splendid example of local tradition we learned while we were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>That was that an ancient tunnel once ran from the northwest corner of the building out to a point some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300feet" type="distance">three hundred feet</measure> to the north, thus permitting escape from Indians in extreme <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>If <num value="1">one</num> has a really old house, why not make the most of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>And that was <num value="1">one</num> of the finest legends I had yet heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The present owner, <persName n="Warren,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0011.00055.00531" reg="nearbymention:Warren,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName>, had been twice warned by old residents to avoid trouble when he excavated cellars for the new houses he is building on <address><street n="Spring street">Spring street</street></address>. Twice was the ground reported to have caved in previously, in both instances along a given line leading toward the house, and <persName n="Warren,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0011.00055.00532" reg="nearbymention:Warren,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName> was warned of the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Added to this was the fact that part of the cellar in the northwest corner was unexcavated, and doubtless concealed the other terminal of the tunnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>My enthusiasm was stirred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>A splendid opportunity to compensate for the lost glory of the <name>Cradock</name>, earliest house, tradition!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>But <persName n="Mann,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0011.00055.00533" reg="nearbymention:Mann,Moses,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName> was inexorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>He pricked up his ears at the mention of the cave-ins, but said <persName n="Warren,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0011.00055.00534" reg="nearbymention:Warren,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName> would find no tunnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>I added the fact that some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago <num value="2">two</num> boys had discovered indisputable treasure in an old iron kettle on the very grounds, tradition already says, on the northwest corner of the <name>Cradock</name>-<placeName reg="Peter Tufts house">Peter Tufts house</placeName>; but while <persName n="Mann,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0011.00055.00535" reg="nearbymention:Mann,Moses,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName> admitted this, he seemed singularly unready to grasp a pick-axe and start in digging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>When I went home and studied this account I noted that the bulkhead entrance at present is on the east, while it used to be on the west, and I wondered whether it were not possible that the supposedly unexcavated portion of the cellar concealed this old and doubtless closed entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>There was no trace of it within or without, but the fact of the western, now concealed, cellar door may have given rise to the legend of the tunnel entrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Wonderful opportunity for original research.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>and would he delay doing a work which every day showed to be indispensable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>He was the only man then who had the funds to build such a house, and he was the only man who needed it. Taking all these circumstances into consideration, the inference is clear, that the <q direct="unspecified">old fort,</q> so called, was <placeName><persName n="Cradock,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0012.00058.00548" reg="nearbymention:Cradock,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, built in <dateStruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>It is certainly well placed for a house of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>It is on land slightly elevated, where no higher land or rocks could be used by enemies to assail it, and is so near the river as to allow of reinforcements from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Its walls are <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>It was probably built for retreat and defence; but some of the reasons for calling it a fort are not conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Outside shutters were in common use in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at the time above mentioned; and so was it common to ornament houses with round or oval openings on each side of the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>It is probable, that, as soon as the spring opened, they began to dig the clay, which was abundant in that place; and very soon they had their bricks ready for use.
