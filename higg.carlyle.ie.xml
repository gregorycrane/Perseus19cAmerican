<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>None of the many sketches of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00002.00020" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> that have been published since his death have brought out quite distinctly enough the thing which struck me more forcibly than all else, when in the actual presence of the man; namely, the peculiar quality and expression of his laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It need hardly be said that there is a great deal in a laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most telling pieces of oratory that ever reached my ears was <persName n="Hugo,,Victor,,," id="n0215.0002.00002.00021" reg="default:Hugo,Victor,,,"><foreName>Victor</foreName> <surname>Hugo</surname></persName>'s vindication, at the <rs>Voltaire Centenary</rs> in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, of that author's smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>To be sure, <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00002.00022" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s laugh was not like that smile, but it was something as inseparable from his personality, and as essential to the account, when making up <num value="1">one</num>'s estimate of him. It was as individually characteristic as his face or his dress, or his way of talking or of writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Indeed, it seemed indispensable for the explanation of all of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I found in looking back upon my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interview with him, that all I had known of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00002.00023" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> through others, or through his own books, for <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>, had been utterly defective,--had left out, in fact, the key to his whole nature,--inasmuch as nobody had ever described to me his laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/></p> 
<p>It is impossible to follow the matter further without a little bit of personal narration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>On visiting <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, in <dateStruct value="1872--"><year reg="1872">1872</year></dateStruct>, I was offered a letter to <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00024" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, and declined it. Like all of my own generation, I had been under some personal obligations to him for his early writings,--though in my case this debt was trifling compared with that due to <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00025" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:3"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>,--but his <quote>Latter-day pamphlets</quote> and his reported utterances on American affairs had taken away all special desire to meet him, besides the ungraciousness said to mark his demeanor toward visitors from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Yet, when I was once fairly launched in that fascinating world of <orgName n="London Society" type="society">London society</orgName>, where the <rs>American</rs> sees, as <persName n="Willis,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00026" reg="mostcommon:Willis,nomatch:0"><surname>Willis</surname></persName> used to say, whole shelves of his library walking about in coats and gowns, this disinclination rapidly softened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>And when <persName n="Froude,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00027" reg="mostcommon:Froude,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Froude</surname></persName> kindly offered to take me with him for <num value="1">one</num> of his afternoon calls on <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00028" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, and further proposed that I should join them in their habitual walk through the parks, it was not in human nature &mdash; or at least in American nature --to resist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We accordingly went after lunch, <num value="1">one</num> day in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, to <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00029" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s modest house in <placeName reg="Chelsea, Greater London, England" key="tgn,4012680">Chelsea</placeName>, and found him in his study, reading &mdash; by a chance very appropriate for me &mdash; in <persName n="Weiss,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00030" reg="mostcommon:Weiss,nomatch:0"><surname>Weiss</surname></persName>'s <quote>Life of <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00004.00031" reg="mostcommon:Parker,Theodore,,,:5"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He received us kindly, but <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> at once began inveighing against the want of arrangement in the book he was reading, the defective grouping of the different parts, and the impossibility of finding anything in it, even by aid of the index.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He then went on to speak of <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00005.00032" reg="mostcommon:Parker,Theodore,,,:5"><surname>Parker</surname></persName> himself, and of other <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00005.00033" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> whom he had met. I do not recall the details of the conversation, but to my surprise he did not say a single really offensive or ungracious thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If he did, it related less to my countrymen than to his own, for I remember his saying some rather stern things about <persName n="Scotchmen,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00005.00034" reg="mostcommon:Scotchmen,nomatch:0"><surname>Scotchmen</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But that which saved these and all his sharpest words from being actually offensive was this, that, after the most vehement tirade, he would suddenly pause, throw his head back, and give as genuine and kindly a laugh as I ever heard from a human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was not the bitter laugh of the cynic, nor yet the big-bodied laugh of the burly joker; least of all was it the thin and rasping cackle of the dyspeptic satirist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was a broad, honest, human laugh, which, beginning in the brain, took into its action the whole heart and diaphragm, and instantly changed the worn face into something frank and even winning, giving to it an expression that would have won the confidence of any child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Nor did it convey the impression of an exceptional thing that had occurred for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that day and might <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> never happen again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Rather, it produced the effect of something habitual; of being the channel, well worn for years, by which the overflow of a strong nature was discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It cleared the air like thunder, and left the atmosphere sweet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It seemed to say to himself, if not to us, <quote>Do not let us take this too seriously; it is my way of putting things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>What refuge is there for a man who looks below the surface in a world like this, except to laugh now and then?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The laugh, in short, revealed the humorist; if I said the genial humorist, wearing a mask of grimness, I should hardly go too far for the impression it left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>At any rate, it shifted the ground, and transferred the whole matter to that realm of thought where men play with things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The instant <rs>Carlyle</rs> laughed, he seemed to take the counsel of his old friend <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00006.00035" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:3"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, and to write upon the lintels of his doorway, <quote>Whim.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Whether this interpretation be right or wrong, it is certain that the effect of this new point of view upon <num value="1">one</num> of his visitors was wholly disarming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The bitter and unlovely vision vanished; my armed neutrality went with it, and there I sat talking with <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00006.00036" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> as fearlessly as if he were an old friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The talk soon fell on the most dangerous of all ground, our Civil War, which was then near enough to inspire curiosity; and he put questions showing that he <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> had, after all, considered the matter in a sane and reasonable way. He was especially interested in the freed slaves and the colored troops; he said but little, yet that was always to the point, and without <num value="1">one</num> ungenerous word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>On the contrary, he showed more readiness to comprehend the situation, as it existed after the war, than was to be found in most Englishmen at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The need of giving the ballot to the former slaves he readily admitted, when it was explained to him; and he at once volunteered the remark that in a republic they needed this, as the guarantee of their freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><quote>You could do no less,</quote> he said, <quote>for the men who had stood by you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I could scarcely convince my senses that this manly and reasonable critic was the terrible <rs>Carlyle</rs>, the hater of <quote><persName n="Cuffee,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00007.00037" reg="mostcommon:Cuffee,nomatch:0"><surname>Cuffee</surname></persName></quote> and <quote>Quashee</quote> and of all republican government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>If at times a trace of angry exaggeration showed itself, the good, sunny laugh came in and cleared the air.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We walked beneath the lovely trees of Kensington Gardens, then in the glory of an <persName n="May,,English,,," id="n0215.0002.00007.00038" reg="default:May,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>May</surname></persName>; and I had my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight of the endless procession of riders and equipages in <placeName reg="Rotten Row">Rotten Row</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>My <num value="2">two</num> companions received numerous greetings, and as I walked in safe obscurity by their side, I could cast sly glances of keen enjoyment at the odd combination visible in their <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> looks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><persName n="Froude,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00008.00039" reg="mostcommon:Froude,nomatch:0"><surname>Froude</surname></persName>'s fine face and bearing became familiar afterwards to <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00008.00040" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and he was irreproachably dressed; while probably no salutation was ever bestowed from an elegant passing carriage on an odder figure than <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00008.00041" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Tall, very thin, and slightly stooping; with unkempt, grizzly whiskers pushed up by a high collar, and kept down by an ancient felt hat; wearing an old faded <rs n="frock coat" type="product">frock coat</rs>, checked waistcoat, coarse gray trousers, and russet shoes ; holding a stout stick, with his hands encased in very large gray woolen gloves,--this was <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00008.00042" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I noticed that, when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> left his house, his aspect attracted no notice in the streets, being doubtless familiar in his own neighborhood; but as we went farther and farther on, many eyes were turned in his direction, and men sometimes stopped to gaze at him. Little he noticed it, however, as he plodded along with his eyes cast down or looking straight before him, while his lips poured forth an endless stream of talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Once and once only he was accosted, and forced to answer; and I recall it with delight as showing how the unerring instinct of childhood coincided with mine, and pronounced him not a man to be feared.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We passed a spot where some nobleman's grounds were being appropriated for a public park; it was only lately that people had been <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> allowed to cross them, and all was in the rough, preparations for the change having been begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Part of the turf had been torn up for a roadway, but there was a little emerald strip where <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> ragged children, the oldest not over <num value="10">ten</num>, were turning somersaults in great delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>As we approached, they paused and looked shyly at us, as if uncertain of their right on these premises; and I could see the oldest, a sharp-eyed little <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> boy, reviewing us with <num value="1">one</num> keen glance, as if selecting him in whom confidence might best be placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Now I am myself a child-loving person; and I had seen with pleasure <persName n="Froude,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0002.00009.00043" reg="mostcommon:Froude,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Froude</surname></persName>'s kindly ways with his own youthful household: yet the little <hi rend="italics">gamin</hi> dismissed us with a glance and fastened on <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00009.00044" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Pausing on <num value="1">one</num> foot, as if ready to take to his heels on the least discouragement, he called out the daring question, <quote>I say, mister, may we roll on this here grass?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The philosopher faced round, leaning on his staff, and replied in a homelier Scotch accent than I had yet heard him use, <quote>Yes, my little fellow, r-r-roll at discraytion!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Instantly the children resumed their antics, while <num value="1">one</num> little girl repeated meditatively, <quote>He says we may roll at discraytion!</quote> --as if it were some new kind of ninepin-ball.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><measure n="6years" type="date">Six years</measure> later, I went with my friend <persName n="Conway,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00009.00045" reg="mostcommon:Conway,M.,D.,,:2"><surname>Conway</surname></persName> to call on <persName n="Carlyle,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0002.00009.00046" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> once more, and found the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> kindly laugh still there, though changed, like all else in him, by the advance of years and the solitude of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It could not be said of him that he grew old happily, but he did not grow old unkindly, I should say; it was painful to see him, but it was because <num value="1">one</num> pitied him, not by reason of resentment suggested by anything on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He announced himself to be, and he visibly was, a man left behind by time and waiting for death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He seemed in a manner sunk within himself; but I remember well the affectionate way in which he spoke of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00010.00047" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:3"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, who had just sent him the address entitled <quote>The future of the <rs>Republic</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00010.00048" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> remarked, <quote>I've just noo been reading it; the dear <rs>Emerson</rs>, he thinks the whole warrld's like himself; and if he can just get a <num value="1000000">million</num> people together and let them all vote, they'll be sure to vote right and all will go vara weel</quote> ; and then came in the brave laugh of old, but briefer and less hearty by reason of years and sorrows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><num value="1">One</num> may well hesitate before obtruding upon the public any such private impressions of an eminent man. They will always appear either too personal or too trivial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But I have waited in vain to see some justice done to the side of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00010.00049" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> here portrayed; and since it has been very commonly asserted that the effect he produced on strangers was that of a rude and offensive person, <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> it seems almost a duty to testify to the very different way in which <num value="1">one</num> American visitor saw him. An impression produced at <num value="2">two</num> interviews, <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> apart, may be worth recording, especially if it proved strong enough to outweigh all previous prejudice and antagonism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>In fine, I should be inclined to appeal from all <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0215.0002.00011.00050" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,I.,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s apparent bitterness and injustice to the mere quality of his laugh, as giving sufficient proof that the gift of humor underlay all else in him. All his critics, I now think, treat him a little too seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>No matter what his labors or his purposes, the attitude of the humorist was always behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Yet this is what, as students of poetry, we all instinctively wish to do. Rightly or wrongly, we long to trace the successive steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>To some extent, the same opportunity is given in successive editions of the printed work; but here the study is not so much of changes in the poet's own mind as of those produced by the criticisms, often dull or ignorant, of his readers,--those especially who fail to catch a poet's very finest thought, and persuade him to dilute it a little for their satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>When I pointed out to <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0215.0004.00024.00079" reg="mostcommon:Browning,nomatch:0"><surname>Browning</surname></persName> some rather unfortunate alterations in his later editions, and charged him with having made them to accommodate stupid people, he admitted the offense and promised to alter them back again, although, of course, he never did. But the changes in an author's manuscript almost always come either from his own finer perception and steady advance toward the precise conveyance of his own thought, or else from the aid he receives in this from some immediate friend or adviser-most likely a woman &mdash; who is in close sympathy with his own mood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The charm is greatest, of course, in seeing and studying and touching the original <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> page, just as it is. For this a photograph is the best substitute, since it preserves the original for the eye, as does the phonograph for the ear. Even with the aid of photography only, there is as much difference between the final corrected shape and the page showing the gradual changes, as between the graceful yacht lying in harbor, anchored, motionless, with sails furled, and the same yacht as a winged creature, gliding into port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Let us now see, by actual comparison, how <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0215.0004.00025.00080" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>'s yachts came in.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>To begin with, the title varies slightly from that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adopted, and reads simply <quote>On melancholy,</quote> to which the word <quote>Ode</quote> was later prefixed <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> by the printers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, where he had half written <quote>Henbane</quote> for the material of his incantation, he blots it out and puts <quote>Wolfsbane,</quote> instantly abandoning the tamer suggestion and bringing in all the wildness and the superstition that have gathered for years around the Loup-garou and the Wehr-wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>This is plainly no amendment suggested afterward by another person, but is due unmistakably to the quick action of his own mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>There is no other change until the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stanza, where the last <num value="2">two</num> lines were originally written thus:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/></p><l>For shade to shade will come too heavily</l> <l>And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul.</l></quote> It is noticeable that he originally wrote <quote>down</quote> for <quote>drown,</quote> and, in afterward inserting the r, put it in the wrong place &mdash; after the <hi rend="italics">o</hi>, instead of before it. This was a slip of the pen only; but it was that word <quote>heavily</quote> which cost him a struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The words <quote>too heavily</quote> were next crossed out, and under them were written <quote>too sleepily</quote> ; then this last word was again erased, and the word <quote>drowsily</quote> was finally substituted &mdash; the only expression in the <rs>English</rs> language, perhaps, which could have precisely indicated the exact shade of debilitating languor he meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/><pb id="p.27" n="27"/></p> 
<p>In the other stanza, it is noticeable that he spells <quote>melancholy,</quote> through heedlessness, <quote>melanancholy,</quote> which gives a curious effect of prolonging and deepening the incantation; and this error he does not discover or correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>In the same way he spells <quote>fit,</quote> <quote>fitt,</quote> having perhaps in mind the <quote>fytte</quote> of the earlier poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>These are trifles, but when he alters the line, which originally stood,--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><quote> But when the melancholy fit shall come,</quote> and for <quote>come</quote> substitutes <quote>fall,</quote> we see at once, besides the merit of the soft alliteration, that he gives more of the effect of doom and suddenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/><quote>Come</quote> was clearly too business like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Afterwards, instead of--</p> 
<p rend="rend=center">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> <quote>Then feed thy sorrow on a morning rose,</quote> he substitutes for <quote>feed</quote> the inexpressibly more effective word <quote>glut,</quote> which gives at once the exhaustive sense of wealth belonging so often to <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0215.0004.00027.00086" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>'s poetry, and seems to match the full ecstasy of color and shape and fragrance that a morning rose may hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Finally, in the line which originally stood,--</p> 
<p rend="rend=center">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> <quote>Or on the rainbow of the dashing wave,</quote> he strikes out the rather trite epithet <quote>dashing,</quote> and substitutes the stronger phrase <quote>salts-and wave,</quote> which is peculiar to him. <pb id="p.28" n="28"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>All these changes are happily accepted in the common editions of <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0215.0004.00028.00087" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName>; but these editions make <num value="2">two</num> errors that are corrected by this manuscript, and should henceforth be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>In the line usually printed,--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/><quote>Nor let the beetle, nor the death-moth be,</quote> the autograph text gives <quote>or</quote> in the place of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <quote>nor,</quote> a change consonant with the best usage; and in the line,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/><quote>And hides the green hill in an April shroud,</quote> the middle word is clearly not <quote>hill,</quote> but <quote>hills.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>This is a distinct improvement, both because it broadens the landscape and because it averts the jangle of the closing <hi rend="italics">ll</hi> with the final words <quote>fall</quote> and <quote>all</quote> in previous lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It is a fortunate thing that, in the uncertain destiny of all literary manuscripts, this characteristic document should have been preserved for us. It will be remembered that <persName n="Keats,,,,," id="n0215.0004.00028.00088" reg="nearbymention:Keats,George,,,"><surname>Keats</surname></persName> himself once wrote in a letter that his fondest prayer, next to that for the health of his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, would be that some child of his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> <quote>should be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> American poet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>But he matured and mellowed well; his social life at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was more satisfactory to himself and others than that he led in New York; he had voluntarily transplanted himself to a community which, with all its faults and crudities, sets intellect above wealth, and readily conceded the highest place to a man like <persName n="Bancroft,,,,," id="n0215.0010.00107.00521" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>His merits are obvious enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>He had great enthusiasm for his subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>He was profoundly imbued with that democratic spirit without which the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> cannot be justly written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Add to this the capacity for occasional maxims to the highest degree profound and lucid, in the way of political philosophy, and you certainly combine in <num value="1">one</num> man some of the greatest qualities of the historian.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Against this are to be set very grave faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>In his earlier editions there was an habitual pomposity and inflation of style which the sterner taste of his later years has so modified that we must now condone it. The same heroic revision has cut off many tame and commonplace remarks as trite as those virtuous truisms by which <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate actors bring down the applause of the galleries at cheap theatres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Many needless philosophical digressions have shared the same fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>But many faults remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>There is, in the first place, that error so common with the graphic school of historians,--the exaggerated estimate of manuscript or fragmentary material at the expense of what is printed and permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>In many departments of history this dependence is inevitable; but, unfortunately, <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00110.00529" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName> was not, except in the very earliest volumes of his history, dealing with such departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The loose and mythical period of our history really ends with <persName n="John,Captain,,,," id="n0215.0010.00110.00530" reg="mostcommon:John,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>John</surname></persName> <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0215.0010.00111.00531" reg="mostcommon:Smith,Adam,,,:1"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>From the moment when the <name>Pilgrims</name> landed, the main facts of American history are to be found recorded in a series of carefully prepared documents, made by men to whom the pen was familiar, and who were exceedingly methodical in all their ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>The same is true of all the struggles which led to the <name>Revolution</name>, and of all those which followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>They were the work of honest-minded Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0215.0010.00111.00532" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> men who, if they issued so much as a street hand-bill, said just what they meant, and meant precisely what they said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>To fill the gaps in this solid documentary chain is, no doubt, desirable,--to fill them by every passing rumor, every suggestion of a French agent's busy brain; but to substitute this inferior matter for the firmer basis is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>Much of the graphic quality of <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00111.00533" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>'s writing is obtained by this means, and this portends, in certain directions, a future shrinkage and diminution in his fame.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>An accurate historian would no more have issued such a restatement under the shelter of quotation-marks than an accurate theologian would have rewritten the <num value="10">Ten</num> Commandments and read his improved edition from the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>And it is a curious fact that while <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00114.00550" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName> has amended so much else in his later editions, he has left this passage untouched, and still implies an adherence to the tradition that this is the way to write history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>It is also to be noted that the evil is doubled when this practice is combined with the other habit, already mentioned, of relying largely upon manuscript authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>If an historian garbles, paraphrases, and rearranges when he is dealing with matter accessible to all, how much greater the peril when he is dealing with what is in written documents held under his own lock and key. It is not necessary to allege intentional perversion, but we are, at the very least, absolutely at the mercy of an inaccurate habit of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The importance of this point is directly manifested on opening the leaves of <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00115.00551" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>'s last and perhaps most valuable book, <quote>The history of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>The most important part of this book consists, by concession of all, in the vast mass of selections from the private correspondence of the period: for instance, of <persName n="Otto,,M.,,," id="n0215.0010.00115.00552" reg="default:Otto,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Otto</surname></persName>, the <rs>French Ambassador</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>We do not hesitate to say that, if tried by the standard of <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00115.00553" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>'s previous literary methods, this mass of correspondence, though valuable as suggestion, is worthless as authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Until it has been carefully collated and compared with the originals, we do not know that a paragraph or a sentence of it is left as the author wrote it; the system of paraphrase previously exhibited throws the shadow of doubt over all. No person can safely cite <num value="1">one</num> of these letters in testimony; no person knows whether any particular statement contained in it comes to us in the words of its supposed author or of <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00115.00554" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>It is no answer to say that this loose method was the method of certain <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> historians; if <persName n="Thucydides,,,,," id="n0215.0010.00115.00555" reg="mostcommon:Thucydides,nomatch:0"><surname>Thucydides</surname></persName> composed speeches for his heroes, it was at least known that he prepared them, and there was not the standing falsehood of a quotation-mark.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>A drawback quite as serious is to be found in this, that <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00115.00556" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>'s extraordinary labors in old age were not usually devoted to revising the grounds of his own earlier judgments, but <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> to perfecting his own style of expression, and to weaving in additional facts at those points which especially interested him. <persName n="Agassiz,Professor,,,," id="n0215.0010.00116.00557" reg="mostcommon:Agassiz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> used to say that the greatest labor of the student of biology came from the enormous difficulty of keeping up with current publications and the proceedings of societies; a man could carry on his own observations, but he could not venture to publish them without knowing all the latest statements made by other observers.

Absorbed in his own great stores of material, he often let the work of others go unobserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>It would be easy to multiply instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Thus, the controversies about <persName n="Verrazzano,,,,," id="n0215.0010.00116.00559" reg="mostcommon:Verrazzano,nomatch:0"><surname>Verrazzano</surname></persName>'s explorations were conveniently settled by omitting his name altogether; there was no revision of the brief early statement that the <name>Norse</name> sagas were <quote>mythological,</quote> certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the least appropriate adjectives that could have been selected; <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0215.0010.00116.00560" reg="nearbymention:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName> never even read &mdash; up to within a few years of his death, at any rate &mdash; the important monographs of <persName><foreName>Varnhagen</foreName></persName> in respect to Amerigo Vespucci; he did not keep up with the publications of the historical societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The consequence is that much light has been let in upon American history in directions where he has not so much as a window; and there are points where his knowledge, vast as it is, will be found to have been already superseded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>In this view, that cannot be asserted of him which the late <name>English</name> historian, <persName n="Green,Mister,J.,R.,," id="n0215.0010.00117.00561" reg="default:Green,J.,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>, proudly and justly claimed for himself: <quote>I know what men will say of me &mdash; he died learning.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>There was in him, at an earlier period, a certain amount of visible self-will, and a certain impatience with those who dissented from him,--he would not have been his father's son had it been otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>It must be remembered that the expression of such opinions to-day, when all his charges against the actual Church may be found similarly stated by bishops and doctors of divinity, must have produced a very different impression when <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> made <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago by a man of <num value="40">forty</num> or thereabouts, who occupied <num value="20">twenty</num> pages in saying it, and rested in closing upon the calm basis, <quote>The true worship of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> consists in the service of his children and devotion to the common interests of men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>It may be that he who wrote these words never held a regular pew in any church or identified himself, on the other hand, with any public heretical organization, even <num value="1">one</num> so moderate as the <rs>Free Religious Association</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Yet the fact that he devoted his <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> afternoons for many years to talking and Scripture reading in a Hospital for Incurables conducted by Roman Catholics perhaps showed that it was safer to leave such a man to go on his own course and reach the kingdom of heaven in his own way,</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>He had strokes of genius, sometimes with unsatisfying results; yet failures never stood in his way, but seemed to drop from his memory in a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>An unsurpassable <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> model in most respects, there were limitations which made him in some minor ways a less trustworthy example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>He was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> son of a large family of sons and daughters, his parents being <persName><foreName>Nathan</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Preston,,Sarah,,," id="n0215.0013.00160.00732" reg="default:Preston,Sarah,,,"><foreName>Sarah</foreName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName> (<persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00160.00733" reg="mostcommon:Everett,Edward,,,:6"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>) <persName n="Hale,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00160.00734" reg="nearbymention:Hale,Edward,Everett,,"><surname>Hale</surname></persName>, and he was born in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1822-04-03"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="3">3</day>, <year reg="1822">1822</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>His father was the editor of the leading newspaper in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, the <quote><orgName n="Daily Advertiser" type="newspaper">Daily Advertiser</orgName>,</quote> and most of his children developed, in <num value="1">one</num> way or another, distinct literary tastes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>The subject of this sketch had before him, as a literary example and influence, the celebrated statesman and orator whose name he bore, and who was his mother's brother.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>My own recollections of him begin quite early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Nearly <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> younger than he, I was, like him, the youngest of my <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> class, which was <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later than his. My college remembrances of him are vivid and characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Living outside of the college yard, I was sometimes very nearly late for morning prayers; and more than once on such occasions, as I passed beneath the walls of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00160.00735" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>, then a dormitory, there would spring from the doorway a tall, slim young student who had, according to current report among the freshmen, sprung out of bed almost at the last stroke of the bell, thrown his clothes over <pb id="p.161" n="161"/> the stairway, and jumped into them on the way down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>This was <persName n="Hale,,Edward,Everett,," id="n0215.0013.00161.00736" reg="default:Hale,Edward,Everett,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <foreName>Everett</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName>; and this early vision was brought to my mind not infrequently in later life by his way of doing maturer things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The same qualities which marked his personal appearance marked his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>He was always ready for action, never stopped for trifles, always lacked but little of being <num value="1">one</num> of the heroes or men of genius of his time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>Nor can any <num value="1">one</num> yet predict which of these will be the form finally taken by his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>His capacity for work was unlimited, and he perhaps belonged to more societies and committees than any man living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>In this field his exhaustless energy had play, but his impetuous temperament often proved a drawback, and brought upon him the criticism of men of less talent but more accurate habits of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>No denominational barriers existed for him. Ready to officiate in all pulpits and welcome in all, he left it unknown to the end of his life whether he did or did not believe in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> miracles, for instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Nor did anybody who talked with him care much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>His peculiar and attractive personality made him acceptable to all sorts of people and to men of all creeds; for his extraordinary versatility enabled him in his intercourse with other minds to adapt his sympathy and his language to the <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> individual modes of thought and belief of each and all of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Some of his finest literary achievements were those which he himself had forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>Up to the last degree prolific, he left more than <num value="1">one</num> absolutely triumphant stroke behind him in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>The best bit of prose that I can possibly associate with him was a sketch in a newspaper bearing the somewhat meaningless title <quote>The last shake,</quote> suggested by watching the withdrawal of the last man with a hand-cart who was ever allowed to shake carpets on Boston Common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>He was, no doubt, a dusty and forlorn figure enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>But to <persName n="Hale,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00162.00737" reg="nearbymention:Hale,Edward,Everett,,"><surname>Hale</surname></persName>'s ready imagination he stood for a whole epoch of history, for the long procession of carpet-shakers who were doing their duty there when <persName n="Percy,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00162.00738" reg="mostcommon:Percy,nomatch:0"><surname>Percy</surname></persName> marched to <placeName reg="Lexington, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013888">Lexington</placeName>, or when the cannonade from <placeName reg="Breeds Hill, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2193272">Breed's Hill</placeName> was in the air. <rs type="season">Summer</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> had come and gone, sons had succeeded their fathers at their work, and the beating of the carpets had gone on, undrowned by the rising city's roar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>At last the more fastidious aldermen rebelled, the last shake was given, and <persName n="Hale,,Edward,Everett,," id="n0215.0013.00162.00739" reg="default:Hale,Edward,Everett,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <foreName>Everett</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName> wrote its elegy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>I suppose I kept the little newspaper cutting on my desk for <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, as a model of what wit and sympathy could extract from the humblest theme.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Another stroke was of quite a different character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/><pb id="p.163" n="163"/> Out of the myriad translations of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00163.00740" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, there is in all <name>English</name> literature but <num value="1">one</num> version known to me of even a single passage which gives in a high degree the <name>Homeric</name> flavor.

Had it not been printed by us there, it might, sooner or later, have found its way into that still unpublished magazine which <persName n="Hale,,,,," id="n0215.0013.00163.00745" reg="nearbymention:Hale,Edward,Everett,,"><surname>Hale</surname></persName> and I planned together, when we lived near each other in <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester, Massachusetts</placeName>,--a periodical which was to have been called the <quote>Unfortunates' magazine,</quote> and was to contain all the prose and verse sent to us by neighbors or strangers with request to get it published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>I remember that we made out a title-page between us, with a table of contents, all genuine, for the imaginary <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>He believed, for instance, that the school hours of a city should be very much shortened, yet never made it clear what pursuits should take their places; for it was the habit of his fertile brain to formulate <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> schemes and allow others to work them out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>There were times when he chafed under what seemed to him a non-military work and longed for the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>It is perhaps characteristic of his temperament, however, that at the outset he preferred to be where the greatest obstacles were to be encountered, and this he certainly achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>They had also to encounter for a long time the disapproval of many officers of high rank in the <rs>Union</rs> army, both regular and volunteer, this often leading to a grudging bestowal of supplies (especially, strange to say, of medical ones), and to a disproportionate share of fatigue duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>This was hard indeed for <persName n="Saxton,,,,," id="n0215.0014.00179.00792" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Rufus,,,"><surname>Saxton</surname></persName> to bear, and was increased in his case by the fact that he had been almost the only cadet in his time at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> who was strong in anti-slavery feeling, and who thus began with antagonisms which lasted into actual <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>As all men in that day knew, there was a formidable variation in this respect in different regiments, some of the volunteer officers whose military standard was the highest being the lowest in their personal habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Much of her amiability took the form of flattery,--a flattery so habitual that it lost all its grossness, and became almost a form of good deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>She was sometimes justly accused of applying this to the wealthy and influential, but it was almost as freely exercised where she had nothing to gain by it; and it gave to the humblest the feeling that he was at least worth flattering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>From an early period of life he was a profuse <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> and vigorous pamphleteer, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pamphlet being published during the <rs>Civil War</rs> and entitled <quote>Cheap Cotton by free labor,</quote> and this publication led to his acquaintance with <persName n="Wells,,David,R.,," id="n0215.0018.00217.00910" reg="default:Wells,David,R.,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Wells</surname></persName> and <persName n="Nordhoff,,Charles,,," id="n0215.0018.00217.00911" reg="default:Nordhoff,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Nordhoff</surname></persName>, thenceforth his life-long friends.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>A large part of his attention from <dateStruct value="1889--"><year reg="1889">1889</year></dateStruct> onward was occupied by experiments in cooking and diet, culminating in an invention of his own called <quote>The Aladdin Oven.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>This led him into investigations as to the cost of nutrition in different countries, on which subject he also wrote pamphlets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>He soon was led into experiments so daring that he claimed to have proved it possible to cook with it, in open air, a <num value="5">five</num>-course dinner for <num value="10">ten</num> persons, and gave illustrations of this at outdoor entertainments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>He claimed that good nutrition could be had for $ per week, and that a family of <num value="5">five</num>, by moderate management, could be comfortably supported on $i <num value="80">80</num> per year (<orgName n="Boston Herald" type="newspaper">Boston <name>Herald</name></orgName>, <dateStruct value="1891-10-08"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="8">8</day>, <year reg="1891">1891</year></dateStruct>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>I can only say for <num value="1">one</num>, that if the meals at that price were like a dinner of which I partook at his own house with an invited party, and at which I went through the promised <num value="5">five</num> courses after seeing them all prepared in the garden, I think that his standard of poverty came very near to luxury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>Mingled with these things in later years was introduced another valuable department of instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>He was more and more called upon to give addresses, especially on manufactures, before Southern audiences, and there was no disposition to criticise him for his anti-slavery record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>Another man could hardly be found whose knowledge of manufacturing and of insurance combined made him so fit to give counsel in the new business impulse showing itself at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>Almost everything he left is the talk of a specially trained man to a limited audience, also well trained,--at least in the particular department to which he addresses himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>The men to whom he talks may not know how to read or write, but they are all practically versed in the subjects of which he treats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>He talks as a miner to miners, a farmer to farmers, a cook to cooks ; but among all of his papers which I have examined, that in which he appears to the greatest advantage to the general reader is his <quote>Address before the <name>Alumni</name> of <orgName n="Andover Theological Seminary" type="seminary">Andover Theological Seminary</orgName></quote> on <dateStruct value="1886-06-09"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="9">9</day>, <year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>Here he speaks as <num value="1">one</num> representing a wholly different pursuit from that of his auditors; a layman to clergymen, or those aiming to become so. He says to them frankly at the outset, <quote>I have often thought [at church] that if a member of the congregation could sometimes occupy the pulpit while the minister took his place in the pew, it might be a benefit to both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>His outward life, on the whole, seemed much akin to the lives led by that considerable class of <name>English</name> gentlemen who adopt no profession, dwelling mainly on their paternal estates, yet are neither politicians nor fox-hunters; pursuing their own favorite studies, taking part from time to time in the pursuits of science, art, or literature, even holding minor public functions, but winning no widespread fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>The lines which formed a prelude to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume of her poems are the only ones that have yet come to light which indicate even a temporary desire to come in contact with the great world of readers; for she seems to have had no reference, in all the rest, to anything but her own thought and a few friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>But for her only sister, it is very doubtful if her poems would ever have been printed at all; and when published, they were launched quietly and without any expectation of a wide audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>Yet the outcome of it was that <num value="6">six</num> editions of the volume were sold within <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, a suddenness of success almost without a parallel in American literature.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/><pb id="p.250" n="250"/></p> 
<p>The mind is so near itself it cannot see distinctly, and I have none to ask.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>Should you think it breathed, and had you the leisure to tell me, I should feel quick gratitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>If I make the mistake, that you dared to tell me would give me sincerer honor toward you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>I inclose my name, asking you, if you please, sir, to tell me what is true?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>That you will not betray me it is needless to ask, since honor is its own pawn.</p></body></text> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>The letter was postmarked <quote><orgName type="college" n="Amherst college">Amherst</orgName>,</quote> and it was in a handwriting so peculiar that it seemed as if the writer might.have taken her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons by studying the famous fossil bird-tracks in the museum of that college town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>Yet it was not in the slightest degree illiterate, but cultivated, quaint, and wholly unique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>Of punctuation there was little; she used chiefly dashes, and it has been thought better, in printing these letters, as with her poems, to give them the benefit in this respect of the ordinary usages; and so with her habit as to capitalization, as the printers call it, in which she followed the Old English and present <name>German</name> method of thus distinguishing every noun substantive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>But the most curious thing about the letter was the total absence of a signature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>It proved, however, that she had written her name on a card, and put it under the shelter of a smaller <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> envelope inclosed in the larger; and even this name was written &mdash; as if the shy writer wished to recede as far as possible from view --in pencil, not in ink. The name was <persName n="Emily Dickinson,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00251.01049" reg="mostcommon:Emily Dickinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emily Dickinson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>Inclosed with the letter were <num value="4">four</num> poems, <num value="2">two</num> of which have since been separately printed,--<quote>Safe in their alabaster chambers</quote> and <quote>I'll tell you how the sun rose,</quote> besides the <num value="2">two</num> that here follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> comprises in its <num value="8">eight</num> lines a truth so searching that it seems a condensed summary of the whole experience of a long life:--<quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="stanza"><l>We play at paste</l> <l>Till qualified for pearl;</l> <l>Then drop the paste</l> <l>And deem ourself a fool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Then came <num value="1">one</num> which I have always classed among the most exquisite of her productions, with a singular felicity of phrase and an aerial lift that bears the ear upward with the bee it traces:--<quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="stanza"><l>The nearest dream recedes unrealized.</l> <l>The heaven we chase,</l> <l>Like the <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> bee <pb id="p.252" n="252"/></l> <l>Before the schoolboy,</l> <l>Invites the race,</l> <l>Stoops to an easy clover,</l> <l>Dips &mdash; evades &mdash; teases &mdash; deploys--</l> <l>Then to the royal clouds</l> <l>Lifts his light pinnace,</l> <l>Heedless of the boy</l> <l>Staring, bewildered, at the mocking sky. </l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>Homesick for steadfast honey,--</l> <l>Ah!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>The impression of a wholly new and original poetic genius was as distinct on my mind at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reading of these <num value="4">four</num> poems as it is now, after half a century of further knowledge; and with it came the problem never yet solved, what place ought to be assigned in literature to what is so remarkable, yet so elusive of criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>The bee himself did not evade the schoolboy more than she evaded me; and even at this day I still stand somewhat bewildered, like the boy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>Circumstances, however, soon brought me in contact with an uncle of <persName n="Emily Dickinson,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00252.01050" reg="mostcommon:Emily Dickinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emily Dickinson</surname></persName>, a gentleman not now living: a prominent citizen of <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester, Massachusetts</placeName>, a man of integrity and character, who shared her abruptness and impulsiveness, but certainly not her poetic temperament, from which he was indeed singularly <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> remote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>He could tell but little of her, she being evidently an enigma to him, as to me. It is hard to say what answer was made by me, under these circumstances, to this letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>It is probable that the adviser sought to gain time a little and find out with what strange creature he was dealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>I remember to have ventured on some criticism which she afterwards called <quote>surgery,</quote> and on some questions, part of which she evaded, as will be seen, with a naive skill such as the most experienced and worldly coquette might envy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>Her <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> letter (received <dateStruct value="1862-04-26"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="26">26</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) was as follows:--

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>It is, however, needless to conceal that many of her brilliant fragments were less satisfying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>She almost always grasped whatever she sought, but with some fracture of grammar and dictionary on the way. Often, too, she was obscure, and sometimes inscrutable; and though obscurity is sometimes, in <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00268.01069" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>'s phrase, a compliment to the reader, yet it is never safe to press this compliment too hard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>Sometimes, on the other hand, her verses found too much favor for her comfort, and she <pb id="p.269" n="269"/> was urged to publish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>In such cases I was sometimes put forward as a defense; and the following letter was the fruit of some such occasion:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>I said I was incapable, and she seemed not to believe me and asked me not to decide for a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>Meantime, she would write me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>Dear friend,--A letter always feels to me like immortality because it is the mind alone without corporeal friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>Indebted in our talk to attitude and accent, there seems a spectral power in thought that walks alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>I would like to thank you for your great kindness, but never try to lift the words which I cannot hold.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>At last, after many postponements, on <dateStruct value="1870-08-16"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>, I found myself face to face with my hitherto unseen correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>It was at her father's house, <num value="1">one</num> of those large, square, brick mansions so familiar in our older <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> towns, surrounded by trees and blossoming shrubs without, and within exquisitely neat, cool, spacious, and fragrant with flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>After a little delay, I heard an extremely faint and pattering footstep like that of a child, in the hall, and in glided, almost noiselessly, a plain, shy little person, the face without a single good feature, but with eyes, as she herself said, <quote>like the sherry the guest leaves in the glass,</quote> and with smooth bands of reddish chestnut hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>She had a quaint and nun-like look, as if she might be a German canoness of some religious order, whose prescribed garb was white pique, with a blue net worsted shawl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>She came toward me with <num value="2">two</num> day-lilies, which she put in a childlike way into my hand, saying softly, under her breath, <quote>These are my introduction,</quote> and adding, also under her breath, in childlike fashion, <quote>Forgive me if I am frightened; I never see strangers, and hardly know what I say.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>But soon she began to talk, and thenceforward continued <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> almost constantly; pausing sometimes to beg that I would talk instead, bet readily recommencing when I evaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>There was not a trace of affectation in all this; she seemed to speak absolutely for her own relief, and wholly without watching its effect on her hearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>Led on by me, she told much about her early life, in which her father was always the chief figure, --evidently a man of the old type, <foreign lang="fr">la vieille roche</foreign> of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>,--a man who, as she said, read on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <quote>lonely and rigorous books</quote> ; and who had from childhood inspired her with such awe, that she never learned to tell time by the clock till she was <num value="15">fifteen</num>, simply because he had tried to explain it to her when she was a little child, and she had been afraid to tell him that she did not understand, and also afraid to ask any <num value="1">one</num> else lest he should hear of it. Yet she had never heard him speak a harsh word, and it needed only a glance at his photograph to see how truly the <rs>Puritan</rs> tradition was preserved in him. He did not wish his children, when little, to read anything but the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>; and when, <num value="1">one</num> day, her brother brought her home <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00273.01074" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,Samuel,,,:2"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s <quote><persName n="Kavanagh,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00273.01075" reg="mostcommon:Kavanagh,nomatch:0"><surname>Kavanagh</surname></persName>,</quote> he put it secretly under the pianoforte cover, made signs to her, and they both afterwards read it. It may have been before this, however, that a student of her father's was amazed to find that she and her <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> brother had never heard of <persName n="Child,,Lydia,Maria,," id="n0215.0020.00274.01076" reg="default:Child,Lydia,Maria,,"><foreName>Lydia</foreName> <foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>, then much read, and he brought <quote>Letters from New York,</quote> and hid it in the great bush of old-fashioned tree-box beside the front door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book, she thought in ecstasy, <quote>This, then, is a book, and there are more of them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>But she did not find so many as she expected, for she afterwards said to me, <quote>When I lost the use of my eyes, it was a comfort to think that there were so few real books that I could easily find <num value="1">one</num> to read me all of them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>Afterwards, when she regained her eyes, she read <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00274.01077" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, and thought to herself, <quote>Why is any other book needed?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>She went on talking constantly and saying, in the midst of narrative, things quaint and aphoristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/><quote>Is it oblivion or absorption when things pass from our minds?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/><quote>Truth is such a rare thing, it is delightful to tell it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/><quote>I find ecstasy in living; the mere sense of living is joy enough.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>When I asked her if she never felt any want of employment, not going off the grounds and rarely seeing a visitor, she answered, <quote>I never thought of conceiving that I could ever have the slightest approach to such a want in all future time</quote> ; and then added, after a pause, <quote>I feel that I have not expressed myself strongly enough,</quote> although it seemed to me that she had. She told me of her household <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> occupations, that she made all their bread, because her father liked only hers; then saying shyly, <quote>And people must have puddings,</quote> this very timidly and suggestively, as if they were meteors or comets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>Interspersed with these confidences came phrases so emphasized as to seem the very wantonness of over-statement, as if she pleased herself with putting into words what the most extravagant might possibly think without saying, as thus : <quote>How do most people live without any thoughts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>There are many people in the world,--you must have noticed them in the street,--how do they live?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>How do they get strength to put on their clothes in the morning?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>Or this crowning extravaganza: <quote>If I read a book and it makes my whole body so cold no fire can ever warm me, I know that is poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>These are the only ways I know it. Is there any other way?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>I have tried to describe her just as she was, with the aid of notes taken at the time; but this interview left our relation very much what it was before ;--on my side an interest that was strong and even affectionate, but not based on any thorough comprehension; and on her side a hope, always rather baffled, that I should afford some aid in solving her abstruse problem of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/><pb id="p.276" n="276"/></p> 
<p>The impression undoubtedly made on me was that of an excess of tension, and of something abnormal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>Perhaps in time I could have got beyond that somewhat overstrained relation which not my will, but her needs, had forced upon us. Certainly I should have been most glad to bring it down to the level of simple truth and every-day comradeship; but it was not altogether easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>She was much too enigmatical a being for me to solve in an hour's interview, and an instinct told me that the slightest attempt at direct cross-examination would make her withdraw into her shell; I could only sit still and watch, as <num value="1">one</num> does in the woods; I must name my bird without a gun, as recommended by <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0215.0020.00276.01078" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:3"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>When I said, at parting, that I would come again some time, she replied, <quote>Say, in a long time; that will be nearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Some time is no time.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>We met only once again, and I have no express record of the visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>We corresponded for years, at long intervals, her side of the intercourse being, I fear, better sustained; and she sometimes wrote also to my wife, inclosing flowers or fragrant leaves with a verse or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>Once she sent her <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Eliot,,George,,," id="n0215.0020.00277.01083" reg="default:Eliot,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>'s books, I think <quote>Middlemarch,</quote> and wrote, <quote>I am bringing you a little granite book for you to lean upon.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>After this added bereavement the inward life of the diminished household became only more <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> concentrated, and the world was held farther and farther away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Yet to this period belongs the following letter, written about <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, which has more of what is commonly called the objective or external quality than any she ever wrote me; and shows how close might have been her observation and her sympathy, had her rare qualities taken a somewhat different channel:--

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>dear friend,--I was touchingly reminded of [a child who had died] this morning by an Indian woman with gay baskets and a dazzling baby, at the kitchen door.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>She lived to refute much early criticism or hasty judgment, and this partly from inward growth, partly because the society in which she moved was growing for itself and understood her better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>The wife of a reformer is apt to be tested by the obstacles her husband encounters; if she is sympathetic, she shares his <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> difficulties, and if not, is perhaps criticised by the very same people for not sharing his zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/><persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0215.0021.00288.01093" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Julia,Ward,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>, moreover, came to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> at a time when all New Yorkers were there regarded with a slight distrust; she bore and reared <num value="5">five</num> children, and doubtless, like all good mothers, had methods of her own; she went into company, and was criticised by cliques which did not applaud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>Whatever she did, she might be in many eyes the object of prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Beyond all, there was, I suspect, a slight uncertainty in her own mind that was reflected in her early poems.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>From the moment when she came forward in the <rs>Woman Suffrage Movement</rs>, however, there was a visible change; it gave a new brightness to her face, a new cordiality in her manner, made her calmer, firmer; she found herself among new friends and could disregard old critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>Nothing can be more frank and characteristic than her own narrative of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> almost accidental participation in a woman's suffrage meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>She had strayed into the hall, still not half convinced, and was rather reluctantly persuaded to take a seat on the platform, although some of her best friends were there,--<persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0215.0021.00288.01094" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,Wendell,P.,,:1"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0215.0021.00288.01095" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,Wendell,,,:3"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Clarke,,James,Freeman,," id="n0215.0021.00288.01096" reg="default:Clarke,James,Freeman,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Freeman</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>, her pastor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>But there was also <persName n="Stone,,Lucy,,," id="n0215.0021.00288.01097" reg="default:Stone,Lucy,,,"><foreName>Lucy</foreName> <surname>Stone</surname></persName>, who had long been the object of imaginary <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> disapproval; and yet <persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0215.0021.00289.01098" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Julia,Ward,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>, like every <num value="1">one</num> else who heard <persName n="Stone,,Lucy,,," id="n0215.0021.00289.01099" reg="default:Stone,Lucy,,,"><foreName>Lucy</foreName> <surname>Stone</surname></persName>'s sweet voice for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, was charmed and half won by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>Such was the influence of that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting on <persName n="Howe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0215.0021.00289.01101" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Julia,Ward,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>. <quote>When they requested me to speak,</quote> she says, <quote>I could only say, I am with you. I have been with them ever since, and have never seen any reason to go back from the pledge then given.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>She adds that she had everything to learn with respect to public speaking, the rules of debate, and the management of her voice, she having hitherto spoken in parlors only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>In the same way she was gradually led into the wider sphere of women's congresses, and at last into the presidency of the woman's department at the great <rs>World</rs>'s Fair at New Orleans, in the winter of <dateStruct value="1883--"><year reg="1883">1883</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1884--"><year reg="1884">84</year></dateStruct>, at which she presided with great ability, organizing a series of short talks on the exhibits, to be given by experts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>While in charge of this, she held a special meeting in the colored people's department, where the <quote>Battle hymn</quote> was <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> sung, and she spoke to them of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0215.0021.00290.01102" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,Wendell,P.,,:1"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0215.0021.00290.01103" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,Charles,,,:1"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Howe,Doctor,,,," id="n0215.0021.00290.01104" reg="nearbymention:Howe,Julia,Ward,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Her daughter's collection of books written by women was presented to the <rs>Ladies</rs>' Art <orgName n="New Orleans Association" type="association">Association of New Orleans</orgName>, and her whole enterprise was a singular triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>In dealing with public enterprises in all parts of the country she soon made herself welcome everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>And yet this was the very woman who had written in the <quote>Salutatory</quote> of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume of poems:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/></p><l>I was born &apos;neath a clouded star,</l> <l>More in shadow than light have grown;</l> <l>Loving souls are not like trees</l> <l>That strongest and stateliest shoot alone.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>The truth is, that the life of a reformer always affords some training; either giving it self-control or marring it altogether,--more frequently the former; it was at any rate eminently so with her. It could be truly said, in her case, that to have taken up reform was a liberal education.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>Added to this was the fact that as her children grew, they filled and educated the domestic side of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/><num value="1">One</num> of her most attractive poems is that in which she describes herself as going out for exercise on a rainy day and walking round her house, looking up each time at the window where her children were watching <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> with merry eagerness for the successive glimpses of her. This is the poem I mean:--

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>I remember well that household of young people in successive summers at <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName>, as <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> they grew towards maturity; how they in turn came back from school and college, each with individual tastes and gifts, full of life, singing, dancing, reciting, poetizing, and <num value="1">one</num> of them, at least, with a talent for cookery which delighted all <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName>; then their wooings and marriages, always happy; their lives always busy; their temperaments so varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>These are the influences under which <quote>wild erratic natures</quote> grow calm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>A fine training it was also, for these children themselves, to see their mother <num value="1">one</num> of the few who could unite all kinds of friendship in the same life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Having herself the <hi rend="italics">entree</hi> of whatever the fashion of <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName> could in those days afford; entertaining brilliant or showy guests from New York, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040685">Paris</placeName>; her doors were as readily open at the same time to the plainest or most modest reformer-abolitionist, woman suffragist, or <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName>; and this as a matter of course, without struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>I remember the indignation over this of a young visitor from <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of her own kindred, who was in early girlhood so independently un-American that she came to this country only through defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Her brother had said to her after <num value="1">one</num> of her tirades, <quote>Why do you not go there and see for yourself?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>She responded, <quote>So I will,</quote> and sailed the next week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>Once arrived, she <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> antagonized everything, and I went in <num value="1">one</num> day and found her reclining in a great armchair, literally half buried in some <num value="40">forty</num> volumes of <persName n="Balzac,,,,," id="n0215.0021.00293.01105" reg="mostcommon:Balzac,nomatch:0"><surname>Balzac</surname></persName> which had just been given her as a birthday present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>She was cutting the leaves of the least desirable volume, and exclaimed to me, <quote>I take refuge in <persName n="Balzac,,,,," id="n0215.0021.00293.01106" reg="mostcommon:Balzac,nomatch:0"><surname>Balzac</surname></persName> from the heartlessness of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Then she went on to denounce this society freely, but always excepted eagerly her hostess, who was <quote>too good for it</quote> ; and only complained of her that she had at that moment in the house <num value="2">two</num> young girls, daughters of an eminent reformer, who were utterly out of place, she said,--knowing neither how to behave, how to dress, nor how to pronounce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>Never in my life, I think, did I hear a denunciation more honorable to its object, especially when coming from such a source.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>I never have encountered, at home or abroad, a group of people so cultivated and agreeable as existed for a few years in <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName> in the summers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>There were present, as intellectual and social forces, not merely the <name>Howes</name>, but such families as the <name>Bancrofts</name>, the <name>Warings</name>, the <name>Partons</name>, the <name>Potters</name>, the <name>Woolseys</name>, the <name>Hunts</name>, the <name>Rogerses</name>, the <name>Hartes</name>, the <name>Hollands</name>, the <name>Goodwins</name>, <placeName reg="Kate Field">Kate Field</placeName>, and others besides, who were readily brought together for any intellectual enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>I cannot, however, shut my eyes on the fact, that <num value="1">one</num> <hi rend="italics">very</hi> important and principal cause of the difference between our University and the <num value="1">one</num> here is the different value we affix to a good library, and the different ideas we have of what a good library is. In <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> we look on the <name>Library</name> at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> as a wonder, and I am sure nobody ever had a more thorough veneration for it than I had; but it was not necessary for me to be here <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> to find out that it is nearly or quite half a century behind the libraries of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and that it is much less remarkable that our stock of learning is so small than that it is so great, considering the means from which it is drawn are so inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>But what <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> is worse than the absolute poverty of our collections of books is the relative inconsequence in which we keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>We found new professorships and build new colleges in abundance, but we buy no books; and yet it is to me the most obvious thing in the world that it would promote the cause of learning and the reputation of the <rs type="place">University</rs> <num value="10">ten</num> times more to give <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">six thousand dollars</measure> a year to the <name>Library</name> than to found <num value="3">three</num> professorships, and that it would have been wiser to have spent the whole sum that the new chapel had cost on books than on a fine suite of halls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>The great evil with us is, in our primary schools, the best years for learning are trifled and whiled away; boys learn nothing because they have no instructors, because we demand of <num value="1">one</num> the full [work?] of <num value="10">ten</num>, and because laziness is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson which <num value="1">one</num> gets in all our great schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>I know very well that we want but few closet scholars, few learned philologists, and few verbal commentators; that all our systems of government and customs and life suppose a preparation for making practical men, men who move, and are felt in the world; but all this could be better done without wasting every year from infancy to manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>The system of education here is the very reverse of our own: in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> boys are let loose upon the work when they are children, and fettered when they are sent to our college; here they are cloistered, too much so I acknowledge, till they can guide themselves, and then put at their own disposal at the universities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/><persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>'s Reformation threw all the monkish establishments in the <name>Protestant</name> countries into the hands of the <name>Princes</name>, and they very wisely appropriated them to the purposes of education, but unluckily they have retained more of the monastic seclusion than they ought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>They are all very famous, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> more particularly; out of it have come half of the great scholars of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>Still they <pb id="p.335" n="335"/> are essentially defective in the point above named.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>You say you wish to hear from me what hours of relaxation I have, and what acquaintances I make, in this part of the <name>Continent</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is very easily told, and the last would not have been difficult before the journey from which I have just returned; but now the number is more than I can write or you <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> willingly hear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>However, I will answer both your inquiries in the spirit in which they are made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>As to relaxation, in the sense of the word in which I used to employ it at home,--meaning the hours I lounged so happily away when the weariness of the evening came, on your sofa, and the time I used to pass with my friends in general, I know not how or why, but always gayly and thoughtlessly,--of this sort of relaxation I know nothing here but the end of an evening which I occasionally permit myself to spend with <persName n="Cogswell,,,,," id="n0215.0023.00336.01311" reg="nearbymention:Cogswell,Joseph,Green,,"><surname>Cogswell</surname></persName>, whose residence here has in this respect changed the whole color of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>During the last semester, I used to visit occasionally at about <num value="20">twenty</num> houses in <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName>, chiefly as a means of learning to speak the language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>As the population here is so changeable, and as every man is left to live exactly as he chooses, it is customary for all those who wish to continue their intercourse with the persons resident here to make a call at the beginning of each semester, which is considered a notice that they are still here and still mean to go into society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>I, however, feel no longer the necessity of visiting for the purpose of learning <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0215.0023.00336.01312" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, and now that <persName n="Cogswell,,,,," id="n0215.0023.00336.01313" reg="nearbymention:Cogswell,Joseph,Green,,"><surname>Cogswell</surname></persName> is here cannot desire it for any other purpose; have made visits only to <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of the professors, and shall, therefore, not go abroad at all. As to exercise, however, I have enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/><num value="3">Three</num> times a day I must cross the city entirely to get my lessons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>I go out twice besides, a shorter distance for dinner and a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> lesson; and <num value="4">four</num> times a week I take an <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> hour's exercise for consciencea sake and my mother's in the riding-school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/><num value="4">Four</num> times a week I make <persName n="Cogswell,,,,," id="n0215.0023.00337.01314" reg="nearbymention:Cogswell,Joseph,Green,,"><surname>Cogswell</surname></persName> a visit of half an hour after dinner, and <num value="3">three</num> times I spend from <num value="9">nine</num> to <time value="10pm">ten in the evening</time> with him, so that I feel I am doing quite right and quite as little as I ought to do in giving up the remaining <measure n="13hours" type="date">thirteen hours</measure> of the day to study, especially as I gave <num value="14">fourteen</num> to it last winter without injury.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>Before I came to <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName> I used to wonder why it was that he wished to remain here so long; I now wonder he can consent to leave so soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>The truth is, you all mistake the cause of your impatience: you believe <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> that it comes from a desire of seeing him at work for and giving celebrity to the <rs type="place">College</rs>, but it arises from a wish to have him in your society, at your dinner-tables, at your suppers, your clubs, and your ladies, at your tea-parties (you perceive I am aiming at <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> folks): however, all who have formed such expectations must be disappointed; he will find that most of these gratifications must be sacrificed to attain the objects of a scholar's ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>What can men think when they say that <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> are sufficient to make a Greek scholar?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Does not everybody know that it is the labor of half a common life to learn to read the language with tolerable facility?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>I remember to have heard little Drisen say, a few days after I came here, that he had been spending <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure>, at least <measure n="16hours" type="date">sixteen hours</measure> a day, exclusively upon <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, and that he could not now read a page of the tragedians without a dictionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>When I went home I struck <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> from the list of my studies; I now think no more of attaining it than I do of becoming an astrologer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>In fact, the most heart-breaking circumstance attending upon human knowledge is that a man can never go any farther than <quote>to know how little's to be known</quote> ; it fills, then, the mind of scholars with despair to look upon the map of science, as it does that of the traveler to look upon the map of the earth, for both see what a mere speck can be traveled over, and of that speck how imperfect is the knowledge which is acquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>Let any <num value="1">one</num> who believes that he has penetrated the mysteries of all science, and learnt the <pb id="p.339" n="339"/> powers and properties of whatever is contained in the kingdoms of air, earth, fire, and water, but just bring his knowledge to the test; let him, for example, begin with what seems the simplest of all inquiries, and enumerate the plants which grow upon the surface of the globe, and call them by their names, and, when he finds that this is beyond his limits, let him descend to a single class and bring within it all that the unfathomed caves of ocean and the unclimbed mountains bear; and as this is also higher than he can reach, let him go still lower and include only <num value="1">one</num> family, or a particular species, or an individual plant, and mark his points of ignorance upon each, and then, if his pride of knowledge is not humbled enough, let him take but a leaf or the smallest part of the most common flower, and give a satisfactory solution for many of the phenomena they exhibit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>But, you will ask, is <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName> the only place for the acquisition of such learning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>No, not the only, but I believe far the best for such learning as it is necessary for <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> E. to fit him to make <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> in some degree a Gottingen, and render it no longer requisite to depend upon the latter for the formation of their scholars: it is true that very few of what the <name>Germans</name> call scholars are needed in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>; if there would only be <num value="1">one</num> thorough <num value="1">one</num> to begin with, the number would soon be sufficient for all the uses which could be made of them, and for the literary character of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>This <num value="1">one</num>, I say, could never be formed there, because, in the first place, <pb id="p.340" n="340"/> there is no <num value="1">one</num> who knows how it is to be done; secondly, there are no books, and then, by the habits of desultory study practiced there, are wholly incompatible with it. A man as a scholar must be completely <hi rend="italics">upset</hi>, to use a blacksmith's phrase; he must have learnt to give up his love of society and of social pleasures, his interest in the common occurrences of life, in the political and religious contentions of the country, and in everything not directly connected with his single aim. Is there any <num value="1">one</num> willing to make such a sacrifice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>This I cannot answer, but I do assure you that it is the sacrifice made by almost every man of classical learning in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, though to be sure the sacrifice of the enjoyments of friendly intercourse with mankind to letters is paying much less dear for fame here than the same thing would be in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>For my own part I am sorry I came here, because I was too old to be <hi rend="italics">upset</hi>; like a horseshoe worn thin, I shall break as soon as I begin to wear on the other side: it makes me very restless at this period of my life to find that I know nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>I would not have wished to have made the discovery unless I could at the same time have been allowed to remain in some place where I could get rid of my ignorance; and, now that I must go from <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName>, I have no hope of doing that.</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>The only painful feeling I carry with me is that I may not have health, or strength, or ability to fulfill the demands which such an opportunity <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> will create and justify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>More is apt to be expected in such cases than it is possible to perform; besides that, after the schoolmaster is prepared for his duty, all depends upon whether the schoolboy is also prepared for his.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>All we have are bad, the common reading and writing ones not excepted; but of schools which we have to fit boys for college, I think the <orgName n="Boston Latin School" type="school">Boston Latin School</orgName> and the <rs>Andover Academy</rs> are the only ones that deserve the name, and much I doubt if they deserve it. There is much truth in the remark so constantly made that we are not old enough for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> perfection, but we are old enough to do well all it is worth while to do at all; and if a child here in <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> can read and speak Latin fluently, there is no <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> reason why our youth, after spending the same time on it, should know little or nothing about it. Professional education with us commences little or no earlier than it does here, and yet we approach it in all departments with <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> part of the previous qualification which is here possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>But also it is the weakness of mankind to do more than he is obliged to.
