<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In introducing the imaginary Chronicles of P. P., <rs type="role" reg="Clerk">Clerk</rs> of this Parish, the poet <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0191.0003.00001.00003" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> remarks that any such book might well be inscribed, <quote>On the importance of a man to himself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Yet perhaps the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obstacle to be encountered by any autobiographer is the sudden sense of his own extreme unimportance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Does each ant in an ant-hill yearn to bequeath to the universe his personal reminiscences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>When, at the dead of night, I hear my neighbors at the <rs>Harvard Observatory</rs> roll away their lofty shutters, in preparation for their accustomed tryst with the stars, it seems as if <num value="1">one</num> might well be content to keep silence in the presence of the <name>Pleiades</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Yet, after all, the telescope need only be reversed to make the universe appear little, and the observer large; so that we may as well begin at the <num value="1">one</num> end as at the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><pb id="p.2" n="2"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p></p><l>Man is <num value="1">one</num> world, and hath</l> <l>Another to attend him.</l></quote> Probably, if the truth were known, nothing in the universe is really insignificant, not even ourselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>When I think of the vast changes which every man of my time has seen, of the men and women whom I have known,--those who created American literature and who freed <num value="1000000">millions</num> of slaves,--men and women whom, as the worldly-wise <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Houghton</foreName></persName> once wrote me, <quote><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has learned to honor, and would do well to imitate,</quote> then I feel that, whether I will or no, something worth chronicling may be included in the proposed chapters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>For the rest, the autobiographer has the least reason of all writers to concern himself about the portrayal of his own personality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He is sure to reveal it, particularly if he tries to hide it. <persName><foreName>Confucius</foreName></persName> asked, <quote>How can a man be concealed?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Of all methods, certainly not by writing his reminiscences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He can escape unobserved, or else mislead observers, only by holding his tongue; let him open his lips, and we have him as he is.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>All the scenes and atmosphere of <num value="1">one</num>'s native village &mdash; if <num value="1">one</num> is fortunate enough to have been born in such a locality &mdash; lie around the memory like the horizon line, unreachable, <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> impassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Even a so-called cosmopolitan man has never seemed to me a very happy being, and a cosmopolitan child is above all things to be pitied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>To be identified in early memories with some limited and therefore characteristic region,--that is happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>No child is old enough to be a citizen of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>What denationalized <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0191.0003.00003.00004" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> hasten to stamp as provincial is for children, at least, a saving grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>You do not call a nest provincial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>All this is particularly true of those marked out by temperament for a literary career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The predestined painter or musician needs an early contact with the treasures and traditions of an older world, but literature needs for its material only men, nature, and books; and of these, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> are everywhere, and the last are easily transportable, since you can pile the few supreme authors of the world in a little corner of the smallest log cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The <rs>Cambridge</rs> of my boyhood--<num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3000">three thousand</num> peopleafforded me, it now seems, all that human heart could ask for its elementary training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Those who doubt it might, perchance, have been the gainers if they had shared it. <quote>He despises me,</quote> said <persName n="Jonson,,Ben,,," id="n0191.0003.00003.00005" reg="default:Jonson,Ben,,,"><foreName>Ben</foreName> <surname>Jonson</surname></persName>, <quote>because I live in an alley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>My father retained warm friends in his adversity, who bought for him the land where the <rs type="place">Cambridge house</rs> stood, and secured for him the position of steward of the college, the post now rechristened <quote>bursar,</quote> and <num value="1">one</num> in which he did, as <persName n="Peabody,Doctor,A.,P.,," id="n0191.0003.00005.00018" reg="default:Peabody,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName> tells us, most of the duties of treasurer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In that capacity he planted, as I have <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> always been told, a large part of the trees in the college yard,--nobody in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> ever says <quote>campus,</quote> --and had also the wisdom to hang a lamp over each entrance to the yard, although these lamps were soon extinguished by the economical college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>These were my mother's parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It is a rare thing in our American Cambridge to hear of any student as being admired for his scholarship; but when I was taken, <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago, to see the intercollegiate races at the older <rs>Cambridge</rs>, my friends were as careful to point out the men who were <quote>great swells</quote> in chemistry or in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> as to call my attention to <quote>the celebrated stroke, <persName n="Goldie,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00061.00262" reg="mostcommon:Goldie,nomatch:0"><surname>Goldie</surname></persName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The class to which I belonged &mdash; the class of <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>--was compact and tolerably well united, though small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>It had perhaps more than the usual share of class feeling, which probably dated from the time when we had the rare experience of defeating the sophomores at the opening game of football.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>There was an impression that the <name>Faculty</name> were rather afraid of us, a view which would probably have much astonished those worthy gentlemen had it ever reached their ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The strongest impression which is conveyed by looking back on our number collectively, after <num value="0.5">a half</num> century's lapse, is that of the utter impossibility of casting in advance the horoscope of a whole set of young men. The class numbered several who afterwards won distinction in different walks in life; and while the actual careers of some might have been predicted, there were other lives <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> which could not possibly have been anticipated by any of us. It required no great foresight to guess that <persName n="Clarke,,Edward,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00263" reg="default:Clarke,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName> and <persName n="Minot,,Francis,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00264" reg="default:Minot,Francis,,,"><foreName>Francis</foreName> <surname>Minot</surname></persName> would be physicians, and even eminent ones; that <persName n="Woodward,,Rufus,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00265" reg="default:Woodward,Rufus,,,"><foreName>Rufus</foreName> <surname>Woodward</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>, would also be a physician, and a naturalist besides; that Thomas Church <persName n="Smith,,Haskell,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00266" reg="default:Smith,Haskell,,,"><foreName>Haskell</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, who was universally known among us as <quote><persName n="Smith,Captain,,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00267" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Haskell,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>,</quote> and was the natural leader of the class, in case of civil war would become <persName n="Smith,Major-General,,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00268" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Haskell,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and chief of staff in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Other instances might be cited; but, on the other hand, our class produced <num value="3">three</num> men, all well known in later life, whose precise paths were such as no <num value="1">one</num> of the class could ever by any possibility have guessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/><persName n="Parker,,Frank,,," id="n0191.0004.00062.00270" reg="default:Parker,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>, our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> scholar, might naturally, we should all have said, reach the <rs>Supreme Bench</rs> in rapid strides; our ambition for him was unbounded; but that he should, instead of this, become the greatest business lawyer in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, that he should have charge of vast estates, that he should die rich, that his pall-bearers should be bank presidents <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> and millionaires, this was something that no <num value="1">one</num> could have credited in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He had to be very economical in college, as had most of us, -he could go without what he wanted,--but certainly I never surmised in him any peculiar gift for the especially judicious investment of <measure n="0.5dollars" type="currency">a half dollar</measure>. It is a curious illustration of what it is now the fashion to call <quote>heredity</quote> that when this same remark was made to the late <persName n="Peabody,Doctor,A.,P.,," id="n0191.0004.00063.00271" reg="default:Peabody,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName>, who had been <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00063.00272" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Frank,,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s pastor, he replied that it was perfectly true so far as it went, but that any <num value="1">one</num> who had known <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00063.00273" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Frank,,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s father would have comprehended the whole affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The latter, he said, although a clergyman, was the business adviser of half the men in his parish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In another instance, which was yet more remarkable, I know of no such explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Not a classmate of <persName n="Durant,,Henry,Fowle,," id="n0191.0004.00063.00274" reg="default:Durant,Henry,Fowle,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Fowle</foreName> <surname>Durant</surname></persName>'s would ever have dreamed of the <num value="2">two</num> achievements which have probably secured for his name a longer remembrance than will be awarded to any other member of the class; no <num value="1">one</num> would have deemed it possible that he would make a fortune by the practice of criminal law, and then devote it to founding a woman's college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>He lived out of the college yard, was little known in the class, was to all appearances indolent or without concentration-<num value="1">one</num> of the <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> men whose favorite literature lies in old <name>English</name> plays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>His very name was not that by which he afterwards became noted; it being originally <persName n="Smith,,Henry,Welles,," id="n0191.0004.00064.00275" reg="default:Smith,Henry,Welles,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Welles</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and being changed subsequently to gratify a relative who was also his benefactor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Stranger than even this transformation of name and career was the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> bit of the unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The only member of the class who ever landed in the state's prison was precisely and unequivocally the most dignified and respectable man we mustered,--a man absolutely stainless as we knew him, whose whole aspect and bearing carried irresistible weight, and who was chosen by acclamation as the treasurer of our class fund.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>In truth, it was his face and manner that were his ruin; he was a lawyer and had charge of estates; trustful widows and orphans thronged round him and believed in him up to the moment the prison doors opened to receive him; he could no more resist such perilous confidence than could <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00064.00276" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,William,,,:1"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>'s Autolycus, and might say with him, <quote>If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>My only really intimate friend in the class was <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00064.00277" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Frank,,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>, already named, who, although <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> older than myself, and of more staidness of temperament and maturity of character, had <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> great influence over me, and was wonderfully patient with my often serious errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>I frequently spent nights at his room, and we had few secrets from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>All this was in a certain way creditable to us both,--though more so to him, in proportion as he was the superior,--inasmuch as it was a period when the ambition for college rank was intensely strong, and we were running neck and neck for the first place, through the time of our greatest intimacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>He was the better writer, reasoner, and classicist; while I was fond of mathematics, which he hated, and was more successful than he in modern languages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Later, I discovered that we had been extremely close together in rank, most of the time, I sometimes passing him; and that he came out <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by only some <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40bmark" type="currency"><num value="40">forty</num> marks</measure> among many <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It was the only fitting conclusion; and as we were greatly separated, in maturer life, by his conservative and my radical tendencies, I rejoice to record this tribute to his memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>He had, even while in college, a certain cynicism, which was later very much developed, and rather marred his popularity; but his influence on us all was of the greatest value, as it was afterwards in the whole community where he lived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>I formed in college <num value="2">two</num> other friendships, <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> outside my own class, both with men who subsequently rendered real service to literature and art. <num value="1">One</num> was the late <rs>Charles Callahan Perkins</rs>, who became the author of works on the <name>Tuscan</name> and <name>Italian</name> sculptors, and was practically the founder of the <rs type="place">Normal Art School</rs> in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and of the whole system of art instruction in the public schools of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>He was my room-mate during the senior year, and a most attractive person; handsome, refined, manly, without brilliant gifts, but with the most cultivated tastes and-a convenience quite rare among us-a liberal income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of the few instances I have known of a man's being really helped and enlarged in his career by the possession of wealth &mdash; or what then passed for wealth &mdash; in youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The other companion, who did more for my literary tastes than all other friends, was the late <rs>Levi Lincoln Thaxter</rs>, who in after-life helped more than any <num value="1">one</num> to make <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00066.00278" reg="mostcommon:Browning,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Browning</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fitzgerald,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00066.00279" reg="mostcommon:Fitzgerald,Edward,,,:1"><surname>Fitzgerald</surname></persName> known in this country,--they being more widely read here in each case, for a time, than in their own land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>This was the more remarkable as <persName n="Thaxter,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00066.00280" reg="mostcommon:Thaxter,Celia,,,:1"><surname>Thaxter</surname></persName> never saw either of them, although he corresponded with <persName n="Browning,,,,," id="n0191.0004.00066.00281" reg="mostcommon:Browning,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Browning</surname></persName>, who also wrote the inscription for his grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>At my graduation I was <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> short of <num value="18">eighteen</num>, and my purpose was to teach for a few years, and then to study law. This early <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> maturity had, however, <num value="1">one</num> obvious advantage: that it would plainly give me more time to turn round, to pursue general study, and, if need be, to revise my choice of a pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I ultimately used the interval for just these purposes, and was so far a gainer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>In all other respects my youthfulness was a great disadvantage, and I have often dissuaded others from following my example in entering college too young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>If they disregard the remonstrance, as is usually the case, great patience and charity are due them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The reason for this is that precocity scarcely ever extends through all the faculties at once, and those who are older than their years in some respects are almost always younger in others,--this being nature's way of restoring the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Even if intellect and body are alike precocious, the judgment and the moral sense may remain weak and immature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Development in other respects, therefore, creates false expectations and brings unforeseen temptations of its own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>But as these chapters are to be mainly autobiographic, it is well to state with just what outfit I left college in <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>I had a rather shallow reading knowledge of <num value="6">six</num> languages, <name>English</name>, <name>French</name>, Spanish, <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0191.0005.00069.00301" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName>, Latin, and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, and had been brought in contact with some of the best books in each of these tongues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Then I had acquired enough of the higher mathematics to have a pupil or <num value="2">two</num> in that branch; something of the <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> forms of logic and of <persName n="Locke,,,,," id="n0191.0005.00070.00303" reg="mostcommon:Locke,John,,,:1"><surname>Locke</surname></persName>'s philosophy with the criticisms of the <rs>French</rs> eclectics upon it; a smattering of history and political economy; some crude acquaintance with field natural history; some practice in writing and debating; a passion for poetry and imaginative literature; a voracious desire for all knowledge and all action; and an amount of self-confidence which has now, after more than half a century, sadly diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>It will be seen that this was an outfit more varied than graduates of the present day are apt to possess, but that it was also more superficial; their knowledge of what they know being often far more advanced as well as more solidly grounded than was mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>No matter; I was a happy boy, ankle-deep in a yet unfathomed sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>I had <num value="2">two</num> things in addition not set down in the college curriculum, but of the utmost influence on my future career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/><num value="1">One</num> of these has always been to me somewhat inexplicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/><placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> was then a place of distinctly graded society,--more so, probably, than it is now. <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0191.0005.00070.00304" reg="nearbymention:Lowell,James,,,"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> has admirably described the superb way in which old Royal <persName n="Morse,,,,," id="n0191.0005.00070.00305" reg="mostcommon:Morse,Royal,,,:1"><surname>Morse</surname></persName>, the village constable and auctioneer, varied the courtesy of his salutation according to the social position of his acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>I can remember no conversation around me looking toward the essential <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> equality of the human race, except as it was found in the pleased curiosity with which my elder brothers noted the fact that the <rs>President</rs>'s man-servant, who waited at table during his dinner parties, became on the muster field colonel of the militia regiment, and as such gave orders to <persName n="Quincy,Major,,,," id="n0191.0005.00071.00306" reg="mostcommon:Quincy,Edmund,,,:4"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Quincy</surname></persName>, there his subordinate, but at other times his employer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>In each professor's family there was apt to be a country boy <quote>living out,</quote> <quote>doing chores</quote> and attending school; these boys often rose to influence and position in later life, and their children or descendants are now professors in the university and leaders in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The <quote>town school</quote> was distinctly a grade school; I had never entered it; did not play much with the <quote>town boys,</quote> and was rather afraid of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Yet it must have been that there was left over from the <rs>American Revolution</rs> something of the popular feeling then inspired, for without aid or guidance I was democratic in feeling; longed to know something of all sorts and conditions of men, and had a distinct feeling that I should like to be, for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, a mechanic of some kind &mdash; a carpenter or blacksmithin order to place myself in sympathy with all. The nearest I ever came to this was in making some excursions with an elder brother who, as engineer, was laying out the track of the <rs>Old</rs> <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> Colony Railroad, and who took me as <quote>hind chain man</quote> at a dollar a day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>It was at <num value="1">one</num> of these festivities that, when my brother had eaten <num value="1">one</num> piece of mince pie but declined a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> helping, our host remarked with hospitable dignity, <quote>Consult your feelings, sir, about the meat pie.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Another most important change was passing in me at about this time; the sudden development of social aptitudes hitherto dormant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of these nights I had an experience so nearly incredible that I scarcely dare to tell it, yet it was, I believe, essentially true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The walk was then, as is certainly not now the case, a plunge into darkness; and there is no other point from which the transformation of the older <rs>Boston</rs> is more conspicuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>You now cross the bridge at night through a circle of radiant lights glancing in brilliant lines through all the suburbs; but in the old nights there was here and there in the distance a dim oil lamp; in time oil gave place to kerosene; then came gas, then electricity, and still the brighter the lamps, the more they multiplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>There were always public meetings in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to be attended; there were social reform gatherings where I heard the robust <rs>Orestes Brownson</rs> and my eloquent <persName n="Channing,Cousin,William,Henry,," id="n0191.0005.00097.00432" reg="default:Channing,William,Henry,,"><roleName n="Cousin">cousin</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName>; there were anti-slavery conventions, with <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0191.0005.00097.00433" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,W.,L.,,:1"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> and <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0191.0005.00097.00434" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,Wendell,,,:8"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>; then on Sunday there were <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0191.0005.00097.00435" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> and <persName n="Clarke,,James,Freeman,," id="n0191.0005.00097.00436" reg="default:Clarke,James,Freeman,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Freeman</foreName> <surname>Clarke</surname></persName>, to show that <num value="1">one</num> might accomplish something and lead a manly life even in the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>My betrothed was <num value="1">one</num> of the founders of <placeName reg="Clarke's Church">Clarke's Church</placeName> of the <name>Disciples</name>, and naturally drew me there; the services were held in a hall and were quite without those merely ecclesiastical associations which were then unattractive to me, and have never yet, I fear, quite asserted their attraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>To this day I sometimes dream of going to hear him preach,--the great, free, eager congregation; the strong, serious, commanding presence of the preacher; his reverent and earnest prayer; his comprehensive hour-long sermon full of sense, knowledge, feeling, courage, he being not afraid even of his own learning, absolutely holding his audience in the hollow of his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Once in New York a few years ago I went to <persName n="Rainsford,Doctor,,,," id="n0191.0005.00098.00439" reg="mostcommon:Rainsford,W.,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Rainsford</surname></persName>'s church and felt for a moment or <num value="2">two</num>-not, indeed, while the surpliced choir was singing --that I was again in the hands of <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0191.0005.00098.00440" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>This, being interpreted, really meant that the young men there assembled were launched on that wave of liberal thought which, under <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0191.0006.00100.00445" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:2"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0191.0006.00100.00446" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Theodore,,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>, was rapidly submerging the old landmarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>For myself, I was wholly given over to the newer phase of thought, and after a year of unchartered freedom was ready to concentrate my reading a little and follow the few appointed lines of study which the school then required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Without a tithe of my cousin's eloquence, I was of a cooler temperament, and perhaps kept my feet more firmly on the earth or was more guarded in my experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Of all the movements in which I ever took part, except the antislavery agitation, this last-named seems to me the most important; nor have I ever wavered <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> in the opinion announced by <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0191.0006.00121.00558" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, that it is <quote>the grandest reform yet launched upon the century, as involving the freedom of <num value="0.5">one half</num> the human race.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Certainly the antislavery movement, which was by its nature a more temporary <num value="1">one</num>, had the right of way, and must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be settled; it was, moreover, by its nature a much simpler movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Once recognize the fact that man could have no right of property in man, and the whole affair was settled; there was nothing left but to agitate, and if needful to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>But as <placeName reg="Stuart Mill">Stuart Mill</placeName> clearly pointed out, the very fact of the closer relations of the sexes had complicated the affair with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> perplexities in the actual working out; gave room for more blunders, more temporary disappointments, more extravagant claims, and far slower development.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>It was in <num value="1">one</num> respect fortunate that most of the early advocates of the <rs>Woman Suffrage</rs> reform had served previously as Abolitionists, for they had been thereby trained to courage and self-sacrifice; but it was in other respects unfortunate, because they had been accustomed to a stern and simple <quote>Thus saith the <rs>Lord</rs>,</quote> which proved less applicable to the more complex question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>When it came to the point, the alleged aversion of the slaves to freedom always vanished; I never myself encountered an <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> instance of it; every man, woman, and child, whatever protestations might have been made to the contrary, was eager to grasp at freedom; whereas in all communities there is a minority of women who are actively opposed to each successive step in elevating their condition, and this without counting the merely indifferent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>This, to my mind, only confirms its necessity, as showing that, as <persName n="Mill,,,,," id="n0191.0006.00122.00560" reg="mostcommon:Mill,J.,S.,,:1"><surname>Mill</surname></persName> says, the very nature of woman has been to some extent warped and enfeebled by prolonged subjugation, and must have time to recover itself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>It was in the direction of the anti-slavery reform, however, that I felt the most immediate pricking of conscience, and it may be interesting, as a study of the period, to note what brought it about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>This led to pleasant friendships with their families, and to occasional visits paid by my parents, traveling in their own conveyance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>It impressed her greatly, and she put it into her diary, whence my eldest brother, <persName n="Higginson,Doctor,Francis,John,," id="n0191.0006.00123.00564" reg="default:Higginson,Francis,John,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Higginson</surname></persName>, quoted it in a little book he wrote, <quote>Remarks on slavery,</quote> published in <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>This fixed it in my mind, and I remember to have asked my aunt why my uncle in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> did not free his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>She <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> replied that they loved him, and would be sorry to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>This did not satisfy me; but on my afterward visiting the <rs type="place">Virginia plantation</rs>, there was nothing to suggest anything undesirable: the head servant was a grave and dignified man, with the most unexceptionable manners; and the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> children often played together in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>It was then illegal to teach a slave to read, but <num value="1">one</num> girl was pointed out who had picked up a knowledge of reading while the white children were learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The slaves seemed merely to share in the kindly and rather slipshod methods of a Southern establishment; and my only glimpse of the other side was from overhearing conversation between the overseer and his friends, in which all the domestic relations of the negroes were spoken of precisely as if they had been animals.</p>

The curious thing was that although there was a state law of <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct> prohibiting every <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> official from taking any part in the restoration of a fugitive slave, yet nearly all these employees were <persName n="Boston,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00141.00627" reg="mostcommon:Boston,nomatch:0"><surname>Boston</surname></persName> policemen, acting, so the city marshal told me, under orders from the mayor and aldermen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>Under these circumstances there was clearly nothing to be done at the trial itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>And yet all sorts of fantastic and desperate projects crossed the minds of those few among us who really, so to speak, meant business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>I remember consulting <persName n="Loring,,Ellis,Gray,," id="n0191.0007.00141.00628" reg="default:Loring,Ellis,Gray,,"><foreName>Ellis</foreName> <foreName>Gray</foreName> <surname>Loring</surname></persName>, the most eminent lawyer among the <name>Abolitionists</name>, as to the possibility of at least gaining time by making away with the official record from the <rs>Southern</rs> court, a document which lay invitingly at <num value="1">one</num> time among lawyers' papers on the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Again, I wrote a letter to my schoolmate <persName n="Devens,,Charles,,," id="n0191.0007.00141.00629" reg="default:Devens,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Devens</surname></persName>, the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>It is needless to say to those who knew him that he answered courteously and that he reserved his decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>No other chance opening, it seemed necessary to turn all attention to an actual rescue of the prisoner from his place of confinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Like <persName><foreName>Shadrach</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Sims,,Thomas,,," id="n0191.0007.00142.00630" reg="default:Sims,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Sims</surname></persName> was not merely tried in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <placeName reg="Court-House">Court-House</placeName>, but imprisoned there, because the state jail was not opened to him; he not having been arrested under any state law, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> having no jail in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>In the previous case, an effort had been made to obtain permission to confine the fugitive slave at the <rs type="place">Navy Yard</rs>, but <persName n="Downes,Commodore,,,," id="n0191.0007.00142.00631" reg="mostcommon:Downes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Downes</surname></persName> had refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>Was it possible to get him out?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>There was on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> a crowded meeting at <placeName reg="Tremont Temple">Tremont Temple</placeName>, at which <persName n="Mann,,Horace,,," id="n0191.0007.00142.00633" reg="default:Mann,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName> presided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>I hoped strongly that some result might come from this meeting, and made a vehement speech there myself, which, as <persName n="Howe,Doctor,Samuel,Gridley,," id="n0191.0007.00142.00634" reg="default:Howe,Samuel,Gridley,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>Gridley</foreName> <surname>Howe</surname></persName> honored me by saying, was bringing the community to the verge of revolution, when a lawyer named <persName n="Ellis,,Charles,Mayo,," id="n0191.0007.00142.00635" reg="default:Ellis,Charles,Mayo,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>Mayo</foreName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName> protested against its tone, and threw cold <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> water upon all action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>It was evident that if anything was done, it must be done by a very few. I looked round, during the meeting, for a band of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> men from <placeName key="tgn,2050078" n="1.000 4" reg="marlborough, middlesex county, massachusetts">Marlborough</placeName>, who had seemed to me to show more fighting quality than the rest, but they had probably gone home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Under this conviction half a dozen of us formed the following plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>The room where <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00143.00636" reg="nearbymention:Sims,Thomas,,,"><surname>Sims</surname></persName> was confined, being safe by reason of its height from the ground, had no gratings at the windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The colored clergyman of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <persName n="Grimes,Mister,,,," id="n0191.0007.00143.00637" reg="mostcommon:Grimes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Grimes</surname></persName>, who alone had the opportunity to visit <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00143.00638" reg="nearbymention:Sims,Thomas,,,"><surname>Sims</surname></persName>, agreed to arrange with him that at a specified hour that evening he should go to a certain window, as if for air,--for he had the freedom of the room,--and should spring out on mattresses which we were to bring from a lawyer's office across the way; we also providing a carriage in which to place him. All was arranged,--the message sent, the mattresses ready, the carriage engaged as if for an ordinary purpose; and behold!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>in the dusk of that evening, <num value="2">two</num> of us, strolling through <address><street n="Court Square">Court Square</street></address>, saw men busily at work fitting iron bars across this safe <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-story window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Whether we had been betrayed, or whether it was simply a bit of extraordinary precaution, we never knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/><persName n="Montgomery,Colonel,,,," id="n0191.0007.00143.00639" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,James,,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, an experienced guerrilla in <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 41" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName>, used to say, <quote>It <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> is always best to take for granted that your opponent is at least as smart as you yourself are.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>This, evidently, we had not done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>I knew that there was now no chance of the rescue of <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00144.00640" reg="nearbymention:Sims,Thomas,,,"><surname>Sims</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>The only other plan that had been suggested was that we should charter a vessel, place it in charge of <persName n="Bearse,,Austin,,," id="n0191.0007.00144.00641" reg="default:Bearse,Austin,,,"><foreName>Austin</foreName> <surname>Bearse</surname></persName>, a <placeName reg="Cape Cod, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013542">Cape Cod</placeName> sea-captain and <num value="1">one</num> of our best men, and take possession of the <term type="ship">brig</term> <rs type="ship">Acorn</rs>, on which <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00144.00642" reg="nearbymention:Sims,Thomas,,,"><surname>Sims</surname></persName> was expected to be placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>This project was discussed at a small meeting in <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0191.0007.00144.00643" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s study, and was laid aside as impracticable, not because it was piracy, but because there was no absolute certainty that the fugitive would be sent South in that precise way. As no other plan suggested itself, and as I had no wish to look on, with my hands tied, at the surrender, I went back to my home in deep chagrin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>The following extract from a journal written soon after is worth preserving as an illustration of that curious period:--<quote rend="blockquote">

<p>It left me with the strongest impressions of the great want of preparation, on our part, for this revolutionary work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Brought up as we have all been, it takes the whole experience of <num value="1">one</num> such case to educate the mind to the attitude of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>It is so strange to find <num value="1">one</num>'s self outside of established institutions; to be obliged to lower <num value="1">one</num>'s voice and conceal <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> <num value="1">one</num>'s purposes; to see law and order, police and military, on the wrong side, and find good citizenship a sin and bad citizenship a duty, that it takes time to prepare <num value="1">one</num> to act coolly and wisely, as well as courageously, in such an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>Especially this is true among reformers, who are not accustomed to act according to fixed rules and observances, but to strive to do what seems to themselves best, without reference to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The <orgName n="Vigilance Committee" type="committee">Vigilance Committee</orgName> meetings were a disorderly convention, each man having his own plan or theory, perhaps stopping even for anecdote or disquisition, when the occasion required the utmost promptness of decision and the most unflinching unity in action. . . .

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>During the months which followed, I attended anti-slavery conventions; wrote editorially for the newly established <quote>Commonwealth,</quote> the <rs>Boston</rs> organ of the <rs>Free Soil</rs> party; and had also a daily <quote>column</quote> of my own in the <quote>Newburyport Union,</quote> a liberal Democratic paper.

The mere cost in money of <persName n="Sims,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00146.00645" reg="nearbymention:Sims,Thomas,,,"><surname>Sims</surname></persName>'s surrender had been vast; the political results had been the opposite of what was intended, for the election of <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0191.0007.00146.00646" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> to the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>In <dateStruct value="1852--"><year reg="1852">1852</year></dateStruct> I removed to <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>, into a strong anti-slavery community of which my <orgName n="Free Church" type="church">Free Church</orgName> was an important factor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Perhaps the most curious case with which we had to deal was that of a pretty young woman, apparently white, with <num value="2">two</num> perfectly white children, all being consigned to me by <persName n="May,Reverend,Samuel,,," id="n0191.0007.00146.00648" reg="default:May,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>May</surname></persName>, then secretary of the <rs>Boston Anti</rs>-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">Slavery Society</orgName>, and placed by him, for promptness of transportation to <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>, under the escort of a Worcester merchant, thoroughly pro-slavery in sympathy, and not having the slightest conception that he was violating the laws in finding a seat for his charge and holding the baby on his knee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>We had them in our care all winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>She was the daughter of her former master, and was the mistress of her present owner, her half-brother; she could scarcely read and write, but was perfectly ladylike, modest, and grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>There was not <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> only no plan of action, but no set purpose of united action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Could there not be an attack at the very height of the meeting, brought about in this way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Let all be in readiness; let a picked body be distributed near the <rs type="place">Court House</rs> and Square; then send some loud-voiced speaker, who should appear in the gallery of <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName> and announce that there was a mob of negroes already attacking the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs>; let a speaker, previously warned,--<persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00149.00661" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> if possible,--accept the opportunity promptly, and send the whole meeting pell-mell to <address><street n="Court Square">Court Square</street></address>, ready to fall in behind the leaders and bring out the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>So far all seemed ready, and the men were found as well as the general confusion permitted; but the very success and overwhelming numbers of the <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName> meeting soon became a formidable obstacle instead of a help.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>It was the largest gathering I ever saw in that hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>The platform was covered with men; the galleries, the floor, even the outer stairways, were absolutely filled with a solid audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Some came to sympathize, more to look on,--we could not estimate the proportion; <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> but when the speaking was once begun, we could no more communicate with the platform than if the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic Ocean</placeName> rolled between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>There was then no private entrance to it, such as now exists, and in this seemingly slight architectural difference lay the failure of the whole enterprise, as will be presently seen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Those of us who had been told off to be ready in <address><street n="Court Square">Court Square</street></address> went there singly, not to attract attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>No sign of motion or life was there, though the lights gleamed from many windows, for it happened &mdash; a bit of unlooked &mdash; for good fortune &mdash; that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> was holding an evening session, and ordinary visitors could pass freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>Planting myself near a door which stood ajar, on the east side of the building, I waited for the trap to be sprung, and for the mob of people to appear from <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>The moments seemed endless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Would our friends never arrive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Presently a rush of running figures, like the sweep of a wave, came round the comer of <address><street n="Court Square">Court Square</street></address>, and I watched it with such breathless anxiety as I have experienced only twice or thrice in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>The crowd ran on pellmell, and I scanned it for a familiar face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>A single glance brought the conviction of failure and disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>We had the froth and scum of the meeting, the fringe of idlers <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> on its edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>The men on the platform, the real nucleus of that great gathering, were far in the rear, perhaps were still clogged in the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Still, I stood, with assumed carelessness, by the entrance, when an official ran up from the basement, looked me in the face, ran in, and locked the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>There was no object in preventing him, since there was as yet no visible reinforcement of friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>Mingling with the crowd, I ran against <persName n="Stowell,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00153.00671" reg="nearbymention:Stowell,Martin,,,"><surname>Stowell</surname></persName>, who had been looking for the axes, stored at a friend's office in <address><street n="Court Square">Court Square</street></address>. He whispered, <quote>Some of our men are bringing a beam up to the west door, the <num value="1">one</num> that gives entrance to the upper stairway.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Instantly he and I ran round and grasped the beam; I finding myself at the head, with a stout negro opposite me. The real attack had begun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>What followed was too hurried and confusing to be described with perfect accuracy of detail, although the main facts stand out vividly enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Taking the joist up the steps, we hammered away at the southwest door of the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It could not have been many minutes before it began to give way, was then secured again, then swung ajar, and rested heavily, <num value="1">one</num> hinge having parted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>There was room for but <num value="1">one</num> to pass in. I glanced instinctively at my black ally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>He did not even <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> look at me, but sprang in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>In later years the experience was of inestimable value to me, for it removed once for all every doubt of the intrinsic courage of the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>We found ourselves inside, face to face with <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> policemen, who laid about them with their clubs, driving us to the wall and hammering away at our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Often as I had heard of clubbing, I had never before known just how it felt, and to my surprise it was not half so bad as I expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>I was unarmed, but had taken boxing lessons at several different times, and perhaps felt, like <persName n="Holmes,Doctor,,,," id="n0191.0007.00154.00672" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,John,,,:4"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>'s young man named <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, that I had <quote>a new way of counterina I wanted to try;</quote> but hands were powerless against clubs, although my burly comrade wielded his lustily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>All we could expect was to be a sort of clumsy <persName n="Winkelrieds,,Arnold,,," id="n0191.0007.00154.00673" reg="default:Winkelrieds,Arnold,,,"><foreName>Arnold</foreName> <surname>Winkelrieds</surname></persName> and <quote>make way for liberty.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>All other thought was merged in this, the expectation of reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>I did not know that I had received a severe cut on the chin, whose scar I yet carry, though still ignorant how it came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Nor did I know till next morning, what had a more important bearing on the seeming backwardness of my supposed comrades, that, just as the door sprang open, a shot had been fired, and <num value="1">one</num> of the marshal's deputies, a man named <persName n="Batchelder,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00154.00674" reg="mostcommon:Batchelder,F.,L.,,:2"><surname>Batchelder</surname></persName>, had fallen dead.

<p>There had been other fugitive slave rescues in different parts of the country, but this was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drop of blood actually shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>In all the long procession of events which led the nation through the <rs>Kansas</rs> struggle, past the <rs>John Brown</rs> foray, and up to the <rs>Emancipation Proclamation</rs>, the killing of <persName n="Batchelder,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00155.00675" reg="mostcommon:Batchelder,F.,L.,,:2"><surname>Batchelder</surname></persName> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>It was, like the firing on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, a proof that war had really begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>The mob outside was daunted by the event, the marshal's posse inside was frightened, and what should have been the signal of success brought, on the contrary, a cessation of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>The theory at the time was that the man had been stabbed by a knife, thrust through the broken panel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The coroner's inquest found it to be so, and the press, almost as active as now, yet no more accurate, soon got so far as to describe the weapon,--a Malay kris, said to have been actually picked up in the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>For years I supposed all this to be true, and conjectured that either my negro comrade did the deed, or else <persName n="Hayden,,Lewis,,," id="n0191.0007.00155.00676" reg="default:Hayden,Lewis,,,"><foreName>Lewis</foreName> <surname>Hayden</surname></persName>, who was just behind him.<num value="1">1</num> Naturally, we never exchanged a</p>

This vital part of the facts, at the <num value="1">one</num> point which made of the outbreak a capital offense, remained thus absolutely unknown, even to most of the participants, for <measure n="34years" type="date">thirty-four years</measure>. As Drew had seen the revolver loaded in <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName>, and had found, after its restoration, that <num value="1">one</num> barrel had been discharged, and as he was also in the attacking party and heard the firing, there can be no reasonable doubt that the revolver was fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>On the other hand, I am assured by <persName n="Munroe,,George,H.,," id="n0191.0007.00156.00685" reg="default:Munroe,George,H.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Munroe</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, of the <quote><orgName n="Boston Herald" type="newspaper">Boston Herald</orgName>,</quote> who was a member of the coroner's jury, that the surgical examination was a very thorough <num value="1">one</num>, and that the wound was undoubtedly made by a knife or bayonet, it being some <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> long, largest in the middle and tapering towards each end. A similar statement was made at the <pb id="p.157" n="157"/> time, to <num value="1">one</num> of my informants, by <persName n="Jackson,Doctor,Charles,T.,," id="n0191.0007.00157.00686" reg="default:Jackson,Charles,T.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the reported discoverer of etherization, who was <num value="1">one</num> of the surgical examiners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It is therefore pretty certain that <persName n="Stowell,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00157.00687" reg="nearbymention:Stowell,Martin,,,"><surname>Stowell</surname></persName>'s bullet did not hit the mark after all, and that the man who killed <persName n="Batchelder,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00157.00688" reg="mostcommon:Batchelder,F.,L.,,:2"><surname>Batchelder</surname></persName> is still unknown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>All this, however, was without my knowledge; I only knew that we were gradually forced back beyond the threshold, the door standing now wide open, and our supporters having fallen back to leave the steps free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>And though his narrative, like most contemporary narratives, is full of inaccuracies, this statement may be true; it was certainly what I felt, not knowing that a man had already been killed, and that <persName n="Stowell,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00157.00691" reg="nearbymention:Stowell,Martin,,,"><surname>Stowell</surname></persName> and others had just been taken off by the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>I held my place outside, still hoping against hope that some concerted reinforcement might appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>Meanwhile the deputy marshals retreated to the stairway, over which we could see their pistols pointing, the whole hall between us and them being brightly lighted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>The moments passed on. <num value="1">One</num> energetic young lawyer, named <persName n="Webb,,Seth,,," id="n0191.0007.00157.00692" reg="default:Webb,Seth,,,"><foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Webb</surname></persName>, whom I had known in college, ran up the steps, but I dissuaded him from entering <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> alone, and he waited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Then followed <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque incidents of the whole affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>In the silent pause that ensued there came quietly forth from the crowd the well-known form of <persName n="Alcott,Mister,Amos,Bronson,," id="n0191.0007.00158.00693" reg="default:Alcott,Amos,Bronson,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Amos</foreName> <foreName>Bronson</foreName> <surname>Alcott</surname></persName>, the <name>Transcendental</name> philosopher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>Ascending the lighted steps alone, he said tranquilly, turning to me and pointing forward, <quote>Why are we not within?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/><quote>Because,</quote> was the rather impatient answer, <quote>these people will not stand by us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>He said not a word, but calmly walked up the steps,--he and his familiar cane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>He paused again at the top, the centre of all eyes, within and without; a revolver sounded from within, but hit nobody; and finding himself wholly unsupported, he turned and retreated, but without hastening a step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>It seemed to me that, under the circumstances, neither <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00158.00694" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName> nor <persName n="Pythagoras,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00158.00695" reg="mostcommon:Pythagoras,nomatch:0"><surname>Pythagoras</surname></persName> could have done the thing better; and the whole scene brought vividly back the similar appearance of the <rs>Gray Champion</rs> in <persName n="Hawthorne,,,,," id="n0191.0007.00158.00696" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,Nathaniel,,,:1"><surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>'s tale.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>The attempt being a failure and troops approaching, I went down the steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>There is always a farce ready to succeed every tragedy, and mine occurred when a man in the crowd sidled quietly up to me and placidly remarked, <quote><rs type="role2">Mister</rs>, I guess you've left your rumberill.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>It flashed through my mind that before taking hold of the beam I had set down my umbrella for it was a showery day-over the railing of the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Recapturing this important bit of evidence, I made my way <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> to <placeName><persName n="Channing,Doctor,W.,F.,," id="n0191.0007.00160.00704" reg="expanded:Channing,William,Francis,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, had my cut attended to, and went to bed; awaking in a somewhat battered condition the next morning, and being sent off to <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName> by my advisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Then followed my arrest after a few days,--a matter conducted so courteously that the way of the transgressor became easy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>Naturally enough, my neighbors and friends regarded my arrest and possible conviction as a glory or a disgrace according to their opinions on the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>This was not so much from any changeableness or a wish to be credited with versatility,--a quality which I commonly distrusted and criticised in others, --but because there were so many interesting things to write about; and because I had possibly been rather too much impressed by <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0191.0008.00182.00902" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s perilous maxims as applied to any writer, <quote>If he has hit the mark, let others shatter the target.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>There was no indolence about <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> this; it was simply an eager desire to fill all the parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Such versatility makes life very enjoyable, but perhaps not so really useful or successful as a career like that of my contemporary, <placeName reg="Francis Parkman">Francis Parkman</placeName>, who used to be surrounded, even in college, by books of <name>Indian</name> travel and <name>French</name> colonial history, and who kept at work for half a century on his vast theme until he achieved for himself a great literary monument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>The prices then paid were lower than now, but were raised steadily; and he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduced the practice of paying for each manuscript on acceptance, though he always lamented that this failed of its end so far as he was individually concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>His object was to quiet the impatience of those whose contributions were delayed; but he declared that such persons complained more than <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> ever, saying, <quote>Since you valued my contribution so highly as to pay for it, you surely should print it at once.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>He had a virtue which I have never known in any other editor or publisher, --that of volunteering to advance money on prospective articles, yet to be written; and he did this more than once to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>His sympathy with struggling women was always very great; and I think he was the only <num value="1">one</num> in the early <quote>Atlantic</quote> circle, except <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0191.0008.00185.00910" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,Elizabeth,,,:1"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName> and myself,--with <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0191.0008.00185.00911" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> also, latterly,--who favored woman suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>This financial kindliness was a part of his general theory of establishing a staff, in which effort he really succeeded, most of his contributors then writing only for him,--an aim which his successors abandoned, as doubtless became inevitable in view of the rapid multiplication of magazines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>Fields was constantly urging me to attempt fiction, and when I somewhat reluctantly followed his advice, he thought better of the result, I believe, than any <num value="1">one</num> else did; for my story of <quote><persName n="Malbone,,,,," id="n0191.0008.00186.00915" reg="mostcommon:Malbone,nomatch:0"><surname>Malbone</surname></persName>,</quote> especially, he prophesied a fame which the public has not confirmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>I saw before me a man whose mere appearance and bearing refuted in advance some of the strange perversions which have found their way into many books, and which have often wholly missed the type to which he belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>In his thin, worn, resolute face there were the signs of a fire which might wear him out, and practically did so, but nothing of pettiness or baseness; and his talk was calm, persuasive, and coherent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>He was simply a high-minded, unselfish, belated Covenanter; a man whom <persName n="Scott,Sir,Walter,,," id="n0191.0009.00219.01046" reg="default:Scott,Walter,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> might have drawn, but whom such writers as <persName n="Nicolay,,,,," id="n0191.0009.00219.01047" reg="mostcommon:Nicolay,J.,G.,,:1"><surname>Nicolay</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hay,,,,," id="n0191.0009.00219.01048" reg="mostcommon:Hay,George,,,:2"><surname>Hay</surname></persName>, for instance, have utterly failed to delineate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>To describe him in their words as <quote>clean but coarse</quote> is curiously wide of the mark; he had no more of coarseness than was to be found in Habakkuk Mucklewrath or in <persName n="Eliot,,George,,," id="n0191.0009.00219.01049" reg="default:Eliot,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>'s <persName n="Bede,,Adam,,," id="n0191.0009.00219.01050" reg="default:Bede,Adam,,,"><foreName>Adam</foreName> <surname>Bede</surname></persName>; he had, on the contrary, that religious elevation which is itself a kind of refinement,--the quality <num value="1">one</num> may see expressed in many a venerable <placeName reg="Quaker, Cherokee, Kansas" key="tgn,2602769">Quaker</placeName> face at yearly meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>Coarseness absolutely repelled him; he was so strict as to the demeanor of his men that his band was always kept small, while that of <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0191.0009.00219.01051" reg="mostcommon:Lane,James,H.,,:3"><surname>Lane</surname></persName> was large; he had little humor, and none of the humorist's temptation towards questionable conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/><pb id="p.220" n="220"/> Again, to call him <quote>ambitious to irritation,</quote> in the words of the same authors, is equally wide of the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>I saw him afterwards deeply disappointed and thwarted, and this long before his final failure, but never could find in him a trace of mere ambition; he lived, as he finally died, absolutely absorbed in <num value="1">one</num> idea; and it is as a pure enthusiast-fanatic, if you please-that he is to be judged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>His belief was that an all-seeing <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had created the <rs type="place">Alleghany Mountains</rs> from all eternity as the predestined refuge for a body of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>Of the wider organization and membership afterwards formed by him in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> we of course knew nothing, nor could we foresee the imprudence which finally perverted the attack into a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>We helped him in raising the money, and he seemed drawing toward the consummation of his plans, when letters began to come to his <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> supporters from <persName n="Forbes,,Hugh,,," id="n0191.0009.00221.01060" reg="default:Forbes,Hugh,,,"><foreName>Hugh</foreName> <surname>Forbes</surname></persName>, already mentioned, threatening to make the whole matter public unless we could satisfy certain very unreasonable demands for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>On this point our committee was at once divided, not as to refusing the preposterous demands, but because the majority thought that this threat of disclosure made necessary an indefinite postponement of the whole affair; while <persName n="Howe,,,,," id="n0191.0009.00221.01061" reg="mostcommon:Howe,Samuel,Gridley,,:3"><surname>Howe</surname></persName> and myself, and <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n0191.0009.00221.01062" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName> also, as it proved, thought otherwise.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>While, therefore, my regiment had a nominal support, it was constantly hindered: there were difficulties as to uniforms, medicines, and guns; it was often necessary to struggle to obtain more than a Cinderella's portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>This had the farther disadvantage that it tempted us, perhaps, to be sometimes needlessly suspicious; nor was our beloved <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0191.0010.00253.01205" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Rufus,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> always free from oversensitiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Incidentally, also, we found that in all connection with the regular army we must come in for our share of its internal feuds; and we discovered that old <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> grudges were sometimes being wreaked on our unoffending heads, <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0191.0010.00253.01206" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Rufus,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName>'s enemies occasionally striking at him through us. He, on the other hand, distrusted the intentions of <pb id="p.254" n="254"/> certain officers in regard to us, feared lest we should be sacrificed under any orders but his, and sometimes held us back from service when he might better have risked us. All these drawbacks were trifles, however, beside the pleasure of being fairly in military harness, and of bringing into the public service the warlike material which most persons regarded with doubt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>There was also a happiness in dealing with an eminently trustful and affectionate race, and seeing the tonic effect of camp discipline upon the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>In this respect there was an obvious difference between them and the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>Few white soldiers enjoyed serving in the ranks, for itself; they accepted it for the sake of their country, or because others did, or from the hope of promotion, but there was nevertheless a secret feeling in most minds that it was a step down; no person of democratic rearing really enjoys being under the orders of those who have hitherto been his equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>The negroes, on the other hand, who had been ordered about all their lives, felt it a step upward to be in uniform, to have rights as well as duties; their ready imitativeness and love of rhythm made the drill and manual exercises easy for them; and they rejoiced in the dignity of guard and outpost duty, which they did to perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>It is, however, a great mistake to <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> suppose that slavery, as such, was altogether a good preparation for military life; and the officers who copied the methods of plantation overseers proved failures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>It was necessary to keep constantly before the men that they were much more than slaves, to appeal to their pride as soldiers, to win their affection also, and then to exercise absolute justice; and the officer who did all this could wind them round his finger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Through such influences it was needful to teach them, among other things, to obey the non-commissioned officers of their own color, and this they at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> found hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/><quote>I don't want him to play de white man ober me,</quote> was a frequent remark in such cases, and the objection had to be patiently met by explaining that color had nothing to do with it; that they obeyed their sergeants only as those sergeants obeyed their captains, or the captains yielded to me, or I took my orders from the general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>In a little while this became perfectly clear to their minds, and they were proud, not offended, when sent on some expedition under a sergeant of their own race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>This was made easier by the fact that we had among the non &mdash; commissioned officers much admirable material; and the <rs type="role" reg="color-Sergeant">color-sergeant</rs>, <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Rivers</foreName></persName>, was not only a man of distinguished appearance, but superior in the power of command to half of the white <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> officers in the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>He had previously been the most conspicuous private coachman in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>; there had been a reward of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> offered for him when he escaped from slavery; and once, when visiting New York as <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0191.0010.00256.01207" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,David,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s orderly, he had been mobbed in the street for wearing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> uniform, and had defended himself successfully against half a dozen men, taking his position in a doorway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>After the war he was appointed a justice of the peace in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>It was a fortunate thing for both <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0191.0010.00256.01208" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Rufus,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> and myself that each of us had been satisfied in advance of the essential courage of the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>In my case this was the result of a little experience, previously related, at the <name>Bums</name> riot,--when a negro stepped into the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> door before me; in <persName n="Saxton,,,,," id="n0191.0010.00256.01209" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Rufus,,,"><surname>Saxton</surname></persName>'s case it came from his participation in the war between the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>We were thus saved from all solicitude such as beset for a time the mind of that young hero, <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,Robert,,," id="n0191.0010.00256.01210" reg="default:Shaw,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, when he took the field, <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> later, with his <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> colored regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>When I <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> rode over to his camp to welcome him, on his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrival, he said that while I had shown that negro troops were effective in bush-fighting, it had yet to be determined how they would fight in line of battle; and I expressing no doubt on this point, he suggested that it would always be possible to put another line of soldiers behind a black regiment, so as to present equal danger in either direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>I was amazed, for I never should have dreamed of being tempted to such a step; and he learned a lesson of more confidence when his men followed him upon the parapets of <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Fort Wagner</placeName>, after a white regiment, in a previous assault, had lain down and refused to face the terrific fire from that almost impregnable fort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>The colored soldiers caused me, and I think caused their officers generally, no disappointment whatever in respect to courage or conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>As <persName n="Saxton,General,,,," id="n0191.0010.00257.01211" reg="nearbymention:Saxton,Rufus,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Saxton</surname></persName> wrote to a Northern <orgName n="Inquiry Committee" type="committee">committee of inquiry</orgName> as to the freed blacks, they were <quote>intensely human.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>They were certainly more docile than white soldiers, more affectionate, and more impulsive; they probably varied more under different officers and were less individually self-reliant, but were, on the other hand, under good guidance, more eager and impetuous than whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>They had also, in the case of my regiment, a valuable <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> knowledge of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>They were very gregarious, and liked to march together even on a fatigue party, singing as they marched, whereas white soldiers on such service were commonly to be seen tramping along singly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>In regard to courage, there was not, I suspect, much difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>Most men have the ordinary share of that attribute; comparatively few are adventurous; the commander of any regiment, <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>, soon knew perfectly well just which of his men would be likely to volunteer for a forlorn hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>Whether the better education and social position of white soldiers brought them more under the influence of what <persName n="Sidney,Sir,Philip,,," id="n0191.0010.00258.01212" reg="default:Sidney,Philip,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Philip</foreName> <surname>Sidney</surname></persName> calls <quote>the great appetites of honor</quote> I cannot say; this being, it will be remembered, <placeName reg="Sidney, Shelby, Ohio" key="tgn,2081887">Sidney</placeName>'s reason for expecting more courage from officers than from enlisted men. It is quite certain, on the other hand, that any want of such qualities was more than balanced by the fact that the black soldiers were fighting for their freedom and that of their families, this being the most potent of all motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>They used often to point out, in conversation, that they had really far more at stake than their officers had, since, if the <rs>Confederates</rs> conquered, or even if it were a drawn game, the negroes would all relapse into slavery, while their white officers would go back <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> to the <rs>North</rs> and live much as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>This solicitude was at the foundation of all their enthusiasm; and besides this there was their religious feeling, which was genuine and ardent, making them almost fatalists in action, and giving their very amusements that half-pious, half-dramatic character which filled the camp every evening with those stirring songs that I was perhaps the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> person to put in print, and that have reached so many hearts when sung by the <rs>Hampton</rs> singers and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>Riding towards the camp, just after dark, I could hear, when within <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half-mile</measure> or thereabouts, the chorus of the song and the rhythmical clapping of hands; and as I drew nearer, the gleam of the camp-fires on the dusky faces made the whole scene look more like an encampment of Bedouin Arabs than like anything on the <rs>Atlantic</rs> shores.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>Before I had joined the regiment, detachments of recruits had been sent down the coast of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> to destroy saltworks and bring away lumber; and after it had grown to fuller size, there occurred several expeditions into the interior, under my command, with or without naval escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>We went by ourselves up the <placeName reg="Saint Marys River, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2637616">St. Mary's River</placeName>, where the men were for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time actively under fire, and acquitted themselves well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>The river <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> itself was regarded by naval officers as the most dangerous in that region, from its great rapidity, its sudden turns, and the opportunity of attack given by the projecting bluffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>To this day I have never understood why our return was not cut off by the enemy's felling trees, which could have been done easily at several points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>We were on a <quote>double-ender,</quote> --a steamer built for a ferry-boat, and afterwards protected by iron plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>There was often no way of passing a sharp curve, in descending, except by running <num value="1">one</num> end ashore and letting the swift current swing the other extremity round, after which we steamed downwards, the engine being reversed, till the process was repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>At these points the enemy always mustered in numbers, and sometimes tried to board the vessel, besides pouring volleys on our men, who at such times were kept below, only shooting from the windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>The captain of my boat was shot and killed, and I shall never forget the strange sensation when I drew his lifeless form into the pilot-house which he had rashly quitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>As I stood on the deck, while we were in action with a shore battery, I felt a sudden blow in the side, doubling me up as if a Sullivan or a Fitzsimmons had struck me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>I even found myself recalling a tale of <persName n="Tennyson,,,,," id="n0191.0011.00292.01345" reg="mostcommon:Tennyson,Alfred,,,:1"><surname>Tennyson</surname></persName> and his wife, who were sitting beneath a <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> tree and talking unreservedly, when they discovered, by a rustling in the boughs overhead, that <num value="2">two</num> New York reporters had taken position in the branches and were putting down the conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Fortunately, I saw on the drawing-room table an open letter from <num value="1">one</num> of the ladies just mentioned, announcing my approach, and it lay near a window, through which, as I had been told, the master of the house did not hesitate to climb, by way of escape from any unwelcome visitor.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>I therefore sent up my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>He greeted me shyly, gave me his hand, which was in those days a good deal for an Englishman, and then sidled up to the mantelpiece, leaned on it, and said, with the air of a vexed schoolboy, <quote>I am rather afraid of you <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0191.0011.00293.01346" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>; your countrymen do not treat me very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Strange to say, the effect of this curious attack was to put me perfectly at my ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>It was as if I had visited <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0191.0011.00294.01348" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,William,,,:1"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, and had found him in a pet because some <num value="1">one</num> of my fellow countrymen had spelled his name wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>He perhaps recognized my good intentions, and took me to his study, then to his garden, where the roses were advanced beyond any I had yet seen in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>I was struck, in his conversation, with that accuracy of outdoor knowledge which <num value="1">one</num> sees in his poems; he pointed out, for instance, which ferns were <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName>, and which had been attempted in this country, but had refused to grow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>This I should not venture to say, but I noticed that when he was speaking of other men, he <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> mentioned as an important trait in their character whether they liked his poems or not,--<persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0191.0011.00295.01352" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,John,,,:2"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>, he evidently thought, did not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>All this, however, I did not recognize at the time so clearly as I do now; nor was I sure that I, at least, was accomplishing much for the cause I loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>It was hard to persuade him to write even a pamphlet or a circular, although when he did it was done with such terseness and vigor as to refute his theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>Of this I was gradually convinced, but there was a long period during which I accepted the alternative offered by him, and therefore reasoned that because literature was my apparent vocation, oratory was not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>During a long intervening period, however, I <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> lectured a great deal in what were then called <quote>lyceum</quote> courses, which stretched over the northern half of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, to an extent now hardly conceivable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> large organizations, or bureaus, which undertook systematically the task of bringing speaker and audience together, with the least possible inconvenience to both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>As a result, the lecturer left home with a printed circular in his pocket, assigning his dozen or his <num value="100">hundred</num> engagements, as the case might be. Many of these might be in towns of which he had never heard the names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>No matter; he was sure that they would be there, posted a day's journey apart, and all ready to receive him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>He would receive the usual compliments, if any, and make the same courteous reply to the accustomed questions as to the acoustics of the hall and the intelligence of the <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>In the far <rs>West</rs> he would perhaps reach villages where, as the people came <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> for their entertainments, a dance might be combined with the lecture,--<quote>tickets to <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00331.01516" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:2"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> and ball, <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>To the literary man, ordinarily kept at home by task work or by domestic cares,--and both of these existed in my own case,--there was a refreshing variety in a week or <num value="2">two</num>, possibly a month or more, of these lecturing experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>Considered as a regular vocation, such lecturing was benumbing to the mind as well as exhausting to the body, but it was at any rate an antidote for provincialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>It was a good thing to be entertained beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, at a house which was little more than a log cabin, and to find, as I have found, <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00331.01518" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,Samuel,,,:2"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> Dante on the table and Millais' Huguenot Lovers on the wall; or to visit, as I once visited, a village of <num value="40">forty</num> houses, in the same region, in <num value="19">nineteen</num> of which the <orgName n="Atlantic monthly" type="newspaper">Atlantic monthly</orgName> was regularly taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>After such experiences a man could go back to his writing or his editing with enlarged faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>He would get new impressions, too, of the dignity and value of the lecture system itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of my trips, while on a small branch railway in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, I found everybody talking about the prospective entertainment of that evening, --conductor, brakemen, and passengers all kept recurring to the subject; everybody was going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>As we drew near the end, the conductor singled me out as the only stranger and the probable lecturer, and burst into eager explanation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>There was something pleasant, also, in the knowledge that the lecturer himself met the people as man to man; that he stood upon the platform to be judged and weighed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>From <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> the talk of his fellow travelers in the train, beforehand, he could know what they expected of him; and from the talk next morning, how he had stood the test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>The lecture system was long since shaken to pieces in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> by the multiplying of newspapers and the growth of musical and dramatic opportunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>The transition was easy from the lyceum course to the political platform, and this, at least, has held its own. No delusion is harder to drive out of the public mind than the impression that college-bred American men habitually avoid public duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>It may hold in a few large cities, but is rarely the case in country towns, and in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> generally is quite untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>There is nothing exceptional in all this; it is a common thing for American citizens to have rendered as much service as is here stated, and in the university city where I dwell it is the rule, and not the exception, for professors and instructors to take their share in public duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>I confess that it makes me somewhat indignant to hear such men stigmatized as mere idealists and dilettantes by politicians who have never in all their lives done so much to purify and elevate politics as these men have been doing daily for many years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>Side by side with this delusion there is an impression, equally mistaken, that college-bred men are disliked in politics, and have to encounter prejudice and distrust, simply by reason of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>On the other hand, there existed among the members certain vast and inscrutable undercurrents of prejudice; as, for instance, those relating to the rights of towns, or the public school system, or the law of settlement, or perhaps only questions of roads and navigable streams, or of the breadth of wheels or the close time of fishing, --points which could never be quite appreciated by academic minds or even city-bred minds, and which yet might at any moment create a current formidable to encounter, and usually impossible to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>Every good debater in the <rs type="place">House</rs> and every <num value="1">one</num> of its recognized legal authorities might be on <num value="1">one</num> side, and yet the smallest contest with <num value="1">one</num> of these latent prejudices would land them in a minority.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>There were men in the <rs type="place">House</rs> who scarcely ever spoke, but who comprehended these prejudices <pb id="p.340" n="340"/> through and through; and when I had a pet measure to support, I felt more alarmed at seeing <num value="1">one</num> of these men passing quietly about among the seats, or even conversing with a group in the cloak-room, than if I had found all the leaders in the legislature opposed to me. Votes were often carried against the leaders, but almost never against this deadly undertow of awakened prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>No money could possibly have affected it; and indeed the attempt to use money to control the legislature must then have been a very rare thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>There was not then, and perhaps is not to this day, any organized corporation which had such a controlling influence in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> as have certain railways, according to rumor, in <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>Something of this power has been attributed, since my time, perhaps without reason, to the great West End Railway; but there was certainly only <num value="1">one</num> man in the legislature, at the time I describe, who was generally believed to be the agent of a powerful corporation; and although he was <num value="1">one</num> of the most formidable debaters in the house, by reason of wit and brilliancy, he yet failed to carry votes through this general distrust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>Men in such bodies often listen eagerly, for entertainment, to an orator who commands after all but few votes, while they are perhaps finally convinced, <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> nevertheless, by some dull or stammering speaker who thoroughly comprehends what he is discussing and whose sincerity is recognized by all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Perhaps the most tedious but often the most amusing part of legislative life consists in the hearings before committees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>I was at different times <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00341.01530" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> chairman of committees on constitutional amendments, on education, on woman suffrage, and on <quote>expediting the business of the <rs type="place">House</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>All these were liable to be the prey of what are called cranks, but especially the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these, which gathered what <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00341.01531" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:2"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> once called <quote>the soul of the soldiery of dissent.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>There were men and women who haunted the <rs type="place">State House</rs> simply to address the sessions of the <rs>Committee</rs> on Constitutional Amendments, and who would have been perfectly ready to take all that part of the business off our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>I find in my notebook that <num value="1">one</num> of these, an Irishman, once said to us, with the headlong enthusiasm of his race, <quote>Before I say anything on this subject, let me say a word or <num value="2">two</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>Then followed an address with more of fact and reasoning than <num value="1">one</num> could possibly associate with such an introduction, but ending with the general conclusion, <quote>It [the biennial method] would give more power to the legislature, for they would centralize more money into their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>I hope every member of the legislature, when this matter comes up, will be voted down.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>All these flowers of speech are taken from my own notebook as kept in the committee.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>I always rather enjoyed being contradicted in the legislature or being cross-examined on the witness-stand; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because the position gives <num value="1">one</num> opportunity to bring in, by way of rejoinder, points which would not have fitted legitimately into <num value="1">one</num>'s main statement, thus approaching the matter by a flank movement, as it were; and again because the sympathy of the audience is always with the party attacked, and nothing pleases the spectators better, especially in the court-room, then to have a witness turn the tables on the lawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>It is much the same in legislative bodies, and nothing aided the late <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0191.0013.00342.01533" reg="nearbymention:Butler,B.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> more than the ready wit with which he would baffle the whole weight of argument <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> by a retort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>The same quality belonged to the best rough-and-ready fighter in the <orgName n="Massachusetts Legislature" type="legislature">Massachusetts legislature</orgName> of <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct>,--a man to whom I have already referred as lacking the confidence of the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>He was a man who often hurt the cause he advocated by the brutality of his own argument, and was never so formidable as when he was driven into a corner, and suddenly, so to speak, threw a somerset over his assailant's head and came up smiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>I remember to have been once the victim of this method when I felt safest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>I was arguing against <num value="1">one</num> of those bills which were constantly reappearing for the prohibition of oleomargarine, and which usually passed in the end, from a sheer desire to content the farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>I was arguing-what I have always thought to this day &mdash; that good oleomargarine was far better than bad butter, and should not be prohibited; and I fortified this by a story I had just heard of a gentleman in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, who had introduced the substitute without explanation at a lunch he had lately given, and who, on asking his guests to compare it with the best butter, also on the table, found them all selecting the oleomargarine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs> had seemed about equally divided, and I thought my little anecdote had carried the day, when <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>--arose and with the profoundest seriousness asked, <quote>Will <pb id="p.344" n="344"/> the gentleman kindly inform us at what precise stage of the lunch party this test was applied?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>The retort brought down the house instantly, and the rout which followed was overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>It readily occurred to the experienced, or even to the inexperienced, that at a convivial party in New York there might arrive a period when the judgment of the guests would lose some of its value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>I had, in the legislature, my fair share of successes and failures, having the pleasure, for instance, of reporting and carrying through the present law which guarantees children in public schools from being compelled to read from the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> against the wish of their parents, and also the bill giving to the <rs type="place">Normal Art School</rs> a dwelling-place of its own. I contributed largely, the reporters thought, to the defeat of a measure which my constituents generally approved, the substitution of biennial sessions for annual; and have lived to see it finally carried through the legislature, and overwhelmingly defeated by the popular vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>I supported many propositions which required time to mature them and have since become laws; as the abolition of the poll tax qualification for voting, and the final effacement of the school district system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>Other such measures which I supported still require farther time for agitation, as woman suffrage <pb id="p.345" n="345"/> and the removal of the stigma on atheist witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>The latter, as well as the former, was very near my heart, since I think it an outrage <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to admit the evidence of atheists, and then admit evidence to show that they are such,a contradiction which <persName n="Longfellow,Professor,,,," id="n0191.0013.00345.01534" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,Samuel,,,:2"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> described as <quote>allowing men to testify, and then telling the jury that their testimony was not worth having.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>This measure was defeated, not by the <rs>Roman Catholics</rs> in the <rs type="place">House</rs>, but by the <name>Protestants</name>, the representatives of the former being equally divided; a result attributed mainly to my having a certain personal popularity among that class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>A more curious result of the same thing was when the woman suffrage bill was defeated, and when <num value="4">four</num> <orgName n="Irish American" type="newspaper">Irish-American</orgName> members went out and sat in the lobby,--beside <persName n="Plunkett,Mister,,,," id="n0191.0013.00345.01535" reg="mostcommon:Plunkett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Plunkett</surname></persName>, the armless sergeant-at-arms, who told me the fact afterwards, -not wishing either to vote for the bill or to vote against what I desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>I rejoice to say that I had the same experience described by <persName n="Roosevelt,,Theodore,,," id="n0191.0013.00345.01536" reg="default:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>, in finding my general liking for the <name>Irish</name> temperament confirmed by seeing men of that race in public bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>Often unreasonable, impetuous, <num value="1">one</num>-sided, or scheming, they produce certainly some men of a high type of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>There was no <num value="1">one</num> in the legislature for whose motives and habits of mind <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> I had more entire respect than for those of a young <orgName n="Irish American" type="newspaper">Irish-American</orgName> lawyer, since dead, who sat in the next seat to mine during a whole session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>I believe that the instinct of this whole class for politics is on the whole a sign of promise, although producing some temporary evils; and that it is much more hopeful, for instance, than the comparative indifference to public affairs among our large <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00346.01537" reg="mostcommon:French,Jonas,H.,,:2"><surname>French</surname></persName>-<placeName reg="Canadian River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019930">Canadian</placeName> population.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>The desire for office, once partially gratified, soon becomes very strong, and the pride of being known as a <quote>vote-getter</quote> is a very potent stimulus to <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00346.01538" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and is very demoralizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>Few men are willing to let the offices come to them, and although they respect this quality of abstinence in another, if combined with success, they do not have the same feeling for it <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>. They early glide into the habit of regarding office as a perquisite, and as something to be given to the man who works hardest for it, not to the man who is best fitted for it. Money too necessarily enters into the account, as is shown by the habit of assessing candidates in proportion to their salaries &mdash; a thing to which I have always refused to submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>Again, I am sorry to say, there is a certain amount of hypocrisy on the subject, and men often carry on a still hunt, as it is technically <pb id="p.347" n="347"/> called, and do not frankly own their methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>I remember when, some <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, a man eminent in our public life was boasting to me of the nomination of his younger brother for Congress, and this especially on the ground that whereas his competitor for the nomination had gone about promising offices and other rewards to his henchmen, the successful candidate had entirely refused to do anything of the kind, and had won on his merits alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>Afterward, on my asking the manager of the latter's campaign whether there was really so much difference in the methods of the <num value="2">two</num>, he said with a chuckle, <quote>Well, I guess there was n't much left undone on either side.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>The whole tendency of public life is undoubtedly to make a man an incipient boss, and to tempt him to scheme and bargain; and it is only the most favorable circumstances which can enable a man to succeed without this; it is mainly a question whether he shall do it in person, or through an agent or <quote>wicked partner.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>The knowledge of this drives from public life some men well fitted to adorn it, and brings in many who are unfit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/>The only question is whether there is much variation in this respect between different countries, and whether the process by which a man gets promotion in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, for instance, differs always essentially <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> from the method by which position is gained in American public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>It is my own impression that this is also a case where there is not much left undone on either side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>Here is <num value="1">one</num> plain advantage in the hands of the literary man: that he lives mainly in a world where these various devices are far less needful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>The artist, said <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00348.01539" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, is the only man who lives with unconcealed aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>Successes are often won by inferior productions, no doubt, but it is because these are in some way better fitted to the current taste, and it is very rarely intrigue or pushing which secures fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>It is rare to see a book which succeeds mainly through business strategy; and if such a case occurs, it is very apt to be only a temporary affair, followed by reaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>This, therefore, is an advantage on the side of literature; but, on the other hand, the direct contact with men and the sense of being uncloistered is always a source of enjoyment in public life, and I should be sorry to go altogether without it. Presiding at public meetings, for instance, is a position which affords positive enjoyment to any <num value="1">one</num> to whom it comes easily; it demands chiefly a clear head, prompt decision, absolute impartiality, and tolerable tact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>An audience which recognizes these qualities will almost invariably sustain the chairman; those present <pb id="p.349" n="349"/> have usually come there for a certain purpose, to carry the meeting fairly through, and they will stand by a man who helps to this, though if he is tricky they will rebel, and if he is irresolute they will ride over him. The rules of order are really very simple, and are almost always based on good common sense; and there is the same sort of pleasure in managing a somewhat turbulent meeting that is found in driving a <num value="4">four</num>-in-hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>At smaller meetings of committees and the like, an enormous amount can be done by conciliation; <num value="9">nine</num> times out of <num value="10">ten</num> the differences are essentially verbal, and the suggestion of a word, the substitution of a syllable, will perhaps quell the rising storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>People are sometimes much less divided in purpose than they suppose themselves to be, and an extremely small concession will furnish a sufficient relief for pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>There is much, also, in watching the temper of those with whom you deal and in choosing the fortunate moment,--a thing which the late <persName n="Garfield,President,,,," id="n0191.0013.00349.01540" reg="mostcommon:Garfield,J.,A.,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Garfield</surname></persName>, while leader of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, pointed out to me as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essential of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>There were days, he said, when <num value="1">one</num> could carry through, almost without opposition, measures that at other times would have to be fought inch by inch; and I afterwards noticed the same thing <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> in the <orgName n="Massachusetts Legislature" type="legislature">Massachusetts legislature</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>It is so, also, I have heard the attendants say, even with the wild beasts in a menagerie: there are occasions when the storm signals are raised, and no risks must be taken, even with the tamest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>Probably no other presidential election which ever took place in this country showed so small a share of what is base or selfish in politics as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> election of <persName n="Cleveland,President,,,," id="n0191.0013.00350.01541" reg="mostcommon:Cleveland,Grover,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName>; and in this I happened to take a pretty active part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>I was concerned in his original nomination and afterwards spoke in his behalf in <num value="5">five</num> different states, <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, New York, and <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, and was brought closely in contact with the current of popular feeling, which I found a sound and wholesome <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>The fact that he was a new man kept him singularly free from personal entanglements until actually in office; and his rather deliberate and stubborn temperament, with the tone of his leading supporters, gave an added safeguard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>On the other hand, the same slowness of temperament made it impossible for him to supervise all departments at once, and he had to leave some of them in the hands of old-fashioned spoilsmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>There was among those who originally brought him forward &mdash; the so-called Mugwumps &mdash; an almost exaggerated <pb id="p.351" n="351"/> unselfishness, at least for a time; in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, especially, it was practically understood among them that they were to ask for nothing personally; and they generally got what they asked for. <persName n="Cleveland,Mister,,,," id="n0191.0013.00351.01542" reg="mostcommon:Cleveland,Grover,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName>'s administration, with all its strength and weakness, has gone into history; he had, if ever a man had, <hi rend="italics">les dafauts de ses qualitde</hi>, but I cannot remember any <rs type="role2">President</rs> whose support implied so little that was personally unsatisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>This I say although I was led by my interest in him to accept, rather against my will, a nomination for Congress on the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket at the time when <persName n="Cleveland,Mister,,,," id="n0191.0013.00351.01543" reg="mostcommon:Cleveland,Grover,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName> failed of reflection (<dateStruct value="1888--"><year reg="1888">1888</year></dateStruct>). I made many speeches in my own district, mainly in his behalf; and although I was defeated, I had what is regarded in politics as the creditable outcome of having more votes in the district than the head of the ticket.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>There are always many curious experiences in campaign-speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>It will sometimes happen that the orators who are to meet on the platform have approached the matter from wholly different points of view, so that each makes concessions which logically destroy the other's arguments, were the audience only quick enough to find it out; or it may happenwhich is worse &mdash; that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speaker anticipates <pb id="p.352" n="352"/> the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> so completely as to leave him little to say. It is universally the case, I believe, that toward the end of the campaign every good point made by any speaker, every telling anecdote, every neat repartee, is so quoted from <num value="1">one</num> to another that the speeches grow more and more identical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/><num value="1">One</num> gets acquainted, too, with a variety of prejudices, and gains insight into many local peculiarities and even accents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>I remember that once, when I was speaking on the same platform with an able young <name>Irish</name> lawyer, he was making an attack on the present <persName n="Lodge,Senator,,,," id="n0191.0013.00352.01544" reg="nearbymention:Lodge,Henry,Cabot,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Lodge</surname></persName>, and said contemptuously, <quote><persName n="Lodge,Mister,Henry,Cabot,," id="n0191.0013.00352.01545" reg="default:Lodge,Henry,Cabot,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Cabot</foreName> <surname>Lodge</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7014178" n="1.000 8" reg="nahant, essex county, massachusetts">Nahant</placeName></quote> --and he paused for a response which did not adequately follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>Then he repeated more emphatically, <quote>Of <placeName key="tgn,7014178" n="1.000 8" reg="nahant, essex county, massachusetts">Nahant</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>He calls it in that way, but common people say <placeName key="tgn,7014178" n="1.000 8" reg="nahant, essex county, massachusetts">Nahant</placeName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>Then the audience took the point, and, being largely <persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00352.01546" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName>, responded enthusiastically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>Now, <persName n="Lodge,Mister,,,," id="n0191.0013.00352.01547" reg="nearbymention:Lodge,Henry,Cabot,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lodge</surname></persName> had only pronounced the name of his place of residence as he had done from the cradle, as his parents had said it before him, and as all good Bostonians had habitually pronounced it, with the broad sound that is universal among Englishmen, except-as <persName n="Hardy,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n0191.0013.00352.01548" reg="default:Hardy,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Hardy</surname></persName> has lately assured me &mdash; in the <placeName key="tgn,7016852" n="1.000 10" reg="Wessex,England,United Kingdom,Europe">Wessex</placeName> region; while this sarcastic young political critic, on the other hand, representing <pb id="p.353" n="353"/> the <rs>Western</rs> and <name>Southern</name> and <name>Irish</name> mode of speech, treated this tradition of boyhood as a mere bit of affectation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/><num value="1">One</num> forms unexpected judgments of characters, also, on the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>I can remember <num value="1">one</num> well-known lawyer,--not now living,with whom I was at several times associated, and whose manner to an audience, as to a jury, was so intolerably coaxing, flattering, and wheedling that it always left me with a strong wish that I could conscientiously vote against him. I remember also <num value="1">one</num> eminent clergyman and popular orator who spoke with me before a very rough audience at <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey City</placeName>, and who so lowered himself by his tone on the platform, making allusions and repartees so coarse, that I hoped I might never have to speak beside him again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>Of all the speakers with whom I have ever occupied the platform, the <num value="1">one</num> with whom I found it pleasantest to be associated was the late <persName n="Russell,Governor,William,Eustis,," id="n0191.0013.00353.01549" reg="default:Russell,William,Eustis,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Eustis</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>Carrying his election <num value="3">three</num> successive times in a state where his party was distinctly in the minority, he yet had, among all political speakers whom I have ever heard, the greatest simplicity and directness of statement, the most entire absence of trick, of claptrap, or of anything which would have lowered him. Striking directly at the main line of <pb id="p.354" n="354"/> his argument, always well fortified, making his points uniformly clear, dealing sparingly in joke or anecdote, yet never failing to hold his audience, he was very near the ideal of a political speaker; nor has the death of any man in public life appeared so peculiar and irremediable a loss.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>On the election of John Davis Long, now <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, as governor of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct>, he asked me to act on his military staff; and although I had not known him personally, I felt bound to accept the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>The position is commonly regarded in time of peace as merely ornamental, but I had learned during the civil war how important it might become at any moment; and as nearly all his staff had seen some actual service, I regarded the appointment as an honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>So peaceful was his administration that my chief duty was in representing him at public dinners and making speeches in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>Sometimes, however, I went with him, and could admire in him that wondrous gift, which is called in other countries <quote>the royal faculty,</quote> of always remembering the name of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>With the utmost good will toward the human race, I never could attain to this gift of vivid personal recollection, and could only admire in my chief the unerring precision with which he knew in each <pb id="p.355" n="355"/> case whether it was his constituent's wife or grand-aunt who had been suffering under chronic rheumatism last year, and who must now be asked for with accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>He had, too, the greatest tact in dealing with his audiences, not merely through humor and genial good sense, but even to the point of risking all upon some little stroke of audacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>This happened; for instance, when he delighted the <name>Ancient</name> and <orgName n="Honorable Artillery" type="artillery">Honorable Artillery</orgName>, a body made up from various military and non-military ingredients, by complimenting them on their style of marching, --which was rarely complimented by others,and this on the ground that he did <quote>not remember ever to have seen just such marching.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>The shot told, and was received with cheer upon cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>Almost the only mistake I ever knew this deservedly popular official to make in dealing with an audience was when he repeated the same stroke soon after upon a rural semi-military company of somewhat similar description, which received it in stern and unsympathetic silence; for it was their marching upon which these excellent citizens had, perhaps mistakenly, prided themselves the most.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>The <rs>Nemesis</rs> of public speaking &mdash; the thing which makes it seem almost worthless in the long run &mdash; is the impossibility of making it tell for anything after its moment is past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/><pb id="p.356" n="356"/> A book remains always in existence,--<foreign lang="la">littera scripta manet</foreign>,--and long after it seems forgotten it may be disinterred from the dust of libraries, and be judged as freshly as if written yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>The popular orator soon disappears from memory, and there is perhaps substituted in his place some solid thinker like <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00356.01550" reg="nearbymention:Burke,Edmund,,,"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, who made speeches, indeed, but was called <quote>the <rs>Dinner Bell</rs>,</quote> because the members of Parliament scattered themselves instead of listening when he rose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>Possibly this briefer tenure of fame is nature's compensation for the more thrilling excitement of the orator's life as compared with the author's. The poet's eye may be in never so fine a frenzy rolling, but he enjoys himself alone; he can never wholly trust his own judgment, nor even that of his admiring family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>A perceptible interval must pass before he hears from his public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>The orator's appreciation, on the other hand, comes back as promptly as an answering echo: his hearers sometimes hardly wait for his sentence to be ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>In this respect he is like the actor, and enjoys, like him, a life too exciting to be quite wholesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>There are moments when every orator speaks, as we may say, above himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>Either he waked that morning fresher and more vigorous than usual, or he has had good news, or the audience is particularly sympathetic; <pb id="p.357" n="357"/> at any rate, he surprises himself by going beyond his accustomed range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>Or it may be, on the other hand, that he has heard bad news, or the audience is particularly antagonistic, so that he gets the warmth by reaction, as from a cold bath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>When <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0191.0013.00357.01551" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was speaking more tamely than usual, the younger Abolitionists would sometimes go round behind the audience and start a hiss, which roused him without fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>The most experienced public speaker can never fully allow for these variations, or foretell with precision what his success is to be. No doubt there may be for all grades of intellect something akin to inspiration, when it is the ardor of the blood which speaks, and the orator himself seems merely to listen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>Probably a scolding fishwoman has her days of glory when she is in remarkably good form, and looks back afterward in astonishment at her own flow of language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>Whatever surprises the speaker is almost equally sure to arrest the audience; his prepared material may miss its effect, but his impulse rarely does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/><quote>Indeed,</quote> as I wrote elsewhere long ago, <quote>the best hope that any orator can have is to rise at favored moments to some height of enthusiasm that shall make all his previous structure of preparation superfluous; as the ship in launching glides from the ways, and scatters cradletimbers <pb id="p.358" n="358"/> and wedges upon the waters that are henceforth to be her home.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>The moral of my whole tale is that while no man who is appointed by nature to literary service should forsake it for public life, yet the experience of the platform, and even of direct political service, will be most valuable to him up to a certain point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>That neither of these avenues leads surely to fame or wealth is a wholly secondary matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/><persName n="Gibbon,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00358.01552" reg="mostcommon:Gibbon,Edward,,,:1"><surname>Gibbon</surname></persName> says of himself that <quote>in circumstances more indigent or more wealthy</quote> he <quote>should never have accomplished the task or acquired the fame of an historian.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>For myself, I have always been very grateful, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for not being rich, since wealth is a condition giving not merely new temptations, but new cares and responsibilities, such as a student should not be called upon to undertake; and secondly, for having always had the health and habits which enabled me to earn an honest living by literature, and this without actual drudgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>Drudgery in literature is not simply to work hard, which is a pleasure, but to work on unattractive material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>If <num value="1">one</num> escapes drudgery, it seems to me that he has in literature the most delightful of all pursuits, but especially if he can get the added variety that comes from having the immediate contact with life which occasional public speaking <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> gives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>The writer obtains from such intercourse that which <persName n="Selden,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00359.01553" reg="mostcommon:Selden,John,,,:1"><surname>Selden</surname></persName>, in his <quote>Table talk,</quote> attributes to the habit of dining in public as practiced by old <name>English</name> sovereigns: <quote>The <rs>King</rs> himself used to eat in the hall, and his lords with him, and then he understood men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>It is, after all, the orator, not the writer, who meets men literally face to face; beyond this their functions are much alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>Of course neither of them can expect to win the vast prizes of wealth or power which commerce sometimes gives; and <num value="1">one</num>'s best preparation is to have looked poverty and obscurity in the face in youth, to have taken its measure and accepted it as a possible alternative,--a thing insignificant to a man who has, or even thinks he has, a higher aim.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>No single sentence, except a few of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00359.01554" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,:2"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s, ever moved me so much in youth as did a passage translated in <persName n="Austen,Mrs.,,,," id="n0191.0013.00359.01555" reg="mostcommon:Austen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Austen</surname></persName>'s <quote><name>German</name> prose writers</quote> from Heinzelmann, an author of whom I never read another word: <quote>Be and continue poor, young man, while others around you grow rich by fraud and disloyalty; be without place or power, while others beg their way upward; bear the pain of disappointed hopes, while others gain the accomplishment of theirs by flattery; forego the gracious pressure of the hand, for which others <pb id="p.360" n="360"/> cringe and crawl; wrap yourself in your own virtue, and seek a friend, and your daily bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>If you have, in such a course, grown gray with unblenched honor, bless <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and die.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>This should be learned by heart by every young man; but he should also temper it with the fine saying of <persName n="Thoreau,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00360.01556" reg="mostcommon:Thoreau,Miss,,,:1"><surname>Thoreau</surname></persName>, that he <quote>did not wish to practice self-denial unless it was quite necessary.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>In other words, a man should not be an ascetic for the sake of asceticism, but he should cheerfully accept that attitude if it proves to be for him the necessary path to true manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>It is not worth while that he should live, like <persName n="Spinoza,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00360.01557" reg="mostcommon:Spinoza,Benedict,,,:1"><surname>Spinoza</surname></persName>, on <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> a day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2165"/>After all, no modern writer can state the relative position of author and orator, or the ultimate aims of each, better than it was done <measure n="18centuries" type="date">eighteen centuries</measure> ago in that fine dialogue which has been variously attributed to Quintilian and <persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n0191.0013.00360.01559" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,C.,C.,,:1"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName>, in which the representatives of the <num value="2">two</num> vocations compare their experience.

<head>Epilogue.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2168"/>In reading reminiscences like those contained in this volume, the public may often justly complain that too much has been told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>The writer, on the other hand, when he comes to review what he has written, may be more justly amazed to see how large a portion of what is to him most important has remained unmentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2170"/>Unless he has by nature the oppressive communicativeness of a French or <placeName reg="Italian">Italian</placeName> autobiographer, he will probably have left unchronicled the most intimate and essential parts of his own existence,--love, friendship, home, society, health,--while only that which is more overt and tangible remains in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>The frankest writer doubtless leaves untold more of the story of his life than he tells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2172"/>For the rest, his career, be it larger or smaller, belongs to his own time; and its record is chiefly valuable for the light it throws on the period and the place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/>It must be borne in mind that <num value="1">one</num> who has habitually occupied the attitude of a reformer must inevitably have some satisfactions, at the <pb id="p.363" n="363"/> latter end of life, which those who are conservative by temperament can hardly share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2174"/>To the latter, things commonly seem to be changing for the worse, and this habit of mind must be a dreary companion as the years advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>The reformer, on the other hand, sees so much already accomplished, in the direction of his desires, that he can await in some security the fulfillment of the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2176"/>Personally I should like to live to see international arbitration secured, civil service reform completed, free trade established; to find the legal and educational rights of the <num value="2">two</num> sexes equalized; to know that all cities are as honestly governed as that in which I dwell; to see natural monopolies owned by the public, not in private hands; to see drunkenness extirpated; to live under absolute as well as nominal religious freedom; to perceive American literature to be thoroughly emancipated from that habit of colonial deference which still hampers it. Yet it is something to believe it possible that, after the progress already made on the whole in these several directions, some future generation may see the fulfillment of what remains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2177"/>To those who were living when the <rs>American</rs> nation lifted and threw off from its shoulders the vast incubus of human slavery, what other task can seem too great to be accomplished?
