<head>Prefatory notice.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>in making this compilation, I have trusted that the memory of the reader would be sufficient for the explanation of most allusions; and commentary would not only have cumbered these pages, but would hardly have been fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Nor have I ventured upon any corrections or alterations of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These articles are precisely what they profess to be; they were, from day to day, hastily written to serve an immediate purpose; and they are, therefore, entitled, I hope, to a lenient and charitable judgment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A book like this would be of little value if it did not, in some respects, illustrate <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary changes in the opinions of a great people which history records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The election of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0001.00000.00031" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> seemed definitely to indicate not merely the perpetuity of Human Slavery in this Republic, but the acquiescence of the people of the <rs>Free States</rs>, or of a majority of them, in the extension of that unhappy institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Its opponents if not silenced, were <pb n="xii"/>decidedly defeated, and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic Party</orgName>, after a <num value="100">hundred</num> previous audacities, continued to hold the <rs>Government</rs> with something of a feeling of invincibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There remained, it is true, throughout the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name>, an Anti-Slavery sentiment which no misfortunes could overcome; but a considerable measure of its activity was to be found among those who abstained from political methods; while <num value="2">two</num> classes of men, the <num value="1">one</num> religious, and the other political, still vehemently insisted that agitation of the <rs>Slavery Question</rs> was in itself an immorality deserving rebuke, and requiring vigorous suppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Of these remarkable apostles of an untimely conservatism, I may be permitted briefly to speak.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="1">One</num> who is outside the pale of ecclesiastical organizations, and who is not an assistant in the manoeuvering of their machinery, finds it difficult to comprehend how any confessor, in the possession of his natural mental faculties, should ever have thought it possible to reconcile Slavery with the precepts of Christianity; yet many unquestionably were left to believe that the <rs>Institution</rs> was Divine in its origin, and that it was still authorized by the <name>Divine</name> sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The hearts of men we may not be permitted to judge, but surely there is no law which forbids us to make a conscientious estimate of their heads; <pb n="xiii"/>and he who, upon the strength of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> little texts-upon the fact of the existence of Slavery among the <name>Jews</name> and in the <rs>Roman</rs> Empire-upon that small portion of history which records the curse upon <placeName reg="Canaan, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063278">Canaan</placeName>, could assert, and in pulpit, newspaper, review, and volume, persist in the assertion that the <name>Slavery</name> of <num value="4000000">Four Millions</num> of Men, in the <rs>Republic</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in the year of Christianity <num value="1850">One Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty</num>,--that such Slavery, utterly modern in its theory and practice, was a thing to be not merely justified, but applauded and defended in the pulpit-he, I say, who could make this large demand upon the faith of his neighbors, must have had <num value="1">one</num> of those narrow and monkish natures which may be capable of a certain degree of usefulness in drilling battalions of neophytes, but which are equally incapable of lofty views or elevated aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If such an <num value="1">one</num> happened to mix a little ethnology with his theology, he gave to the world an irresistible amalgam, which in his opinion precluded argument and paralyzed retort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I suspect if all the literature of this kind, printed in defence of Slavery, could be gathered together, that against all natural rules, a peculiar and disagreeable smell would be noticed in the atmosphere, and that it would even be perceptible in Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><pb n="xiv"/></p> 
<p>I do not know that the <rs>Pro-Slavery Politician</rs> was a whit less absurd; but he had the advantage of confining his argumentation to matters of earth and sense, and of uttering low things from a lower standpoint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He did not <quote>pass the flaming bounds of time and space ;</quote> but restricting himself to the somewhat different atmosphere of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, he was content to limit human progress by existing enactments, and to plead precedent against the piteous appeals of those who sued for redress <hi rend="italics">in forma pauperis</hi>. He had more than the respect of the proverb for <quote>what-ever <hi rend="italics">is</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He not only believed it to be <quote>right,</quote> but he proclaimed it, at the top of his voice, to be immutable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Whatever the <name>Slaveholder</name> asked for, he was ready to accord; and naturally the <name>Slaveholder</name> soon learned that he could not ask for too much.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The position of the <rs>Pro-Slavery Politician</rs> was, although the <rs>Institution</rs> might be hard, cruel, a breaker of hearts, a bender of bodies, and a destroyer of souls, that all this wretchedness must be carried to a sort of political profit and loss; and although Slavery had its evils, yet that it was better to endure them than to fly to others &mdash; the endurance being unfortunately the pious and patriotic perquisite of the <name>Slave</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The matter finally settled itself down into <num value="1">one</num> hard, unflinching formula &mdash; The Union must be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><pb n="xv"/>This was the end of controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This was the limit of discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This was the <rs>Alpha</rs> and <rs>Omega</rs> of our political gospel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This was the touchstone of legislation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Of course, political science being thus reduced to its simplest elements, the <name>Slaveholder</name> having any measure at heart, needed only to cry out that, if denied, he intended to secede, to carry his point with marvelous and triumphant celerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0001.00000.00032" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was a Northern man, but although he is dead, the sad and mortifying truth must be spoken: he had so disciplined himself in this school of what may be called <quote>unconditional surrender,</quote> that he no more dreamed of resistance than he dreamed of resigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was no better and no worse perhaps than his friends; but he had the misfortune to be their representative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>To the last moment of his administration, <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0001.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was faithful to the traditions of his party; and while the bugle call of sedition was sounding through half the <rs>Republic</rs> &mdash; while its flag was defended by a handful of beleaguered and starving men &mdash; while the country stood aghast at the unchecked rapidity with which Treason was stalking over the land, this last, it may be hoped, of all such Democratic <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs>, surrendered a Government which he had done nothing to save into the <pb n="xvi"/>hands of a Republican successor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The times of trial and endurance, of the waste and the glory of war, of painful vicissitude and final victory followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>As the result of that extraordinary struggle, we have now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in our history, a Government which, being consistent with its avowed principles, may truly be designated as <quote>Democratic.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>As I write these pages, I cannot sufficiently express the gratification which I feel at the enormous mass of nonsense which events have eliminated from our future political discussions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When I began to write for <hi rend="italics">The Tribune</hi>, there was hardly a political virtue, hardly a fundamental social truth, hardly a time-honored maxim of humanity, hardly an elementary principle of justice, which we did not have to fight for as if they had been discoveries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There was the ethnologist proving <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of men to be monkeys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There was the <quote>statesman</quote> demonstrating that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was framed expressly to sustain Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There was the clergyman showing Human Bondage to be as necessary as Original Sin. There was the simpering novelist depicting the pastoral pleasures of the plantation, and the patriarchal felicities of the <name>Blacks</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>There was the lawyer pleading that, in certain cases, the <rs>Habeas Corpus</rs> is good for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>And under all there were crowds of prejudiced and unreasoning <pb n="xvii"/>men of every social grade, from the highest to the lowest, who denounced every objector to this condition of affairs as a destructive and a radical, and who thought a flourishing trade with the <rs>South</rs> worth all the morality ever propounded, from Plutarch to <persName n="Paley,Doctor,,,," id="n0054.0001.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Paley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Paley</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It would, doubtless, have been easier &mdash; I know it would often have been thought in better taste &mdash; to have taken a low and despairing view of public affairs, and sadly to have predicted the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> coming of chaos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But, partly perhaps from a constitutional habit, I was led to consider serious subjects cheerfully; although I hardly ever made a jest upon the subject of Slavery without a feeling of self-rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But it must be remembered that the gentlemen upon the other side were already in the field as mourners, and had pretty much monopolized the business of groaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><persName n="Nestor,,,,," id="n0054.0001.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Nestor,nomatch:0"><surname>Nestor</surname></persName> was with them, and so was Heraclitus; and if the country was to be saved by crying, they were clearly designed to be the saviours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They were angry often enough at finding serious subjects lightly treated, and they did not relish a style which sometimes made havoc of their dignity; but, upon the other hand, it may be said that there were those who did not at all relish their mournful methods, and who could not see that they were taking any very <pb n="xviii"/>promising way to avert the calamities which they predicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But I am sure that there was not a morsel of ill-nature in the criticisms to which they were subjected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>With these considerations, this little volume is presented to the reader, with a hope also, which may be justly expressed, that he will remember the original and temporary purpose of its contents. </p></div1>

<head>Introduction.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>whenever the history of Journalism shall be truly written, <num value="1">one</num> of its most interesting chapters will be that which traces the infancy and growth of that potent creation of our century, the <name>Leader</name> &mdash; that is, of the most important and conspicuous Editorial or Editorials, printed in the largest type, and occupying the most prominent position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I say occupying, though the axiom that <quote>Where <persName n="MacDONALDonald,,,,," id="n0054.0002.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:MacDONALDonald,nomatch:0"><surname>MacDONALDonald</surname></persName> sits is the head of the table,</quote> applies here as well as elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Since the <rs>Electric Telegraph</rs> obtained its full development, the more prominent and interesting dispatches, or the <name>Editorial</name> summary thereof, will probably attract the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glance of a majority of readers; but the <name>Leader</name> soon commands and fixes the attention of all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The Editor is he whose fiat decides what shall and what shall not appear, and in what garb, with what <pb n="xx"/>sanction, complete or qualified, that which does appear shall be presented: he, in many cases, writes but sparingly &mdash; in some, it is said, not at all. Probably, no person likely to be intrusted with the conduct of an influential journal ever supposed himself qualified, even if he had time, to discuss <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the topics which require elucidation in its columns; hence, the engagement of able, intelligent writers to treat of the various themes which, from time to time, invite discussion, aside from those who, in the various departments-Literary, Commercial, Legal, Dramatic, Musical, etc., etc.-hold a more responsible and semiindependent position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The writer of a leading article is often a statesman of wide experience, or a scholar of ripe culture, who volunteers, or, on solicitation, consents, to elucidate a subject of which he is master; sometimes accepting, at others declining, compensation therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>More commonly, however, leading Editorials are written by those who have given their youth to study and their earlier prime to service in the humbler walks of the profession, in which they have developed and perfected the capacities which they now exemplify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They are scarcely a tithe of the number who aspired to the position they have achieved &mdash; the vast majority having failed in the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Liberally compensated and accorded a just <pb n="xxi"/>and wide consideration, they are raised above servility or unworthy complaisance by the consciousness that their widely-recognized talents ensure them employment elsewhere, if that now accorded them should ever be withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The Republic of Letters has few citizens more eligibly placed or more honorably regarded than they.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Some members of this class are men of all work &mdash; ready, at the word of command, to review the most ponderous tome that embodies the latest and least intelligible speculations in <name>German</name> theology or Scotch metaphysics &mdash; to report a masquerade-ball, or to chronicle the latest <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> fashions; but the better, if not more numerous, class do that work only (or mainly) for which they are specially qualified, and to which they are attracted by their studies, or their tastes &mdash; often by both.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>In the protracted, arduous struggle which resulted in the overthrow and extinction of American Slavery, many were honorably conspicuous: some by eloquence; more by diligence; others by fearless, absorbing, single-eyed devotion to the great end; but he who most skillfully, effectively, persistently wielded the trenchant blade of Satire was the writer of the following essays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName>'s <quote><persName n="Biglow,,Hosea,,," id="n0054.0002.00000.00037" reg="default:Biglow,Hosea,,,"><foreName>Hosea</foreName> <surname>Biglow</surname></persName></quote> and <quote>Birdofredum <pb n="xxii"/><persName n="Sawin,,,,," id="n0054.0002.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Sawin,nomatch:0"><surname>Sawin</surname></persName>,</quote> ) were admirable in their way, and did good service to the anti-Slavery cause; but the essays herewith presented, appearing at intervals throughout the later acts of the great drama, and holding up to scorn and ridicule the current phases of pro-Slavery unreason and absurdity, being widely circulated and eagerly read, exerted a vast, resistless influence on the side of Freedom and Humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>There are reprobates so hardened in iniquity as to defy exposure, scout reproof, and meet malediction with contempt; but there was never yet a wrongdoer so callous as to feel indifferent to being laughed at. No tyranny, no outrage, was ever yet panoplied in mail so strong or so close, that the shafts of Satire would not pierce it, and leave their barbs fixed in the quivering flesh beneath.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The papers which follow are a part of the political and social history of the last <num value="12">twelve</num> eventful years which ought to be preserved in a convenient, accessible form &mdash; a part which will be found livelier reading than most History, and hardly less instructive and profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It has been widely asserted that the <name>Editorials</name> of <hi rend="italics">The Tribune</hi> were among the chief incitements to the late <rs>Civil War</rs>. It is well, therefore, that many of the most pungent and exasperating of those Editorials should be collected and published <pb n="xxiii"/>in this volume, so that our children may judge of the provocation they afforded to Secession, and the consequent desperate, bloody struggle for the lasting dismemberment of our Union.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Wit has oftener sped its arrows in the service of Despotism and Oppression than in that of Liberty and Humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The Negro has long been its favorite target; his repulsive color, his uncouth features, his shambling gait, his idiotic merriment, and his grotesque politeness, have all been portrayed and exaggerated in defense of his enslavement, or in ridicule of any attempt to excite sympathy for his sufferings and invoke effort for his deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Never compromising a principle nor truckling to a prejudice, he turned the laugh on the jesters and set the public to mocking the mockers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>While others demonstrated the injustice of manselling, he portrayed its intense meanness, its unspeakable baseness, its monstrous unreason, in colors that even the blind must perceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He drew <num value="2">two</num> figures which no <num value="1">one</num> could help abhorring, and, when <pb n="xxiv"/>all had evinced their irrepressible loathing, he showed the less repulsive to be the <name>Slaveholder</name>, and the other his Northern ally, apologist and champion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Who will say that Screws is not a public benefactor?-a most useful and worthy member of society?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We shall defend Screws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>We see him in his office constantly striving to keep up a full assortment; we see him endeavoring to strengthen himself in the department of <quote>house servants ;</quote> we see him laying in a fresh stock of blacksmiths, or adding to his already large and well-selected <pb id="p.10" n="10"/>collection of field-hands; we see him inditing an advertisement of large and late importations from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, calculated, he trusts, to please the most fastidious taste, both as to quality and price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>This can be no light labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Screws does not get his little profits for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>He has to keep his eye out when the coffle-gang comes in; he must watch the market; he must buy to please the preferences of his customers; he must select healthy parcels; he must be artistic in picking out the pretty packages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>In addition to this, Screws, being naturally a man of tender feelings, is exceedingly harrowed and rasped in the gentler departments of his soul by witnessing painful partings between the goods &mdash; the shrieks of the prime mother; the sobs of the warranted housemaid; the agonies of the <name>Al</name> carpenters and the griefs of the superior blacksmiths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>This renders the business of Screws peculiar; for nobody ever saw <num value="2">two</num> cotton-bales distressed at the idea of parting, and the emotion of separated sugar-boxes is yet to be observed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Screws is in precisely the condition of the softhearted fish-wife, who is obliged to flay the eels alive, or in that of the good-natured butcher, whose customers must have lamb in the season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>But Screws has a public duty to perform, and he performs it. It is a discredit to human nature that, after all these services, Screws should be so shamefully treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>He receives no vote of thanks, no service of ponderous plate, no canes with inscribed heads, no pistols with the gratitude of the donors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The customers of Screws pay him <pb id="p.11" n="11"/>his money, and then instead of asking him to dinner, or to partake of the friendly drink, instead of tenderly squeezing his hand upon parting, they shun him as if he were fever-stricken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>A hard time of it has Screws; and if we could do anything to alleviate his woe, and bring negro-brokerage into good repute, perhaps we would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Unfortunately for Screws, we can not. Society has prejudices which are impregnable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We must, however, try to correct a notion which is totally unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The prevailing impression is that Screws deals altogether in black goods; and these being considered of a low and degraded, although useful kind, the reputation of the business among the genteel has suffered accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>This is all very unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>A gentleman in New Orleans, in writing to his correspondent in New York, says: <quote>If you have any prejudices against buying black carpenters or smiths, Screws can furnish you with white ones, or those who are nearly so.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Our readers will see that Screws deals in white folks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Hie is no mere <quote>nigger</quote> --broker, although with commendable modesty he so writes himself upon his business card.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>In still another department, Screws might be useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>He had commissioned his New York friend to find him <num value="1">one</num>, but Screws almost tempted him to withdraw the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/><quote>From some samples</quote> he writes, <quote>which Screws showed me this morning, I am half inclined to recall my commission to your firm to furnish me with a wife, as I saw <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>or <num value="2">two</num> almost agreeable enough to satisfy even my fastidious taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>But I will not withdraw my commission, as you may supply me without the outlay of so much ready money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Besides, the <num value="2">two</num> ladies I saw were from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and I do not much like the F. F. V.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Here now is an opening for Screws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>He can go into the wife-selling business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>upon further reflection, we remember that he is in it already; nor has it enhanced his respectability a morsel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Well, Screws must struggle on as well as he can; and since he cannot be respectable, must content himself with getting rich, which, no doubt, he will do, unless several of his most valuable parcels should abscond, or a few of his choice samples die of grief or fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Meanwhile, we have endeavored to give him a hoist in the world, for which we have no doubt he will be duly grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>But he need not trouble himself to write us a letter of thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It always gives us pleasure to assist the meritorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>when we parted, in by no means a heart-broken state, with <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00029.00136" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, and settled ourselves to bear as best we might the reign of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00029.00137" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, the general opinion was that we had made a change for the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>There was a notion that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> B. was a more respectable man than his predecessor; or, at any rate, <pb id="p.30" n="30"/>that he would be more forbearing in his treatment of his antagonists, and less likely to do hard, ungenerous and ungracious things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>In fact, despite the little <placeName key="tgn,7007967" n="1.000 2" reg="oostende,west-vlaanderen,vlaanderen,belgie,europe">Ostend</placeName> escapade, <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00030.00138" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> ran very much upon the merits of his respectability and figured in the multitudinous speeches of his champions as a venerable pacificator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It must be confessed that he has done very little in that way thus far. He seems to exhibit rather the querulousness than the placidity of old age. On the contrary, <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00030.00139" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> was particularly polite, and often advanced the most indefensible opinions in language of more than sophomorical elegance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>When at his worst in public policy, he was most dulcet in his demeanor; and he vetoed necessary measures with commendable suavity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/><persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00030.00140" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, we regret to observe, is rather snappish, and too much inclined to snub the humble petitioners who approach the throne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The different characters of the last and of the present <rs>President</rs> may receive illustration from the following facts:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Last <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, when <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00030.00141" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> was about to retire from the presidential glees and glooms, he received from the <orgName n="American Bible Society" type="society">American Bible Society</orgName> a copy of the <rs>Holy Scriptures</rs>, as a token of their high regard for the office which he held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/><quote>We do not know to whom the <name>Society</name> could more appropriately have made the donation than to <num value="1">one</num> who, during his administration of public affairs, was singularly unmindful of many of the teachings of The Book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Uncharitable people might say that <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00030.00142" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>'s case was like that of the man who, upon being asked by a distributor if he had <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>a copy of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, produced <num value="2">two</num> leaves, with the apologetical remark, that he had no idea that he was so <q direct="unspecified">near out.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/></quote></p> 
<p>But in all respects the gift was creditable to the <name>Society</name>, and we hope that it will prove profitable to <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00031.00143" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>A suspicious and touchy man, however, upon receiving it might have resented the presentation as implying a suspicion of his sore need of the instructions of the volume, and of his lack of a copy of it. But <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00031.00144" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> behaved in no such ungracious way. On the contrary, he sat down at once and wrote a charming letter of acknowledgment to the <name>Society</name>, paying the handsomest compliments to the book in particular and to the <rs>Christian</rs> religion in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>To be sure, he said some things in it which rather puzzle us; albeit we suppose that they are perfectly plain to <hi rend="italics">The <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName></hi> and other sheets less benighted than our own. After putting in, as became a sound <orgName n="Constitutional Democrat" type="newspaper">Constitutional Democrat</orgName>, a reminder <quote>that in our political institutions there is no union of Church and State,</quote> <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00031.00145" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> informs us that <quote>Christianity animates our nation; it is the true spirit of good government; it is the characteristic and peculiar quality of modern civilization &mdash; the all-pervading principle of our laws, the sentiment and the moral and social existence of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>This is well expressed; and we are not surprised that it gives our friend <persName n="Forney,,,,," id="n0054.0010.00031.00146" reg="mostcommon:Forney,nomatch:0"><surname>Forney</surname></persName>'s newspaper, from which we copy it, much calm satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>But the ease and accuracy with which it is to be interpreted <pb id="p.32" n="32"/>will depend upon what kind of Christianity <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00032.00147" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> refers to. The truth is that there are several varieties now in vogue; and when presidents write upon theological subjects, they should be careful to let us know to which particular kind they are alluding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>If <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00032.00148" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> in the above elegant extract referred to the new Christianity invented by the <rs>Dr. Rosses</rs>, expounded by <persName n="Brownlows,Reverend,,,," id="n0054.0010.00032.00149" reg="mostcommon:Brownlows,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <surname>Brownlows</surname></persName>, and practically exemplified sometimes behind the <rs>Presbyterian</rs> meeting-house in <placeName reg="Rogersville, Hawkins, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101316">Rogersville, Tenn.</placeName>, why then the meaning of the sentence is as plain as a pike-staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>That <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the <name>Christianity</name> which <quote>animates our nationality,</quote> and is too much <quote>the all-pervading principle of our laws</quote> --a Christianity which does <hi rend="italics">not</hi> let the oppressed go free; but which chases them with blood-hounds, or with the hardly milder myrmidons of the law; a Christianity which, if it does not sanction, fails to rebuke, adultery, cruelty, and <num value="1">one</num> great continuous theft of the earnings of the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>But if <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00032.00150" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> refers to that other Christianity of older date, which inculcates good &mdash; will to man, then we confess that his words are as mysterious to us as if they were written in <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> hieroglyphics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Still this has nothing to do with the manner of the letter which all will admit to be remarkably civil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>How different the style in which <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00032.00151" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> received his present!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Certain gentlemen in <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> remarking with pain that he seemed to be ignorant of the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as well as of his official duties, prepared and sent to him a little memorial, in which some of the simplest of these principles <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>and duties were pointed out in plain language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The donation was not a magnificent <num value="1">one</num>, it must be confessed, and not worth half so much as those big cheeses which it used to be the fashion to present to presidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>But the donors <quote>gave all; they could no more; though poor the offering was.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>That <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0054.0010.00033.00152" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> would have found a study of the paper profitable, we confidently aver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>But instead of devoting himself to it like a good scholar, he ungratefully wrote to the <rs>Connecticut</rs> gentlemen a letter, the burthen of which was, <quote>Thank you for nothing!</quote> --a letter the very opposite of what may be called genial, and as puckery as a persimmon before the frost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Some writer (<persName n="French,,,,," id="n0054.0010.00033.00153" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, of course) says that he prefers bad morals to bad manners; and without going to that extreme, we must say that suavity in a public officer is by no means to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>He had been hurt in his good name.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>the <rs>Southern States</rs> have heretofore known little enough of the <rs>North</rs>; from which we infer that our summer visitors from those regions have either been too intent upon their juleps, or too much engrossed in purchasing merchandize, to carry back for the enlightenment of their stay-at-home neighbors much valuable fruit of intelligent observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>We remember to have met and to have conversed with a clever <name>Yankee</name> woman who undertook to teach the ideas of half a dozen boys and girls to shoot, upon a Virginian plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>So we find at this time the <rs>Southern</rs> newspapers roaring in a fussy and fiery way about <quote>hordes</quote> of Northern <quote>mercenaries</quote> sent to cut the general Southern throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/><quote> A horde,</quote> according to our idea, is a gang of men intent upon plunder; and <quote>hordes</quote> usually go where there is something beside <quote>niggers</quote> to steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/><num value="9">Nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the wealth of the <rs>South</rs> is in fancy human stock; of no particular value to the soldier of fortune &mdash; of no value at all to the patriotic Northern volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>Mercenary, indeed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>These noble soldiers who have just left home and comfort and their loved ones to fight the battle of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, asking no recompense but the consciousness of rectitude &mdash; mercenaries!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>If so, then <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0054.0037.00145.00613" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><surname>Warren</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>, then <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0054.0037.00145.00614" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,Alexander,,,:1"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Schuyler,,,,," id="n0054.0037.00145.00615" reg="mostcommon:Schuyler,nomatch:0"><surname>Schuyler</surname></persName> were mercenaries!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>If so, who would not be a mercenary?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>The men of the <rs>North</rs> know indeed the value of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>They know what it will do; and they know, as Southern rebels will find out to their cost, just the right time to spend it. History hardly records such a profuse, yet enlightened liberality as that which the <rs>Northern States</rs> have exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>It is hardly an exaggeration to say, that the entire wealth of cities and towns, of private corporation and of individuals has been tendered to the <rs>Government</rs> upon its own terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>After all we have given to the sacred cause of Law and Order, we have still a dollar or so left; and can even borrow a little should our present stock fail us. But we have hardly touched the popular pocket yet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>Northern theories of liberty and of human equality seem to be hardening/un&gt; into pretty substantial practice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The tone of the <rs>Southern</rs> newspapers, when speaking of the wealthy, intelligent and patriotic North as <num value="1">one</num> great anarchy, and of the <rs>Northern</rs> people as <quote>a godless mob</quote> of <quote>Puritans, Freelovers, Abolitionists, Mormons, Atheists and Amalgamationists,</quote> has given the gentlemen who have cast away the slave-whip for the sword quite a mistaken notion of our resources as well as of our character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>How far, in the first place, have these hostilities been precipitated merely for the sake of avoiding just pecuniary obligations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>How many men have become big-voiced Secessionists, because their pockets were empty and their promises to pay imminent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>Whatever hoar and antiquated Law, in the person of a perjured <rs type="role2">Chancellor</rs>, may say, the man who rebels in order that he may repudiate, is <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>both a traitor and a swindler, and worthy of the jail should he escape the gibbet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>No: we believe that every honest Southern merchant &mdash; and there must be such &mdash; will pay his debts if he can, and as soon as he can hereafter if he cannot pay them now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>The newspaper press is its own champion aud watchful sentry; and it will take care for that liberty by the tenure of which it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>The task is not, indeed, so hard a <num value="1">one</num> as it was in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> not many years ago, when <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Eldon</foreName></persName> was accustomed to send to Newgate every editor who thought <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0054.0048.00187.00711" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> a better general than the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="York, York, England" key="tgn,7011995">York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>It may happen, indeed, as a matter of mere military policy, that the <rs>Government</rs> may feel <pb id="p.188" n="188"/>compelled, during the existence of actual war, to control the circulation of journals openly in the interest of the enemy; but the right to do this, by no means implies the right to prevent the discussion, in good faith, of any public policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>No Government can be expected to become the common carrier, in a time of extreme danger, of libels aimed at its very life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>But there is an easily perceptible distinction between an attack upon the existence of a Government, and a criticism of its measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>If we are in peril of this we cannot avoid it; for it is a danger incident to our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>But on the other hand, it seems to us that now, when we are asking so much of our citizen-soldiers, it would be the extreme of discourtesy, childishly to suspect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>We have called them from domestic happiness and the ease and safety of peace; we have asked of them the utmost of sacrifices in the greatest of causes; and, luring them only by the gathering cry of loyalty to liberty, we have placed in their hands the ark of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>It is <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>no time for distrust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>It is no time, Heaven knows, in a sneaking spirit of cynical suspicion, to doubt the honor and worthiness of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>When soldiers like ours, Freemen all of them in blood and bone, who never knew a master before, are submitting with hardly a solitary murmur to the extreme rigor of military discipline, it is but fair to presume, that only an indelible and paramount affection for free institutions could have called them to the field, or kept them there.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>We bring to this great trial a sober sense of the value of human liberty, and we strike no blow without a thought of the blessings of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>It is not in such a school as this that we are to unlearn all the lessons of our history; it is not under such influences, that we are to surrender our most creditable prejudices; it is not while we are desperately clinging to the traditions of the <rs>Republic</rs>, that we are to fling ourselves at the feet of a despot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>When foreign nations judge us, we claim something on the score of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>It is grossly unfair, and no better than sheer trifling with historic examples, to predicate our future upon the fate of less enlightened and more turbulent states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>We claim that our social problem is not perplexed by the presence of large masses of hungry and ignorant men, to whom any change may prove, or may seem, a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>Offensive and meaningless nicknames are quite out of place in discussions so grave as these are. The Republicans do not profess to love Slavery-no, nor Slaveholders as such; they do not pretend to devise any patched &mdash; up treaties, or to seek for hollow truces; they would gladly see the cause of this wicked Rebellion vanish with the <rs>Rebellion</rs> itself; they desire not only a present triumph of the laws, but security for the future good behavior of men who have shown themselves to be reckless and desperate; yet, with all their stiffest opinions, and with all their most ardent hopes, they have never dreamed for a moment of transcending Constitutional limits, or of indulging an unworthy revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>All speculations, therefore, which presuppose that any considerable body of the members <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>of our Party can be drawn out of its organization by a predominance in its councils of a moderate policy, are at once absurd and insulting; and so they will be regarded, no matter by whom they may be undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>For this, as for other amiable exhibitions of disinterestedness, we must be prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>A debt created for the defence of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, in the opinion of every intelligent citizen, is a debt created for his own benefit, relief, and prosperity; and those who have freely offered their lives in that great behalf, will hardly turn conspirators and traitors to avoid taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>It is hard to write upon this topic without seeming to boast; but, certainly, if a nation is to be thus gratuitously discredited, it has a right to plead previous good character.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>Until, therefore, we commit an act of insolvency, we beg foreign writers, to whom we owe nothing, to possess their souls in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>We are not utterly deficient in prudence and economy, of the necessity of which we are every day reminded; and he who writes us down fools, before we have proved our incompetency, is himself included in his own accusation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>There is an abiding compensation in all our troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>Through successes and reverses, through doubts and distractions, not less than through encouraging good fortunes, <pb id="p.256" n="256"/>we are making for ourselves an antiquity and a history &mdash; we are consolidating a nationality &mdash; we are storing up precious traditions &mdash; we are, in the midst of war, becoming worthy of the blessings of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>Those who believe that there is nothing for us but a ruinous and irremediable dissolution, must be shamefully ignorant, or contemptibly besotted by spleen and prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>No nation could be more grateful than ours, not for foreign arms taken up in our behalf, but for foreign sympathy; yet if it cannot be ours, without a sacrifice of principle or honor, certainly there is no nation that can better afford to do without it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>The theory of this war is plain enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>The Northern people well understand that they are contending for the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <name>Laws</name>; but it may be questioned if more than a small minority of thinkers have permitted themselves to look &mdash; for they cannot do so without shuddering &mdash; into that seething hell of anarchy and confusion and ceaseless apprehension which would be our fate in the event of a Confederate triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>Large as this continent is, it may be safely assumed that it is not large enough for <num value="2">two</num> distinct nationalities, with natural limits ill defined, with military ambition upon <num value="1">one</num> side of the line, and with a tantalizing opulence upon the other, and with reminiscences of success taunting continually a stern, sad memory of defeat; while a common language, instead of promoting peaceful alliances, would become merely a more convenient medium of debate and defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>If we never knew it before, we know now, that Slavery is aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>It is unnecessary to say that it is more so than any other marked and distinctive <pb id="p.289" n="289"/>form of social life would be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>For reasons which we need not recapitulate, a component part of that defence must be its extension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>It can no more exist within confined limits than a rat can live under an exhausted receiver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>It is clear, therefore, that in the event of a military triumph of the system, the spirit of territorial aggrandizement, which has heretofore sought for new man-markets upon the frontier of the <rs>Southwest</rs>, would begin to exert itself in a Northern direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>If we know anything of the temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, we can hardly believe that they will be ready to do that of their free &mdash; will which they have been so unwilling to do upon compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>Treaties might be made, but treaties would be perpetually broken.
