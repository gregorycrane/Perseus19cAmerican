<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>So great was the crowd, that, in anticipation of the arrival of the wounded, it was deemed necessary by the committee appointed to receive them to set a strong guard to prevent the pressure of the people around the train when it should arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>my dear day: The accounts which you read in the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName> about the great battle which has just come off, are not in the least exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>I could never have contemplated that such a terrible disaster would have befallen the <rs>Northern</rs> arms.

<head>Incidents of the retreat after the panic was stopped.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>* * we were comforting ourselves with <quote>an old oaken bucket which hung by a well</quote> near the fence: the rather cross-looking Virginian occupant of the house eyeing us not quite amiably from his passive position on the door-step, when some of the straggling soldiers, who had eluded the <name>Jerseymen</name> probably by leaping the fences, began to show themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>Many of them were sound in body, but apparently fagged out. Most of them were wholly unarmed; some in shirt-sleeves, and without coats or hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Many were more or less wounded: <num value="1">one</num> hit on the forehead, another in the neck, another in the leg, (none badly wounded could have limped so far on foot,) and a few were from the hospital, sick and hardly able to stand up. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> word of all of them was: <quote>Water!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Is there any water here?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>They all said they had eaten nothing since yesterday, nor tasted a drop of liquid, save only the muddy water of puddles by the road-side; yet they had been all day long in the hardest of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Doubtful this, perhaps, in some cases, but probably true of the <rs>Ellsworth Zouaves</rs>, of whom about a dozen were visible, all apparently worn out with work of the hardest kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>(No other New York men were seen by us during the night.) Their stories of charges in the <quote>imminent deadly breach</quote> of masked batteries, would have been less credible if they had not been <hi rend="italics">individual</hi>, just from the field, and with no chance for <hi rend="italics">mutual</hi> buncombe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/><quote>We've lost half our men,</quote> more than <num value="1">one</num> of them said, perhaps honestly; but the sequel was <quote>not so:</quote> perhaps <num value="100">one hundred</num> were left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/><quote>We've been badly cut up,</quote> said <num value="1">one</num> from another quarter; <quote>the New York <num value="71" type="ordinal">71st</num> are half cut to pieces;</quote> and so they talked, <num value="1">one</num> after the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Revived with a long tug at our nectar and ambrosia in the old bucket, which was vigorously rolled up and down on its iron chain, they rested, washed, breathed long and well, and trudged on toward <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/><num value="1">One</num> poor fellow, a slender youth of <num value="18">eighteen</num>, too tender altogether for a working army, panted up to the well and seemed too weak to hold himself up. <quote>I was sick in the hospital,</quote> said he; <quote>they fired into it and killed several there, and I had to run as well as I could.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>I omitted to take his name, poor fellow; it would be comfortable to know he reached home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>So we pulled the bucket up and down, thankful that in this easy way we could give aid and comfort to these panting, thirsty, fagged defenders of their country's flag, and never doubting they had honestly done their best.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Meanwhile, an army-wagon had been standing since we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met the panic in the same spot before this house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>I note this particular wagon, lettered <quote><orgName type="company" n="Company H">Co. H</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="ME3">3d Regt., Me.</orgName>,</quote> because it is noteworthy that it stood in line in <num value="1">one</num> place all these <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>; and the driver said, in answer to my question, that he <quote>should move on as soon as he had orders.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>As this is the regiment of <persName n="Howard,Colonel,,,," id="n0073.0065.00020.00314" reg="mostcommon:Howard,William,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West-Point</placeName>, whom I (as <num value="1">one</num> of those <quote>reception committees</quote> ) had learned to respect and admire in New York, I talked with the teamster about the doings of the day and of the <rs>Colonel</rs>, who was reported killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>During the brief panic, he had, like his neighbors, thrown overboard all his cargo, except <measure n="5bags" type="mass">five bags</measure> of oats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>So, on these bags we persuaded him to spread <num value="6">six</num> of the wounded soldiers, to be jolted over the road, in the absence of ambulances, which at this place at least were invisible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>When he finally started homeward, with the rest of the teams, about <num value="7">seven</num>, or near sunset, the line having been ordered to <quote>move on,</quote> there was still room for us in a corner; but soon other wounded soldiers were over-taken, and we boosted them into our places and look to our feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>During the few minutes we were in the wagon a new panic was raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>The stragglers in the road suddenly scampered over the fences to the woods, and the teamsters whipped their horses into a furious run for some <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>, the dust flying so thickly that we could scarcely see each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea naturally pointed to the <rs>Black</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="CavCav">Horse Cavalry</orgName>, who must be cutting us off!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>It was now nearly dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The <num value="2">two</num> muskets still left among our <measure n="6" type="wounded">six wounded</measure> companions were quickly <hi rend="italics">in rest</hi> for a shot at the enemy; but a moment more disclosed a couple of platoons ahead, stopping every thing on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>These quickly proved to be a detachment of our <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName> <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> from <placeName reg="Fairfax Court House">Fairfax Court House</placeName>, sent forward to head off all sound-bodied fugitives and send them back to their regiments: hence the scamper over the fences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Only by this manoeuvre could any soldiers pass the <num value="2">two</num> reserves and reach the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>On the road every man was stopped and turned back, excepting the wounded and the teamsters with their wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>As to the civilians, they had long ago disappeared on the safe side; we saw but <num value="1">one</num> beside ourselves after sunset, until we reached the pickets near the <rs type="place">Court House</rs>, about <time value="9pm">nine o'clock P. M.</time> Here again, returning soldiers were still stopped and turned back at this time, and as late, certainly, as <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, or <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> after the retreat began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Could a couple of platoons turn back a whole army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The wagons rolled slowly into the village, and for an hour, or more, I noticed the team of our friend of <quote><orgName type="company" n="Company H">Co. H</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="ME3">3d Regt., Me.</orgName>,</quote> being in its place in the line, still standing quietly opposite the <rs type="place">Court House</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>The contents of my friend's haversack had been <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>nearly exhausted, in bits given to the hungry men from the battle; so we thought a little supper would not be amiss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>The tavern, an average specimen of <num value="0.2">a <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num></num>-rate village-inn, yet claiming a higher grade, probably, as the hostelry of the <rs type="place">County Court</rs>, stands right opposite the <rs type="place">Court House</rs>, on the main road to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The teatable was still uncleared, and cold meat yet remained for the wayfarer; so we took seats without question, and a couple of colored servants presently brought us some fresh tea and coffee &mdash; such as they were &mdash; and even took pains to bake us a warm blackberry-cake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>(These trivialities are only recorded as obvious indications of a <hi rend="italics">deliberate</hi> state of things, rather than of a race from an enemy.) While we sipped our tea, a stranger joined us, saying calmly, by way of introduction: <quote>My son has been wounded in the battle; I've just brought him here &mdash; wish I could get him something that would taste like tea.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>We left him, sending an earnest message to the landlady: <quote>Would pay any thing she pleased.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>A youth of <num value="20">twenty</num>, civil and gentlemanly in manner, here appeared to represent the house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/><quote>How much is our supper, sir?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/><quote><measure n="25cents" type="currency">Twenty-five cents</measure> each.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>This moderate demand thankfully paid, I remarked: <quote>Probably you have no beds to give us?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/><quote>Yes, sir, I think I have.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>We could scarcely expect <hi rend="italics">this</hi> comfort, for the house is small, and strangers rather abounded just now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/><quote>Thank you; we'll look about a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Pray keep the room for us.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Among the groups of talkers about the door, we noticed a decisive and emphatic-looking gentleman who was addressed by another as <persName n="Wade,Senator,,,," id="n0073.0065.00021.00315" reg="mostcommon:Wade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>He was reviewing sone of the day's incidents, and I afterward learned he had, with his friends, done excellent service in stopping part of the panic and stampede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Civilians were not all useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> seemed to be intending a return to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> next morning; and meanwhile proposed to his friends to rest comfortably in their carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>This was about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>; wagons still at rest; as many soldiers about the place as I had seen at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, but here and there a poor fellow would come in from battle-ward inquiring for the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Every thing warranted an off-hand verification of my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression &mdash; that is, that the army had rested and would stay at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, and the wagons and stragglers would stay here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Even this scarcely seemed worth asking: we didn't imagine any thing else.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>About <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> our civil young host politely lighted us to a very good room, in which was a nice double-bed and a single cot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/><quote>We shall leave early; we'll pay for the room now, if you please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>How much?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/><quote><measure n="25cents" type="currency">Twenty-five cents</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>But I may have to disturb you, gentlemen, to put some <num value="1">one</num> in that other bed, for you see we are cramped for room.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/><quote> Certainly; we hardly expected a bed ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>We'll lock the door, but any <num value="1">one</num> you send shall be admitted.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/><quote>Good-night, gentlemen.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/><quote>Good-night, sir.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Much less courteous hosts are to be found in our own <name>Yankee</name> laud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>By the way, the urgent message of the father of the wounded soldier had finally produced the landlady, a tall, straight specimen of a Virginia dame, lofty-capped, stately, and somewhat cross; and I couldn't blame her, under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>I hope she produced her best Oolong, if not her Gunpowder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>We undressed, and were soon comfortably stowed in the ample large bed, not omitting our thanks to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for our preservation, yet not very deeply impressed with a sense of escaping any peculiar danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>As we lay talking of the day's events, the expected knock came, and our young host introduced an officer in uniform to occupy the other bed. He proved to be a Pennsylvanian, who had been only a spectator in the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>He told us of the death of <persName n="Cameron,Colonel,,,," id="n0073.0065.00021.00316" reg="mostcommon:Cameron,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>, and of several incidents of the day. We talked to each other across the room for some <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, and then <quote>tired nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep,</quote> overtook us all. At any rate, when I rose at <time value="1:30">half-past 1</time>, both my companion and the officer were as <quote>sound as a top.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>I had for an hour noticed confused talking of soldiers under our open window, and more arrivals seemed apparent; but the only order I heard was: <quote><orgName type="regiment" key="WI2">Second Wisconsin</orgName>, fall in!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/><quote>T----,</quote> said I, <quote>I think you'd better wake up. It's a moonlight night, and walking will be more comfortable than in the day-time; beside, I want to reach <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> early, and we can catch the <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> boat from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Rather reluctantly (for he was very tired) my friend got up: and we were comfortably dressed and in the road between <time value="2">two</time> and <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>. Our room-mate from the <rs>Keystone State</rs> we left sound asleep, for we had no authority to disturb him. If <quote>this meets his eye,</quote> will he send a word to say whether he woke up in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The night was pleasantly cool; and clouds and road lighted up by a full moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Road fair but sandy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The wagons were plodding on in continuous line; but that they were not much hurried or disordered, is evident from our soon overtaking our old friend of <quote><orgName type="company" n="Company H">Co. H</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">3d Regt.</orgName>, me.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>The road was about as sparingly sprinkled with stray soldiers as it was the other side of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, and in all we probably saw <num value="500">five hundred</num>, not more, between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> panic in the road, and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Many of these were lying in groups, asleep, by the roadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Frequently, <num value="2">two</num> would be together on a heavy wagon-horse without saddle; several, slightly disabled, had climbed into the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/><num value="2">Two</num> poor fellows I noticed together on a tired horse, looking the very picture of exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The expression on the face of <num value="1">one</num> of them I cannot forget: he looked sick, and his eyes rolled in a despairing manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>I tried to cheer him, saying he would soon be in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, well cared for. He could only answer by what seemed a thankful smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>T----and I tried to talk to as many different soldiers as we could reach, and to learn all they had to say. Their stories of the barbarities of the rebels to the wounded were too many and too varied to leave any doubt that <quote>No quarter</quote> was the watchword of at least a portion of the rebel army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>I might repeat a dozen of these sad incidents, showing how disabled and wounded men were butchered; but the theme is sickening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>For the sake of humanity, of common decency, let us hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>that this barbarity was limited and local, and was condemned by the commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>We since know, that <hi rend="italics">after</hi> the battle they did take care of our wounded, and treat them well: let all justice be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/><pb id="p.22" n="22"/></p> 
<p>Almost every man we tallied with belonged to a different regiment from the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>They were chiefly from <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>--I did not see any soldiers from <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>--<placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, New York, or <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>; but of course I speak only of our part of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Their accounts seemed to harmonize, especially in <num value="2">two</num> points, namely, that our men held their ground sturdily until <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>; and whenever they came in actual contact with the rebels, they drove them back; and secondly, that many of our officers were grossly inefficient, and some evidently showed the white feather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Orders seemed to be scarce; <quote>the men fought on their own hook.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Several, however, spoke of the gallant young <persName n="Sprague,Governor,,,," id="n0073.0065.00022.00317" reg="mostcommon:Sprague,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Sprague</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, and said he behaved heroically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/><quote>It was the movement of a <orgName type="mil" key="RIBattery">Rhode Island battery</orgName> from the range of shells, to a new position, yet in perfect order, which started at least a part of the false panic and cry of <q direct="unspecified"> Retreat.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The Fire Zouaves had made some terrific charges; but as they would rush headlong on <num value="1">one</num> masked battery, and capture it, they were decimated by another battery concealed in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Late in the day, these sturdy fellows received a charge of the famous Black <orgName type="mil" key="CavCav">Horse Cavalry of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></orgName>, who were sent reeling back with half their saddles vacant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>The greatest mistake on our side was want of cavalry ; the next was, making us fight on empty stomachs, tired out, and without any water to taste except mud-puddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>As it was, the rebels were beaten and were falling back, when that panic was started at the last moment.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Such, almost literally, were the words of these men from different parts of the field, and before they could have compared notes among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Toward daybreak, we came up with a drove of <num value="40">forty</num> cattle, belonging to the army, which had been driven back with the returning wagons all the way; and we took some extra exercise, chasing a bullock or <num value="2">two</num>, straying off into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>I think we saved our <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName></persName> <num value="1">one</num> stout animal, and fairly earned a beefsteak, which is hereby freely waived in behalf of privates A and B, who are probably as hungry as we. As day dawned, we caine up with a female equestrian, probably a nurse, who walked her horse leisurely by the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Soon we observed camps near the road, over which waved the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>; the ramparts of <placeName key="tgn,2036580" n="1.000 1" reg="kanopolis, ellsworth, kansas">Fort Ellsworth</placeName> on a hill commanding the road into <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, were occupied by men, busy apparently in placing their guns in range; and at the outer picket near the town, another platoon from the garrison were <quote>arguing the point</quote> with fugitive soldiers who were asking admittance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Even at this time only the wagons and the disabled men seemed to be allowed to pass: able-bodied soldiers were very properly stopped outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Our <hi rend="italics">pass</hi> was promptly honored as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chance for a cup of coffee &mdash; a decent negro family in a <hi rend="italics">barnish</hi>-looking house, where cakes were spread to tempt stray pennies from soldier-boys and others &mdash; we had a nice hot breakfast, without a single allusion to the event of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>From the positions of our forces, it will be perceived, that after our repulse on the afternoon of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, if we had had <num value="5">five</num> fresh regiments in addition to <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Blenker,Colonel,,,," id="n0073.0071.00025.00370" reg="nearbymention:Blenker,Louis,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Blenker</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which, however, did not reach the field of battle in time to afford any relief, and an additional force of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> <pb id="p.26" n="26"/>regiments with a battery behind <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> on the road to <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, and in the rear of the wagons, the field would have been saved, for there is no doubt the rebels were stunned by the force of our charges and the extent of their losses, which must have been comparatively much heavier than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>This is almost conclusive, from the fact that they did not pursue in any considerable body, supposing us, undoubtedly, to be occupying the ground at <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> in sufficient force to maintain ourselves, and following out their apparently settled policy of keeping behind their intrenchments, and risking nothing in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>I omitted to state yesterday, as another proof of the confidence which <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0073.0071.00026.00371" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> appears to have felt in the success of the attack, that while the engagement was going on, say at <time value="3:30">3 1/2 o'clock</time>, in addition to the army wagons with which the <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> road was encumbered, there were <num value="6">six</num> wagons heavily loaded with oak timber, about midway between <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> and the <quote>run,</quote> intended for rebuilding the bridge which the rebels had undermined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was abandoned on the road before the retreat commenced, the horses being unable to draw it up the hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>These multiplied incumbrances, in such unusual and unnecessary situations, added greatly to the confusion; for teamsters with only whips in their hands can hardly be expected to preserve the steadiness of troops on the field.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>I ought to say here, in justice to the few civilians who went to this extreme post, and who, within my personal observation, sought by every possible effort to rally the men; that the very officer on horseback who brought us the message to <persName n="Blenker,,,,," id="n0073.0071.00026.00374" reg="nearbymention:Blenker,Louis,,,"><surname>Blenker</surname></persName>, was afterwards overtaken by us, far ahead of the troops, riding leisurely to the rear on the <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>I confidently believe that there was a repulse, after the almost superhuman exertions of our men, who had been fighting on empty stomachs, by fresh cavalry; and I think it will be found that a retreat had been ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>It was not a panic of baggage wagons, or civilians; or if it was, if the wagons had been in the rear of <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> and properly supported, there would have been no panic at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The reason why I conclude that a retreat had been ordered, is, that on our approach to <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0073.0071.00026.00375" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> was leading his reserves across the road, and to a position where he could make a stand, either to cover the retreat of his advanced corps, or to resist a cavalry attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Simultaneously with this movement a large drove of cattle had come up on the side of the road, and from being pressed forward as they had been towards the <quote>run,</quote> were immediately headed to the rear, and driven at a rapid rate back over the road which they had just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>This could not have taken place without orders, and was before the stampede of tho wagons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>The conclusion of all this is, that the battle ought not to have been fought under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>If <persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n0073.0071.00026.00376" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> had been content to intrench himself at <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName>, of which he seems to have had some intention, for his men were at work upon an intrenchment which was not occupied, a successful day would have come for us, and our troops would have been saved from the demoralizing influence, not of defeat, but of a disorganization and retreat almost unparalleled, considering the comparatively short distance, for fatigue and suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Having been separated from the wagons, the men were necessarily without food.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>We rode out of the stable yard shortly after the rush of wagons commenced; we did this for the purpose of getting out of the way of the movements of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>There were then ahead of us at least <num value="100">one hundred</num> to <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> wagons, with <num value="4">four</num> horses to each, and half as many behind, rushing down the road like a torrent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>We got wedged in among them, and were obliged to follow or be crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>Ahead of us was <num value="1">one</num> containing a soldier wounded in the foot, which a comrade beside him was holding up and trying to keep from being hurt by the movements of the wagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Another wounded soldier clung upon the back of our carriage for a considerable distance, until we were able to place him on <num value="1">one</num> of the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Soon tho drivers commenced throwing out the contents of their wagons, until the road was filled with bags of grain, boxes, coils of rope, shovels, pickaxes, and every imaginable thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Over all this litter we were obliged to drive, with no chance to turn out, there being a constant pressure behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>The truth should be shown, whatever the consequences; but libels on our whole army, after the noble stand and heroic service done that day, are more than wicked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>They deserve all credit for this important service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>To show how effectual it was, I need only repeat that <persName n="Tilley,Mister,,,," id="n0073.0079.00029.00412" reg="nearbymention:Tilley,H.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tilley</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, and myself, remained till <time value="6:30oclock">half-past 6 o'clock</time> at the very spot where the stampede was stopped, where we had the melancholy satisfaction of aiding with a cup of pure water the wounded and sick men who came limping from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>The whole panic was stopped in <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>. It was causeless and disgraceful during this time and at the place where it occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The day was lost by it; but, as far as the retreat or flight was concerned, it was stopped within <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, and in less time than it takes to write about it.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/><quote>The baggage wagons, by the <num value="100">hundred</num>, were stationed on a hill, in view of a large body of the army engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>A park of our artillery was ordered to the ground occupied by these teams, and the teamsters were ordered to leave the ground as fast as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>They took the order for an alarm, and began to drive wildly from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>The civilians in the same neighborhood took flight along with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>The troops saw this, and a brigade, being in motion to take up a new position, mistook the movement for a flight or retreat, or converted the movement into a retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Then commenced the panic, and it quickly became a sea of confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The battle was a grand victory up to this time, and it stands at that yet, notwithstanding the retreat, for there were <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> of our troops on the field that were not brought into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>The burden of the day, from <time value="8am">8 in the morning</time> till <time value="6pm">6 in the evening</time>, was borne by unrelieved troops, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them without their breakfast, and all without food, except a cracker or <num value="2">two</num> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>This seems to be a great blunder; but where the fault lies, it is difficult to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>There is nothing suspicious about it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>He calls again, and with the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>He saw between <num value="2">two</num> seats a small basket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>The top was partly raised and discovered some sandwiches, gingerbread, etc. It was of course nothing surprising to see a luncheon basket in the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>The conductor came up and said, <quote><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, an old woman owns that basket; I believe she has stepped into the forward car.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>Well, that was very reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>However, just as he was going to leave it, the <rs>Colonel</rs> put his little finger under the handle, to see how much a basket of luncheon weighs, you know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>But the thing didn't come up. Somehow it stuck to the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>He then applied his whole hand, and after removing the gingerbread, he discovered about half a peck of bright brass buttons, which were on their way to adorn the uniforms of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>A few stoutly maintain their former views, and are entitled to credit for a degree of courage, which, if manifested by the rebel troops, would have left that town, a week ago to-day, the scene of fearful slaughter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>Our forces, and other eye-witnesses of the affair, declare that the rebels were in too great a hurry about taking to their heels to wait for any such perilous ceremony as putting on their clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>On receiving the flag, the captain had made a gallant speech, assuring the bewitching donors that it should lead him and his company ever to victory or death; that where the battle was thickest, there it should wave; that it should never trail dishonored in the mire; that rather would he spill his life's blood in its defence, and, dying, wrap his body in its gorgeous folds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>When that unmannerly cannon-ball from the <orgName n="Cleveland Artillery" type="artillery">Cleveland artillery</orgName> on the hill came crashing through the camp, this heroic captain forgot all about the flag he had so gallantly received the night before, and led the column &mdash; out of danger, as fast as their legs could carry them!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>A feeling of uneasiness began to creep over me; I was on the outskirt of a wood fringing the dark waters at my feet, whose presence could scarcely be detected but for their sullen murmurs as they rushed through the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>In the agony of that moment &mdash; in the sudden and utter helplessness I felt to discover my true bearings &mdash; I was about to let myself gently into the stream, and breast its current, for life and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>With <num value="1">one</num> dart the light skiff was yards out in the stream, and the savage after it. With an oar I aimed a blow at his head, which, however, he eluded with ease.
