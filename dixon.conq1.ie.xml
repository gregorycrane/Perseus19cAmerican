<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Ruins! A pile of stone, standing in a country of mud-tracks, adobe ranches, and timber-sheds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Yes, broken dome, projecting rafter, crumbling wall, and empty chancel, open to the wind and rain, poetic wrecks of what, in days gone by, have been a cloister and a church.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>A wide and ragged field, enclosed within a fence of sun-dried bricks, surrounds the fane, marking the sacred precincts with a dark and perishing line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>No human form is seen, no human voice is heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>An owl, disturbed in her siesta, lifts her brow and hoots; a lizard hisses through the weeds; a catamount, unused to tramp of horse and bark of dog, deserts her hole and darts into the bush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Near by, the ocean laps in measured tones along <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> a sandy beach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>A cry of gulls and cormorants, rising from a rock below the cliff, is answered by a yell of sea-lions, fighting for their mates; but these mysterious voices from the depths of nature seem to feed the silence, and make the solitude complete.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Rein up, and scan the scene; a dip in the <rs type="place">Pacific coast</rs>, between the heights of Monte Toro and the <rs>Pinal Grande</rs>; a scene to soothe the eye with physical beauty and surprise the ear with sacred and familiar names.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>A spur runs out from the sierra towards the ocean, covered with pines and oaks, until the ridge breaks over the waters in a frown of rocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Some Spanish pilgrim called that spur Carmelo Range, the sheltered nook below the bluff <placeName reg="Carmelo Bay">Carmelo Bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The peak in front of Final <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Grande</placeName> is Monte Carmelo, and the foremost headland on the coast <placeName reg="Carmelo Point">Carmelo Point</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>North of this sacred spur, but running side by side, a tamer spur drops down from Monte Toro; falling with a gentler slope and clothed in softer woods; a spur on which laurel and madrone take the place of pine and oak. <pb id="p.3" n="3"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A glen divides these spurs, through which descends a stream, answering to the <name>Kishon</name> in Galilee, and called by the old pilgrim <placeName reg="Rio Carmelo">Rio Carmelo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Lovely as a painter's vision is this glen; here, hollow ground and dripping well; there, ledge of rock and slope of sward; and here again, gardenlike copse and musical cascade; each nook commanding a view over cypress knoll, bright stream, green down, and blue illimitable sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Nestling in a hollow at our feet, half hidden by the forest growths, yet with an out-look over ridge and ocean, lie the broken stones and falling rafters of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName>, a Franciscan church, built by Red men, natives of the country, acting under a company of Spanish friars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These friars, heralds of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Conquest,,White,,," id="n0160.0001.00003.00001" reg="default:Conquest,White,,,"><foreName>White</foreName> <surname>Conquest</surname></persName> of the <name>Slope</name>, brought into this corner of the earth the torch of Gospel light, hoping to convert and save some remnants of a savage and neglected tribe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Hitching our mustangs to a pine, and bidding our dogs keep watch, we vault the fence of sundried bricks, and feel our feet within the sacred courts; as sacred in this hour of ruin, as when cross and pyx were carried round these walls by holy men, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and angelus and vesper swelled from the choir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The soil is black, the odour aromatic; for at every step, you tread on thyme and sage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Sweet herbs and grasses make their home along these shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Not long ago, the site now covered by the banks and wharves of <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>, was known as <placeName reg="Alcatraz, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7015161">Yerba Buena</placeName>, otherwise Good Herb, the <rs>Spanish</rs> name for mint; and yet these court-yards of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName> are deserted wastes, choked up with briars, and scratched by catamounts into deep and treacherous holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Along the outer fence stand wrecks of school and bastion, hut and hospital, as desolate as a heap of ruins on the <rs type="place">Sea of Galilee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Blocks in which the Red-skins lodged and the <rs>Christian</rs> fathers prayed, stand open to the sky, hedged in by weeds, and overgrown with grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Some hundreds of natives lived within this fence, yet nothing but these heaps of dust and earth remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Adobe walls soon melt away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The summer sun is frying them to dust; the winter rain is washing them to earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Each zephyr steals some grains of loam and drops them over wood and field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Ere long, lovers of the past will seek for them in vain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The stone pile may stand a few years longer than <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> the earthen fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName> is a church of poor materials, put together in the crude though showy <placeName key="tgn,7005560" n="1.000 10" reg="Mexico,North and Central America">Mexican</placeName> style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>No beauty feeds the eye. No magic clothes a gateway; no enchantment lurks in shaft and skyline; yet a sacred edifice is always solemn, and a broken arch affects our feelings like the epitaph on a friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The pathos of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName> lies in the fact of its being the ruin of an <name>Indian</name>'s church.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>No door impedes our entrance to the nave, no rail prevents our passage to the altar-steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A portion of the roof still rests on solid beams; the rest has fallen in, and helped to choke up nave and chancel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No <num value="1">one</num> seems to care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Starting the squirrels from their holes, the night birds from their nests, we pick our way from stone to stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>A chapel stands near the gate, and a door within the chancel opens into a sacristy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Some mural paintings still remain on wall and vault; such painted scrolls and pious messages as you read in village churches of Castille.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A door, now rotting into dust, conceals the sacristy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Closed by a wooden peg, this door suggests that some poor soul still cares for the old place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Yes, some <num value="1">one</num> cares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A Rumsen chief, old <persName n="Carlos,,Capitan,,," id="n0160.0001.00006.00003" reg="default:Carlos,Capitan,,,"><foreName>Capitan</foreName> <surname>Carlos</surname></persName>, comes in once a year, to smooth the falling stones and keep his memory of the church alive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>On pushing the door ajar, a ray of light, a rush of air, go with us into the sacristy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The floor is mud. A broken table leans against the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Above this table hang some poor oil pictures, in the <rs>Spanish</rs> school of sacred art; a faded Sefora of Carmelo, and by way of balance, a yet more faded <persName n="Christo,,Jesu,,," id="n0160.0001.00006.00004" reg="default:Christo,Jesu,,,"><foreName>Jesu</foreName> <surname>Christo</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Covered by dust and grime lie votive offerings of the village sort; among the heaps, a bunch of forest leaves, and a chaplet of paper flowers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>All sorts of creeping things defile the floor and wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The room smells moist and mouldy; so we turn our faces towards the chancel, leaving our <rs type="role" reg="Lady">Lady</rs> of Carmelo in the gloom, and shutting the door on spiders, centipedes, forest leaves, and artificial flowers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This chancel has a purer interest than the sacristy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><pb id="p.7" n="7"/> Here stood the shrine, and here the sacred lamps were lit. Some scraps of monkish art still light the walls; poor chequers, lozenges, and flaming hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Like other savages, the <name>Rumsen</name> of Carmelo had to learn religion through the sense of sight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The Cross has fallen down.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Inside the church, but near the door, some stakes are driven into the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>These stakes are stems of pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><num value="1">One</num> stake has just been driven into the earth; a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> has been snapt by falling stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Who plants these stems of pine in holy soil?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Here lies the mystery of that aged chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Each stake betrays an Indian grave, and tells the story of a lost cause and vanishing race. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Though friar and priest have left the altars of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName> to the owls and lizards, some of the converts whom these fathers gathered into grace are staunch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>A squad of Mexicans, armed with writs and rifles, drove out Fray <persName n="Maria,,Jose,,," id="n0160.0002.00008.00006" reg="default:Maria,Jose,,,"><foreName>Jose</foreName> <surname>Maria</surname></persName>, chief of the <name>Carmelo</name> friars; but neither writs nor rifles have been able to drive off <quote> Capitan</quote> <persName><foreName>Carlos</foreName></persName>, patriarch of the <name>Carmelo</name> camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Yielding to force, Fray <persName n="Maria,,Jose,,," id="n0160.0002.00008.00008" reg="default:Maria,Jose,,,"><foreName>Jose</foreName> <surname>Maria</surname></persName> went to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, where he has learned to serve another altar, and ceased to think of his mission on <placeName reg="Carmelo Bay">Carmelo Bay</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This <name>Indian</name> patriarch claims to be a <measure n="125years" type="date">hundred and twenty-five years</measure> old. Such claims are not uncommon in this zone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>In every ranch you hear of centenarians, and in many convent registers you read of folk having lived to <num value="6">six</num>-score years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Such tales and records are not always false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The air is mild, the eating good, the life unvexed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>No burning summers parch the skin, no freezing winters chill the blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>From month to month the seasons come and go in <num value="1">one</num> soft round of spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>In winter it is <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>, in summer it is only <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A native piques himself on length of days; a big chief wearing his crown of age like <num value="1">one</num> of the big trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>From his appearance, no <num value="1">one</num> could pretend to guess the patriarch's age; for though his eye is quick, his scalp is bare and black, his cheeks are hollowed into cups, his skin hangs down his face in flaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Life seems to hold him only by a thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><pb id="p.10" n="10"/> In summer time he dawdles in the woods; in winter time he hangs about the farms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Being known to every settler, he is sure of bite and sup. His hands can bait a snare and throw a hatchet; yet the poor old fellow is so much a savage, he would rather beg than steal, and rather steal than work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Aged, but not venerable, he loafs in front of whisky bars, and fawns on strangers for a drink; his thirst for ardent waters being the only appetite that seems to have outlived his <num value="6">six</num>-score years and <num value="5">five</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>You take the <rs>Indian</rs> as he is &mdash; a wreck and waste of nature, even as this altar of <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName> is a wreck and waste of art. For <measure n="20cents" type="currency">twenty cents</measure>, laid out in whisky, you may hear the story of his life, and in that tale the romance of his tribe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>A youth when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Spaniards came to <placeName reg="Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico" key="tgn,7007115">Monterey</placeName>, <persName n="Carlos,,Capitan,,," id="n0160.0002.00010.00010" reg="default:Carlos,Capitan,,,"><foreName>Capitan</foreName> <surname>Carlos</surname></persName> saw Fray <persName n="Serra,,Junipero,,," id="n0160.0002.00010.00011" reg="default:Serra,Junipero,,,"><foreName>Junipero</foreName> <surname>Serra</surname></persName> land his company of friars, <persName n="Rivera,,Don,Jose,," id="n0160.0002.00010.00012" reg="default:Rivera,Don,Jose,,"><foreName>Don</foreName> <foreName>Jose</foreName> <surname>Rivera</surname></persName> land his regiment of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The <rs>Spaniards</rs> had already built a Mission house at <placeName reg="San Diego, San Diego, California" key="tgn,7014455">San Diego</placeName>, and were creeping upward towards the <rs>Golden Gate</rs>; but no Carmelo Indian had as yet beheld a White man's face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The fathers raised a cross; the troops unfurled a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A psalm was sung, a cannon fired; rites, as they said, <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> which gave the people to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the country to the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>These strangers built a castle on the hill, above the spot on which they had raised their cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>They fenced that castle round about with walls, on which they mounted guns, and set a watch by day and night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Like all their brethren of the <name>Slope</name>, the <rs>Red</rs> men were a tame and feeble folk; munching acorns as they fell, grubbing in the soil for roots, and wading in the pools for fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Some bolder spirits chased the fox and trapped the catamount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The bucks were fond of skins, but skins were only to be got by daring deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>No man, unless a chief, had other clothing than a wrap about his loins, a feather in his hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="20">twenty</num> had so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The squaws were all but naked; their summer suit being an apron made of tule grass, their winter suit a wrap of half-dried skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Papooses, whether male or female, wore no dress at all. A sense of shame was no more present in a native lodge than in a colony of seals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>These timid savages lived in hutches built of straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Herding in the woods like deer, they seldom washed, I I <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> and never combed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>A little paint was all the unguent they desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>A squaw tattooed her chin, her neck, her breast; a buck put on his face a dab of paint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They fed on grubs and worms, on roots and berries, living from hand to mouth, not caring for the morrow's meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>All things were held by them in common, like the grass and water in a sheep-run, but the sweetest morsels and the warmest skins were taken by the seers and chiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>They saved no roots, they dug no wells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Old legends told them of a time when their fathers lived in towns, and they had still a village system, with a show of ancient rule and right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They chose a chief and made him pope and king.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>This chief had a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> choice of squaws; and took as many as his hutch would hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Catching them when he liked, he flung them from him when he liked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>An <name>Indian</name> female had no rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Poor souls, they knew no better in those pagan days, before <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName> sent his message to their tribe!</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>A cross appeared to be the <rs>White</rs> man's totem; for beside a great cross borne aloft, each father wore <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> a small cross at his belt; which he raised and pressed to his lips whenever he either stopped to sing or knelt to pray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The fathers built an altar, spread a cloth, and, though the sun was burning, lit some candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>They unfurled the banner of a beautiful white squaw, whom they described as the mother of a mighty prince; a prince, who, in a land beyond the sea, had suffered on the cross and thereby saved the souls of men. They sang a psalm which sounded to these children of the forest like a strain of music from the spirit land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <name>Indians</name> held aloof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>These strangers came across the sea, like birds, no <num value="1">one</num> knew whence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Why had they come, unless to steal the squaws, to cut the grass, and take away the elk and antelope?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Yet, when the fathers raised the image of that lovely squaw, and sang that music from the spirit land, the <rs>Red</rs> men crept beneath the fence of sundried bricks, in order to behold that face and hear that psalm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In time their fears were calmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>By offering food to the hungry, clothes to the naked, and potions to the sick, the good fathers won their way into these savage and suspicious hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>They told the natives they had brought to them a message <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> from beyond the clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">Great Spirit</name>, opening a new and nearer path into the land of souls, had given them <placeName key="possibilities=24" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Carlos</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the princes sitting in his presence, as their guide and saint.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Who could repel such teachers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The Franciscan fathers were smooth of speech and grave of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>No lie escaped their lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>No theft was traced to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>They took no squaw by force, and drove no native from his hutch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>In all their actions they appeared to be the <rs>Indian</rs>'s friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>These strangers gave new names to things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>They called the river <placeName reg="Rio Carmelo">Rio Carmelo</placeName>, and the range <rs>Monte Carmelo</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>That lovely squaw was named the <rs>Lady</rs> of Carmelo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>All secrets of the land and sea were known to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>If roots were scarce, these fathers walked into a copse and dug up more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>If fish ran short, they threw nets into the bay and filled their creels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>They knew all qualities of bark and leaf, of herb and grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>They called the stars by name, and understood the winds and tides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>By bit and bit they taught the <rs>Indian</rs> how to till his soil, to net his stream, to snare his wood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Instead of grubs and worms, the <rs>Indian</rs> soon began <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> to feed on hare and snipe, on duck and trout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The fathers taught him how to cook his food; so that in place of gobbling up his roots and reptiles, like a beast, he learnt to dry his seed on stones and bake his water-fowl in stoves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The fathers built a church where they had fixed the cross, and in this church they hung their image of Our <rs type="role" reg="Lady">Lady</rs> of Carmelo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Fields were cleared and sown with corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>Vain delusion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>The blood of your murdered victims cried unceasingly for vengeance, and there could be for your crime no forgetfulness, for you no refuge.
