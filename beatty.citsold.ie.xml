<text><body> 
<p>In the lifetime of all who arrive at mature age, there comes a period when a strong desire is felt to know more of the past, especially to know more of those from whom we claim descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Many find even their chief pleasure in searching among parish records and local histories for some knowledge of ancestors, who for a <num value="100">hundred</num> or <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure> have been sleeping in the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Long pilgrimages are made to the Old World for this purpose, and when the traveler discovers in the crowded church-yard a moss-covered, crumbling stone, which bears the name he seeks, he takes infinite pains to decipher the half-obliterated epitaph, and finds in this often what he regards as ample remuneration for all his trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>How vastly greater would be his satisfaction if he could obtain even the simplest and briefest history of those in whom he takes so deep an interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Who were they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>How were their days spent, and amongst what surroundings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>What were their thoughts, fears, hopes, acts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Who were their associates, and on which side of the great questions of the day did they stand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>A full or even partial answer to these queries would possess for him an incalculable value. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>So, sitting here to-night, in my little library, with wife and children near, and by <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> great kindness <pb id="p.xvi" n="xvi"/> all in life and health, I look forward <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num>, <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure>, and see in each succeeding century, and possibly in each generation, so long as the name shall last, a wonder-eyed boy, curious youth, or inquisitive old man, exploring closets and libraries for things of the old time, stumbling finally on this volume, which has, by the charity of the <rs>State Librarian</rs>, still been preserved; he discovers, with quickening pulse, that it bears his own name, and that it was written for him by <num value="1">one</num> whose body has for centuries been dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Dull and uninteresting as it may be to others, for him it will possess an inexpressible charm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is his own blood speaking to him from the shadowy and almost forgotten past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The message may be poorly written, the matter in the main may be worthless, and the greater events recorded may be dwarfed by more recent and important ones, but the volume is nevertheless of absorbing interest to him, for by it he is enabled to look into the face and heart of <num value="1">one</num> of his own kin, who lived when the <name>Nation</name> was young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In leaving this unpretentious record, therefore, I seek to do simply what I would have had my fathers do for me. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He does not undertake to present a history of the organizations with which he was connected, nor does he attempt to describe the operations of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>His record consists merely of matters which came under his own observation, and of camp gossip, rumors, trifling incidents, idle speculations, and the numberless items, small and great, which, in <num value="1">one</num> way and another, enter into and affect the life of a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In short, he has sought simply to gather up the scraps which fell in his way, leaving to other and more competent hands the weightier matters of the great civil war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Many errors of opinion and of fact he might now correct, and many items which appear unworthy of a paragraph he might now strike out, but he prefers to leave the record as it was written, when cyclopedias could not be consulted, not time taken for thorough investigation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>About <time value="2pm">two o'clock P. M.</time>, for want of something better to do, I climbed the high mountain in front of our camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The side is as steep as the roof of a gothic house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>By taking hold of bushes and limbs of trees, after <num value="0.5">a half</num> hour of very hard work, I managed to get to the top, completely exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The outlook was magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Tygart's valley, the river winding through it, and a boundless succession of mountains and ridges, all lay before me. My attention, however, was soon diverted from the landscape to the huckleberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They were abundant; and now and then I stumbled on patches of delicious raspberries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>I remained on the mountain, resting and picking berries, until <time value="4:30">half-past 4</time>. I must be in camp at <num value="6">six</num> to post my pickets, but there was no occasion for haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>So, after a time, I started leisurely down, not the way I had come up, but, as I supposed, down the eastern slope, a way, apparently, not so steep and difficult as the <num value="1">one</num> by which I had ascended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>I traveled on, through vines and bushes, over fallen timber, and under great trees, from which I could scarcely obtain a glimpse of the sky, until finally I came to a mountain stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>I expected to find the road, not the stream, and began to be a little uncertain as to my whereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>After reflection, I concluded I would be most likely to reach camp by going up the stream, and so started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Trees in many places had fallen across the ravine, and my progress was neither easy nor rapid; but I pushed on as best I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>I never knew so well before what a mountain stream <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> was. I scrambled over rocks and fallen trees, and through thickets of laurel, until I was completely worn out. Lying down on the rocks, which in high water formed part of the bed of the stream, I took a drink, looked at my watch, and found it was <time value="5:30">half-past 5</time>. My pickets were to be posted at <num value="6">six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Having but <num value="0.5">a half</num> hour left, I started on. I could see no opening yet. The stream twisted and turned, keeping no <num value="1">one</num> general direction for <num value="20">twenty</num> rods, and hardly for <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure>. It grew smaller, and as the ravine narrowed the way became more difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/><time value="6oclock">Six o'clock</time> had now come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I could not see the sun, and only occasionally could get glimpses of the sky. I began to realize that I was lost; but concluded finally that I would climb the mountain again, and ascertain, if I could, in what direction the camp lay. I have had some hard tramps, and have done some hard work, but never labored half so hard in a whole week as I did for <num value="1">one</num> hour in getting up that mountain, pushing through vines, climbing over logs, breaking through brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/><num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times I lay down out of breath, utterly exhausted, and thought I would proceed no further until morning; but when I thought of my pickets, and reflected that <persName n="Reynolds,General,,,," id="n0005.0004.00038.00081" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,J.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Reynolds</surname></persName> would not excuse a trip so foolish and untimely, I made new efforts and pushed on. Finally I reached the summit of the mountain, but found it not the <num value="1">one</num> from which I had descended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Still higher mountains were around me. The trees and bushes were so dense I could hardly see a rod before me. It was now <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, an hour after the <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> time when I should have been in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I lay down, determined to remain all night; but my clothing was so thin that I soon became chilly, and so got up and started on again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Once I became entangled in a wilderness of grapevines and briers, and had much difficulty in getting through them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It was now halfpast <num value="7">seven</num>, and growing dark; but, fortunately, at this time, I heard a dog bark, a good way off to the right, and, turning in that direction, I came to a cowpath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Which end of it should I take?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Either end, I concluded, would be better than to remain where I was; so I worked myself into a dog-trot, wound down around the side of the mountain, and reached the road, a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> south of camp, and went to my quarters fast as my legs could carry me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>These mountain streams are unreliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>We had come to regard the <num value="1">one</num> on which we are encamped as a quiet, orderly little river, that would be good enough to notify us when it ,proposed to swell out and overflow the adjacent country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>In fact we had bragged about it, made all sorts of complimentary mention of it, put our tents on its margin, and allowed it to encircle our sick and wounded; but we have now lost all confidence in it. Yesterday, about noon, it began to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>It had been raining, and we thought it natural enough that the waters should increase a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>At <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> it had swelled very considerably, but still kept within its bed of rock and gravel, and we admired it all the more for the energy displayed in hurrying along branches, logs, and sometimes <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> whole trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>At <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> we found it was rising at the rate of <num value="1">one</num> foot per hour, and that the water had now crept to within a few feet of the hospital tent, in which lay <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure> and a dozen or more of sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>At <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, however, we found the river still rising rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>It covered nearly the whole island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Logs, brush, green trees, and all manner of drift went sweeping by at tremendous speed, and the water rushed over land which had been dry half an hour before, with apparently as strong a current as that in the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>We knew then that the sick and wounded were in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>How to rescue them was now the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>A raft was suggested; but a raft could not be controlled in such a current, and if it went to pieces or was hurried away, the sick and wounded must drown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>It was now quite dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Not more than <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> square of dry land remained of all our beautiful island; and the river was still rising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>We watched the water with much anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>At <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> it reached the wagon hubs, and covered every foot of the ground; but soon after we were pleased to see that it began to go down a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Those of us who could not get into the wagons had climbed the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>At <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> it commenced to rain again, when we managed to hoist a tent over the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>At <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> the long-roll, the signal for battle, was beaten in camp, and we could just hear, above the roar of the water, the noise made by the men as they hurriedly turned out and fell into line. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>To-day a soldier about half drunk was arrested for leaving camp without permission and brought to my quarters; he had <num value="2">two</num> canteens of whisky on his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>I remonstrated with him mildly, but he grew saucy, insubordinate, and finally insolent and insulting; <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> he said he did not care a damn for what I thought or did, and was ready to go to the guard-house; in fact wanted to go there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Finally, becoming exasperated, I took the canteens from him, poured out the whisky, and directed <persName n="Patterson,Captain,,,," id="n0005.0009.00092.00243" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,Mary,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName> to strap him to a tree until he cooled off somewhat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> failing in his efforts to fasten him securely, I took my saddle girth, backed him up to the tree, buckled him to it, and returned to my quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>This proved to be the last straw which broke the unfortunate camel's back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>It was a high-handed outrage upon the person of a volunteer soldier; the last and worst of the many arbitrary and severe acts of which I had been guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The regiment seemed to arise <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>, and led on by a few reckless men who had long disliked me, advanced with threats and fearful oaths toward my tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>The bitter hatred which the men entertained for me had now culminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>It being Sunday the whole regiment was off duty, and while some, and perhaps many, of the boys had no desire to resort to violent measures, yet all evidently sympathized with the prisoner, and regarded my action as arbitrary and cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The position of the soldier was a humiliating <num value="1">one</num>, but it gave him no bodily pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Possibly I had no authority for punishing him in this way; and had I taken time for reflection it is more than probable I should have found some other and less objectionable mode; confinement in the guard-house, however, would have been no punishment for such a man; on the contrary it would have afforded him that relief from disagreeable duty which he desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>At any <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> rate the act, whether right or wrong, had been done, and I must either stand by it now or abandon all hope of controlling the regiment hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>I watched the mob, unobserved by it, from an opening in my tent door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Saw it gather, consult, advance, and could hear the boisterous and threatening language very plainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Buckling my pistol belt under my coat where it could not be seen, I stepped out just as the leaders advanced to the tree for the purpose of releasing the man. I asked them very quietly what they proposed to do. Then I explained to them how the soldier had violated orders, which I was bound by my oath to enforce; how, when I undertook to remonstrate kindly against such unsoldierly conduct, he had insulted and defied me. Then I continued as calmly as I ever spoke, <quote>I understand you have come here to untie him; let the man who desires to undertake the work begin &mdash; if there be a dozen men here who have it in their minds to do this thing-let them step forward &mdash; I dare them to do it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>They saw before them a quiet, plain man who was ready to die if need be; they could not doubt his honesty of purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>He gave them time to act and answer, they stood irresolute and silent; with a wave of the hand he bade them go to their quarters, and they went. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>I replied that I needed no assistance; that the officers, with but few exceptions, were my friends, and that I believed there were enough good, sensible soldiers in the regiment to see me through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>He talked very kindly to me; but I feel greatly discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> has practically abandoned the regiment in this period of bad weather, when rigorous discipline is to be enforced, and the boys seem to feel that I am taking advantage of his absence to display my authority, and require from them the performance of hard and unnecessary tasks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Many non-commissioned officers have been reduced to the ranks by court-martial for being absent without leave, and many privates have been punished in various ways for the same reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>It was my duty to approve or disapprove the finding of the court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Disapproval in the majority of cases would have been subversive of all discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Approval has brought down upon me not only the hatred and curses of the soldiers tried and punished, but in some instances the ill &mdash; will also of their fathers, who for years were my neighbors and friends. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>I told him I had received no orders, and knew of no reason why he should report to me, and that in all probability <persName n="Beatty,General,Samuel,,," id="n0005.0024.00255.00826" reg="default:Beatty,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Beatty</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Cleve,,,,,Van" id="n0005.0024.00255.00827" reg="mostcommon:Cleve,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Cleve</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName>, was the person to whom he should report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>I regarded <pb id="p.256" n="256"/> the matter as simply <num value="1">one</num> of the many blunders which were occurring because there were <num value="2">two</num> men of the same name and rank commanding brigades in this army; and so, soon after the officer left, I went to bed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>While rising to strike a light the person entered, and said that he had been ordered to report to me. Supposing it to be the officer of the battery persisting in his mistake, I replied as before, and then turned over and went to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>I thought no more of the matter until <time value="11:30am">11:30 A.

Giving the necessary directions to the <rs type="role" reg="regimental-Commander">regimental commanders</rs>, and sending notice to <persName n="Harker,,,,," id="n0005.0024.00256.00829" reg="mostcommon:Harker,nomatch:0"><surname>Harker</surname></persName> and the battery, I proceeded with all dispatch direct to Department Headquarters, whence the order had issued, to explain the delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>When I entered <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0005.0024.00256.00830" reg="nearbymention:Rosecrans,W.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> shook hands with me cordially, and seemed pleased to see me; but I had no sooner announced my business, and informed him that the order had been delivered to me not <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> before, than he flew into a violent passion, and asked if a battery and regiment had not reported to me the night <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>I replied yes, and was proceeding to give my reasons for supposing that the officers reporting them were in error, when he shouted: <quote>Why, in hell and damnation, did you not mount your horse and come to Headquarters to inquire what it meant?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>I undertook again to tell him I had received no order, and as my brigade had been detailed to work on fortifications I was expecting none; that I had taken it for granted that it was another of the many mistakes occurring constantly because there were <num value="2">two</num> officers of the same name and rank in the army, and had so told the parties reporting; but he would not listen to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>For an instant I was tempted to strike him; but my better sense checked me. I turned on my heel and left the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>Death would have had few terrors for me just then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Here my orders directed me to halt and watch the movements of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>It was a pleasant change from the dull routine of camp duty, and my men were in exuberant spirits, excessively merry and gay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>I shook him by the hand, but could not for the life of me recollect that I had ever seen him before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>I was heartily glad to meet the young man. He looks very different from the smooth-faced boy of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>At Scrougeville-how softly the name ripples on the ear!-we were entertained magnificently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>Above us was the azure canopy; around us a dense forest of cedars, and in a shady nook, a sylvan retreat as it were, a barrel of choice beer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>The mocking-birds caroled from the evergreen boughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>The plaintive melody of the dove came to us from over the hills, and pies at <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> each poured in upon us in profusion; and such pies!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>When night threw over us her shadowy mantle, and the crescent moon blessed us with her mellow light, the notes of the whip-poor-will mingling with the bark of watch-dogs and the barbaric melody of the <name>Ethiopian</name>, floated out on the genial air, and, as stretched on the green sward, we smoked our pipes and drank our beer, thoughts of fairy land possessed us, and we looked wonderingly around and inquired, is Scrougeville a reality or a vision?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>I fear we shall never see the like of Scrougeville again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="--26"><day reg="26">26th instant</day></dateStruct> I received a telegram ordering our immediate return, and we reached <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName> at <time value="2pm">two o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>I had not forgotten the terrible scolding received from the <rs>General</rs> just before starting on this expedition; in fact, I am not likely ever to forget it. It had now been a millstone on my heart for a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>I could not stand it. What could I do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I thought I would send in my resignation, but that I concluded would afford me no relief; on the contrary, it would look as if I had been driven out of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>My next impulse was to ask to be relieved from duty in this department, and assigned elsewhere; but on <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought this did not seem desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>It would appear as if I was running away from the displeasure of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs>, and would affect me unfavorably wherever I might go. I felt that if I was to blame at all in this matter, it was in a very slight degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>The General's language was utterly inexcusable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>He was a man simply, and I concluded finally that I would not leave either the army or the department under a cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>I, therefore, sat down and wrote the following letter:

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Sir-Your attack upon me, on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st instant</day></dateStruct>, has been the subject of thought since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>I have been absent on duty <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>, and, therefore, have not referred to it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>It is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since I entered the army, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, as it is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in my life, that it has been my misfortune to listen to abuse so violent and unreasonable <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> as that with which you were pleased to favor me in the presence of the aids, orderlies, officers, and visitors, at your quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>While I am unwilling to rest quietly under the disgrace and ridicule which attaches to the subject of such a tirade, I do not question your right to censure when there has been remissness in the discharge of duties; and to such reasonable admonition I am ever ready to yield respectful and earnest attention; but I know of no rule, principle, or precedent, which confers upon the <rs>General</rs> commanding this Department the right to address language to an officer which, if used by a private soldier to his company officer, or by a company officer to a private soldier, would be deemed disgraceful and lead to the punishment of the <num value="1">one</num> or the dismissal of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>Insisting, therefore, upon that right, which I conceive belongs to the private in the ranks, as well at to every subordinate officer in the army who has been aggrieved, I demand from you an apology for the insulting language addressed to me on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st instant</day></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>Would it be regarded as an act of presumption and treated with ridicule and contempt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>I feared it might, and sat thinking anxiously over the matter until my orderly returned, with the envelope marked <quote>W. S. R.,</quote> the army mode of acknowledging <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> receipt of letter or order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>The inclosure referred to was, of course, my letter to him. The answer was not, by any means, an apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>On the contrary, it assumed that he was justifiable in censuring me as he did, and yet it expressed good feeling for me. It was probably written in haste, and without thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>It was not satisfactory; but I was led by it to hope that I could reach a point which would be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>I obeyed the order to report promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>He took me into his private office, where we talked over the <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> whole affair together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>I expressed my thanks, shook hands with him, and left, feeling a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more attached to him, and more respect for him than I had ever felt before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>He had the power to crush me, for at this time he is almost omnipotent in this department, and by a simple word he might have driven me from the army, disgraced in the estimation of both soldiers and citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>His magnanimity and kindness, however, lifted a great load from my spirits, and made me feel like a new man; and I am very sure that he felt better and happier also, for no man does a generous act to <num value="1">one</num> below him in rank or station, without being recompensed therefor by a feeling of the liveliest satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>I may have been too sensitive, and may not, probably did not, realize fully the necessity for prompt action, and the weight of responsibility which rested upon the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>There are times when there is no time for explanation; great exigencies, in the presence of which lives, fortunes, friendships, and all matters of lesser importance must give way; moments when men's thoughts are so concentrated on a single object, and their whole <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> being so wrought up, that they can see nothing, know nothing, but the calamity they desire to avert, or the victory they desire to achieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>The error was attributable in part possibly to me, in part to a series of blunders, which had resulted from the fact that there were <num value="2">two</num> persons in the army of the same name and rank, but mainly to those who failed to transmit the order in proper time.</p></div2>
