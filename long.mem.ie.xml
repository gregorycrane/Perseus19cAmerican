<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Immediately after the surrender of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> engaged in the war between the <name>States</name>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0027.0001.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> undertook to write of the campaigns of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> while under his command, and asked such assistance as I could give in supplying reports, despatches, and letters of his, the originals of which had been lost or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Under the impression that they could not be put to better use, such as were then in hand were packed and sent him. He gave up the work, and after a few years his death made it impossible that the world should ever receive the complete story of the <rs>Confederate</rs> campaigns in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 11" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> from the noble mind that projected and controlled them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Possibly, had I not expected our commander to write the history of those campaigns, I should have written it myself a decade or so earlier than I have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>But, personally, I am not sorry that I write of the war <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> after its close, instead of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>While I am so constituted, temperamentally, that I could view then almost exactly as I do now the great struggle in which I bore a part, I do not know that others, in any considerable number, might have so regarded it at the earlier periods to which I refer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I believe that now, more fully than then, the public is ready to receive, in the spirit in which it is written, the story which I present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It is not my purpose to philosophize upon the war, but I cannot refrain from expressing my profound <pb id="p.xvi" n="xvi"/> thankfulness that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has spared me to such time as I can see the asperities of the great conflict softened, its passions entering upon the sleep of oblivion, only its nobler-if less immediate-results springing into virile and vast life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>I believe there is to-day, <hi rend="italics">because of the war</hi>, a broader and deeper patriotism in all <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0027.0001.00000.00003" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>; that patriotism throbs the heart and pulses the being as ardently of the <orgName n="South Carolinian" type="newspaper">South Carolinian</orgName> as of the <rs>Massachusetts Puritan</rs>; that the <rs>Liberty Bell</rs>, even now, as I write, on its Southern pilgrimage, will be as reverently received and as devotedly loved in <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> as in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>And to stimulate and evolve this noble sentiment all the more, what we need is the resumption of fraternity, the hearty restoration and cordial cultivation of neighborly, brotherly relations, faith in Jehovah, and respect for each other; and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant that the happy vision that delighted the soul of the sweet singer of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> may rest like a benediction upon the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, upon the <rs>Blue</rs> and the <name>Gray</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The spirit in which this work has been conceived, and in which I have conscientiously labored to carry it out, is <num value="1">one</num> of sincerity and fairness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>As an actor in, and an eyewitness of, the events of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">65</year></dateStruct>, I have endeavored to perform my humble share of duty in passing the materials of history to those who may give them place in the records of the nation,--not of the <rs>South</rs> nor of the <rs>North</rs>, --but in the history of the <name>United Nation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is with such magnified view of the responsibility of saying the truth that I have written. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I yield to no <num value="1">one</num> as a champion of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier wherever he may have fought and in whatever army, and I do not think I shall be charged more now than in war-time with <quote>underestimating the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Honor to all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>If I speak with some particularity of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, it must be ascribed in part to the affection of a commander, and in <pb id="p.xvii" n="XVii"/> part to my desire to relieve its brave officers and men in the ranks from unjust aspersions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>After <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0027.0001.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:44"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s death, various writers on the <rs>Southern</rs> cause combined with <num value="1">one</num> accord to hold the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> and its commander responsible for all adversity that befell the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I being under the political ban, and the political passions and prejudices of the times running high, they had no difficulty in spreading their misrepresentations <name>South</name> and <name>North</name> until some people, through their mere reiteration, came to accept them as facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I simply present the facts concerning the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> in all fullness and fairness, attested by indisputable authorities, that the public may judge between it and its detractors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In the accounts of battles and movements, the official War Records supply in a measure the place of lost papers, and afford a great mass of most trustworthy statistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I make no doubt but you have often heard of my steamboat, and as often heard it laughed at, but in this I have only shared the fate of other projectors, for it has uniformly been the custom of every country to ridicule the greatest inventions until they had proved their utility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In not reducing my scheme to active use it has been unfortunate for me, I confess, and perhaps the people in general; but, until very lately, I did not think that artists or material could be had in the place sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>However, necessity, that grand mother of invention, has furnished me with an idea of perfecting my plan almost entirely of wooden material, and by such workmen as may be had here; and, from a thorough confidence of its success, I have presumed to ask your assistance <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> and patronage.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>As cadet I had more interest in the school of the soldier, horsemanship, sword exercise, and the outside game of foot-ball than in the academic courses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The studies were successfully passed, however, until the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> year, when I failed in mechanics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>When I came to the problem of the pulleys, it seemed to my mind that a soldier could not find use for such appliances, and the pulleys were passed by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The bridge was safely passed, however, and mechanics left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>At the <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> examination, the end of the academic year, I was called to demonstrate the pulleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The professor thought that I had forgotten my old friend the enemy, but I smiled, for he had become dear to me,--in waking hours and in dreams,--and the cadet passed easily enough for a maximum mark. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The cadets had their small joys and sometimes little troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>When I heard the report around camp that I was to go into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, I set to work at once to try and plan the means for making the move with security and the hope of great results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>As every other move had been proposed to the general and rejected or put off until time had made them inconvenient, I came to the conclusion, as soon as the report reached me, that it was to be the fate of our army to wait until all good opportunities had passed, and then, in desperation, seize upon the least favorable movement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>As no <num value="1">one</num> had proposed this <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> campaign to the general, I thought it possible that we might accomplish something by encouraging his own move, and proposed the following plan,--viz. : to withdraw from our present lines and our forces in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> (the latter to be done in order to give the impression to the enemy that we were retiring from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and concentrating near him for battle or for some other movement) and place our army in a strong concentrated position behind <placeName reg="Chickamauga River">Chickamauga River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>The moment the army was together, to make a detachment of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> to move rapidly against <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0027.0034.00484.08140" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,Ambrose,E.,,:3"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> and destroy him; and by continued rapid movements to threaten the enemy's rear and his communications to the extent that might be necessary to draw him out from his present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>This, at best, is but a tedious process, but I thought it gave promise of some results, and was, therefore, better than being here destroying ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>The move, as I proposed it, would have left this army in a strong position and safe, and would have made sure the capture of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0027.0034.00484.08141" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,Ambrose,E.,,:3"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>,--that is, the army could spare <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>, if it were in the position that I proposed, better than it can spare <num value="12">twelve</num>, occupying the lines that it now does.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/><num value="20000">Twenty thousand</num> men, well handled, could surely have captured <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0027.0034.00484.08142" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,Ambrose,E.,,:3"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> and his forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5875"/>I remember, too, that the march was so hurried that at <num value="1">one</num> point, the head of the leading division (I forget which it was, however) having lost a little distance by taking the wrong road, the rear division was not allowed to halt, but pushed right on, so that it got abreast of the leading division, and the <num value="2">two</num> came down the road side by side, filling the whole road and crowding the retreating men of the divisions which were being driven back into the woods on each side. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6640"/>From the report of scouts received yesterday, it seems that the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 10">Tenth Corps</orgName> is still on this side, or if it went over to the south side, has returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6641"/>The information, too, seems to indicate the arrival of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">Sixth Corps</orgName> from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6642"/>Under these circumstances it will be necessary for me to force the enemy to develop the extent of his move on this side before taking any more of my troops to the south side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6643"/>This I shall do, of course, as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6644"/>I am going to have the roads leading from <placeName reg="White Oak Swamp, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2766789">White Oak Swamp</placeName> to the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road well broken up with subsoil ploughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6645"/>I think that the enemy will then have to build a corduroy there as he moves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6646"/>He surely will, if I can have a good gentle rain after the roads are thoroughly ploughed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6647"/>Can't you apply this idea to advantage on your side on the roads that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00640.09852" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> will be obliged to travel if he goes to <placeName key="tgn,2110885" n="1.000 4" reg="burkeville, nottoway, virginia">Burkeville</placeName> e I don't know, however, but that it would be better for us to go to <placeName key="tgn,2110885" n="1.000 4" reg="burkeville, nottoway, virginia">Burkeville</placeName> and block the roads behind him. If the roads that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00640.09853" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> must travel to get to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> <pb id="p.641" n="641"/> or <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> can be thoroughly ploughed and the trees felled over them, I think that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00641.09854" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will not be able to get to his destination in <measure n="50days" type="date">fifty days</measure>, as the <rs>Northern</rs> papers expect; and it is not thought to be possible that he can collect more than <measure n="50days" type="date">fifty days</measure> rations before reaching the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6648"/>If the parties are properly organized, I think that they might destroy or injure all of the roads so as to break down <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00641.09855" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s animals, and result in the capture of most of his forces.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6652"/>Recent developments of the enemy's designs seem to indicate an early concentration of his armies against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6653"/>This, of course, would involve a like concentration on our part, or the abandonment of our capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6654"/>The latter emergency would, I think, be almost fatal,--probably quite so, after our recent reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6655"/>To concentrate here in time to meet the movements of the enemy we will be obliged to use the little of our <orgName n="Southern Railroad" type="railroad">Southern railroad</orgName> that is left us in transporting our troops, so that we cannot haul provisions over that route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6656"/>I fear, therefore, that we will not be able to feed our troops unless we adopt extraordinary efforts and measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6657"/>I think that there is enough of the necessaries of life left in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 11" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> to help us through our troubles if we can only reach them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6658"/>Impressing officers, however, nor collectors of taxes in kind, nor any other plan heretofore employed, is likely to get those supplies in time or in quantities to meet our necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6659"/>The citizens will not give their supplies up and permit their families and servants to suffer for the necessaries of life without some strong inducement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6660"/>For each <num value="1">one</num> may naturally think that the little that he would supply by denying himself and family would go but little way where so much is needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6661"/>He does not want Confederate money, for his meat and bread will buy him clothes, etc., for his family more readily and in larger quantities than the money that the government would pay. The only thing that will insure our rations and <pb id="p.642" n="642"/> national existence is <hi rend="italics">gold</hi>. Send out the gold through <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 11" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and pay liberal prices, and my conviction is that we shall have no more distress for want of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6662"/>The winter is about over, and the families can and will subsist on molasses, bread, and vegetables for the balance of the year if they can get gold for their supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6663"/>There is a great deal of meat and bread inside the enemy's lines that our people would bring us for gold; but they won't go to that trouble for Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6664"/>They can keep gold so much safer than they can meat and bread, and it is always food and clothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6665"/>If the government has not the gold, it must impress it, or if there is no law for the impressment, the gold must be taken without the law. Necessity does not know or wait for law. If we stop to make laws in order that we may reach the gold it will disappear the day that the law is mentioned in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6666"/>To secure it no <num value="1">one</num> should suspect that we are after it until we knock at the doors of the vaults that contain it, and we must then have guards to be sure that it is not made away with. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6667"/>It seems to my mind that our prospects will be brighter than they have been if we can only get food for our men; and I think that the plan that I have proposed will secure the food. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6668"/>There seem to be many reasons for the opinion that the enemy deems our capital essential to him. To get the capital he will concentrate here everything that he has, and we will be better able to fight him when we shall have concentrated than when we are in detachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6669"/>The <orgName n="Army of Mississippi" type="army">Army of the Mississippi</orgName> will get new life and spirits as soon as it finds itself alongside of this, and we will feel more comfortable ourselves to know that all are under <num value="1">one</num> eye and <num value="1">one</num> head that is able to handle them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6672"/>Your letter of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th instant</day></dateStruct> is received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6673"/>It arrived during my absence in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and has not been overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6674"/>I agree with you entirely in believing that if we had <pb id="p.643" n="643"/> gold we could get sufficient supplies for our army, but the great difficulty is to obtain the gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6675"/>It is not in the coffers of the government or the banks, but is principally hoarded by individuals throughout the country, and is inaccessible to us. I hope, under the reorganization of the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">commissary department</orgName>, if we can maintain possession of our communications, that the army will be better supplied than heretofore, and that we can accumulate some provisions ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6676"/>As regards the concentration of our troops near the capital, the effect would be to produce a like concentration of the enemy, and an increase of our difficulties in obtaining food and forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6677"/>But this, whether for good or evil, is now being accomplished by the enemy, who seems to be forcing <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00643.09864" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00643.09865" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Edward,S.,,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> .in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6678"/>If <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00643.09866" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> marches his army to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00643.09867" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> reports it is his intention to do, and <persName n="Schofield,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00643.09868" reg="mostcommon:Schofield,J.,M.,,:5"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Schofield</surname></persName> is able to unite with him, we shall have to abandon our position on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, as lamentable as it is on every account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6679"/>The want of supplies alone would force us to withdraw when the enemy reaches the <rs>Roanoke</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6680"/>Our line is so long, extending nearly from the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> to the <rs>Nottoway</rs>, and the enemy is so close upon us, that if we are obliged to withdraw we cannot concentrate all our troops nearer than some point on the line of railroad between <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6681"/>Should a necessity, therefore, arise, I propose to concentrate at or near <placeName key="tgn,2110885" n="1.000 4" reg="burkeville, nottoway, virginia">Burkeville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6682"/>The route for the troops north of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> would have to be through <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, on the road to <placeName key="tgn,2110319" n="1.000 10" reg="Amelia Court House, Amelia, Virginia">Amelia Court-House</placeName>, the cavalry passing up the north branch of the river, and crossing at some point above <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6686"/>I wish you to consider this subject, and give me your views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6687"/>I desire you also to make every preparation to take the field at a moment's notice, and to accumulate all the supplies you can. <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00643.09870" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> seems to be preparing to move out by his left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6688"/>He is accumulating near <placeName reg="Hatchers Run, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2380059">Hatcher's Run</placeName> depots of supplies, and apparently concentrating a strong force in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6689"/>Yesterday and to-day trains have passed from his right to his left loaded with troops, which may be the body of <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> which you report having left <placeName key="possibilities=31" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Signal Hill</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6690"/>I cannot tell whether it is his intention to maintain his <pb id="p.644" n="644"/> position until his other columns approach nearer, or to anticipate any movement by us which he might suppose would then become necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6691"/>I wish you would watch closely his movements on the north side of the river, and try and ascertain whether he is diminishing his force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6692"/>If he makes the move which appearances now indicate, he may draw out his whole force, abandoning his lines of defence, or hold them partially and move with the remainder of his troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6693"/>I should like very much to confer with you on these subjects, but I fear it will be impossible for me to go north of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, and I do not know that it will be convenient for you to come here.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6699"/>Your letter of yesterday is received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6700"/>I think you did not understand my letter of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6701"/>My effort was to express conviction that <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00644.09877" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s move was aimed at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00644.09878" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s concentration here would force us to do the same thing; and, that we might be able to do so, it was necessary that we should have gold, by impressment, to purchase our produce supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6702"/>I think that it is not too late yet. We can surely get the gold by sending impressing officers with guards to the vaults in which it is stored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6703"/>I understand that there are <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> men in <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> already organized, and that we may get <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by taking everybody who is able to bear arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6704"/>The staff-officers about <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would be nearly enough to officer this force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6705"/>If such a force can be raised and put in my lines, it can hold them, I think, and my corps can move down to the relief of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00644.09879" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, or it may be moved over to our right, and <pb id="p.645" n="645"/> hold <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00645.09880" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in check, so that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00645.09881" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will be obliged to unite with him or seek a base at <placeName key="tgn,2004674" n="1.000 10" reg="Newbern, Hale, Alabama">New-Berne</placeName> or at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6706"/>This would give <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00645.09882" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:2"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00645.09883" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Edward,S.,,:1"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> time to unite their forces to meet <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00645.09884" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Schofield,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00645.09885" reg="mostcommon:Schofield,J.,M.,,:5"><surname>Schofield</surname></persName> here or wherever they may appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6707"/>We shall lose more men by a move than by a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6736"/>This arrangement will give you force enough to meet any move that the enemy may make upon your right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>If you would give us gold I have reason to believe that we could get an abundant supply for <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, and by that time we ought to be able to reopen our communication with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/>The gold is here, and we should take it. We have been impressing food and all of the necessaries of life from women and children, and have been the means of driving <num value="1000">thousands</num> from their homes in destitute conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>Should we hesitate, then, about putting a few who have made immense fortunes at our expense to a little inconvenience by impressing their gold It is necessary for us, and I do not think that we should let our capital fall into the enemy's hands for fear of injuring the feelings or interests of a few individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>We have expended too much of blood and treasure in holding it for the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> to allow it to go now by default.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6780"/>I received a letter yesterday from a friend in the interior of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> assuring me that there are large quantities of provisions in the <rs>State</rs>; that many have <num value="2">two</num> and <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> supply on hand, and that gold will bring anything <pb id="p.650" n="650"/> that we need to our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6781"/>The gold is in the country, and most of it is lying idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6782"/>Let us take it at once and save <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and end the war. If we hold <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and keep our cotton, the war cannot last more than a year longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6783"/>If we give up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> we shall never be recognized by foreign powers until the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> sees fit to recognize us. If we hold <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and let the enemy have our cotton, it seems to me that we shall furnish him the means to carry on the war against us. It looks to me as though the enemy had found that our policy of destroying the cotton rather than let it fall into their hands would break them down, and that it has forced them to the policy of sending on here to make a contract to feed and clothe our armies in order that they may get the means of carrying on the war of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6784"/>If we will keep our cotton and use our gold our work will be comparatively easy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6795"/>The impression prevails amongst the <rs>Georgia</rs> troops of this command that persons at home having authority to raise local organizations are writing and sending messages to the men in the ranks here, offering inducements to them to quit our ranks and go home and join the home organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6796"/>The large and increasing number of desertions, particularly amongst the <rs>Georgia</rs> troops, induces me to believe that some such outside influence must be operating upon our men. Nearly all of the parties of deserters seem to go home, and it must be under the influence of some promise, such as being received in the local forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6797"/>I would suggest, therefore, the publication of a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> warning all officers or persons authorized to raise local organizations against receiving such deserters or in any way harboring them, and cautioning all such parties that they shall be punished for such crimes under the <num value="22" type="ordinal">twenty-second</num> and <num value="23" type="ordinal">twenty-third</num> Articles of War. It may be well to publish the articles in the order, and to send the order <rs>South</rs> to be published in all the <rs>Southern</rs> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6798"/>If the order is published, I would suggest that copies be sent to the <rs>Southern</rs> papers by special messenger or by parties going South who will take pains to have it published, otherwise I fear it may miscarry or be delayed by our irregular mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6799"/>Another growing evil seems to trouble us now in the shape of applications to raise negro companies, regiments, brigades, etc. The desire for promotion seems to have taken possession of our army, and it seems that nearly all the officers and men think that they could gain a grade or more if allowed to go home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6800"/>I presume that many may try to go merely because they get furloughs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6801"/>I would suggest, therefore, that some regulation be published upon this subject, and it seems to me that it should require the companies to be mustered in as non-commissioned officers and privates by the enrolling officers, and that all of the officers (general, field, and company) shall be selected from the officers, non-commissioned officers, and privates on duty with the armies of the <pb id="p.652" n="652"/> Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6807"/>I suggested that it should be sent on that service because I was apprehensive that our railroad would be in danger of being broken up behind us, leaving us without supplies sufficient to hold <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> until our communications south could be re-established, or in case <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00652.09961" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> went to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6808"/>But I think that we would choose a lesser risk by sparing it in case <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00652.09964" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> makes either of these moves contemplated than we would by holding him here to await the result of these operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6809"/>The enemy seems now to count upon taking <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by raiding upon our lines of communication, and not by attacking our lines of work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6810"/>I think, therefore, we should endeavor to put a force in the field that can contend against that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6811"/>If <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00652.09965" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> sends off his cavalry, he can hardly intend to make any general move of his main army until its return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6812"/>In every aspect of affairs, so far as I am advised, I think that the greater danger is from keeping too close within our trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6813"/>If we can remain where we are independently of the railroad, and if <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0027.0045.00652.09966" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:15"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> would be safe with such a force as <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00652.09967" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s operating against him, in addition to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0027.0045.00652.09968" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:3"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s, we had better keep the division here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6814"/>You know much more about all those points than I do, and are much better able to decide upon them.
