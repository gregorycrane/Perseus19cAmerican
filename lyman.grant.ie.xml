<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><persName n="Lyman,,Theodore,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00002" reg="default:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Lyman</surname></persName> &mdash; man of science &mdash; soldier &mdash; and man of the world &mdash; touched life at many points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>He could draw easily on his varied experience, from a well-trained and well-stored mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>This, added to good looks, charm, and good humor, a ready wit and great tact, made him a striking and telling personality, whether in the camp, a scientific meeting, or social gathering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Among his many activities, he served, from <dateStruct value="1883--"><year reg="1883">1883</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1885--"><year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct>, as a member of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> at <placeName>Washington</placeName>, being elected on an independent ticket from his <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>As he was the only independent member then in Congress, he held there a position of unusual influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>At that time the <rs>Harvard Club</rs> of <placeName>Washington</placeName> celebrated its birth by having a dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> speakers, a member of the cabinet and a senator, indulged in dry and inappropriate political harangues; and the event threatened to be <hi rend="italics">un diner manque</hi>. The chairman next called on <persName n="Lyman,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00003" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><surname>Lyman</surname></persName>, who regretted that the previous proceedings had been tinged with a levity unworthy of so serious an occasion, proposed to do something solemn, sang a comic song, and saved the day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The <rs>Lyman</rs> family of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> is of old <name>English</name> stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Its founder, <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Lyman,,Richard,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00004" reg="default:Lyman,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Lyman</surname></persName>, came to <placeName>America</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>, on the good <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Lyon</rs>, which among its <num value="60">sixty</num> odd passengers included <persName n="Eliot,,John,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00005" reg="default:Eliot,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>, and the wife of <persName n="Winthrop,Governor,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,Frederick,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName> and her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Lyman,,Theodore,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00007" reg="default:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Lyman</surname></persName>, a direct descendant of <persName><foreName>Richard</foreName></persName> in the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> generation, was the son of the pastor of Old York in the <orgName n="Maine District" type="district">District of Maine</orgName>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> 
<p><placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> was then a part of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.</p></note> <pb n="xviii"/>Toward the end of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century <persName><foreName>Theodore</foreName></persName> left <placeName>York</placeName>, and came to <placeName reg="Massachusetts Bay, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,7007518">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>, where he settled in <placeName>Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>There he became a successful man of business, and laid the foundation of the family fortunes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName><foreName>Theodore</foreName></persName> (<dateStruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>) was born in <placeName>Boston</placeName>, and graduated from <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He was a man of note in the community of his time; had studied abroad and travelled in <placeName reg="Europe" key="tgn,1000003">Eastern Europe</placeName>, an unusual circumstance in his day; and was <rs type="role" reg="Mayor">Mayor</rs> of <placeName>Boston</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In <dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">1820</year></dateStruct> he married <quote>the beautiful and accomplished</quote> <persName n="Henderson,,Mary,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00008" reg="default:Henderson,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Henderson</surname></persName> of New York.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Their only son, <persName n="Lyman,,Theodore,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00009" reg="default:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Lyman</surname></persName>, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of that name, and author of the present letters, was born on <dateStruct value="1833-08-23"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="23">23</day>, <year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, in the well-known family homestead at <placeName reg="Waltham, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014579">Waltham, Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But almost his whole life was passed in <placeName>Brookline</placeName>, where his father afterwards built a house, a pleasant and spacious dwelling, set in ample lawns and spreading elms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Young <persName><foreName>Theodore</foreName></persName> received his early education from private tutors, and spent the years <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>His mother died when he was <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> old, and the year of his return from abroad he lost his father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This left him at <num value="16">sixteen</num> an orphan, heir to an independent fortune and the <name>Brookline</name> estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> later he entered <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> with the <name>Class</name> of &lsquo;<num value="55">55</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was natural that <num value="1">one</num> so charming, high-spirited, and companionable should feel himself warmly drawn toward the social side of college life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In his studies, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, he hovered about the middle of his class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was not till his junior year that his intellectual ambitions were aroused, and in his senior year his true abilities asserted themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>For in that year he received the highest marks in the class, and graduated <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>After leaving college, he turned his attention to <pb n="xix"/>Natural History, and worked under <persName n="Agassiz,,Louis,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00010" reg="default:Agassiz,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Agassiz</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Devoting himself to the study of Ophiurans while maintaining a broad interest in the outside world, <persName n="Lyman,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><surname>Lyman</surname></persName> became the authority of his day on that group.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> he married <persName n="Russell,,Elizabeth,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00012" reg="default:Russell,Elizabeth,,,"><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, daughter of <persName n="Russell,,George,R.,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00013" reg="expanded:Russell,George,Robert,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, an <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East India</placeName> merchant of <placeName>Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Lyman,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><surname>Lyman</surname></persName> took his bride home to his <placeName reg="Brookline house">Brookline house</placeName>, where they lived some <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, before starting to travel in <placeName>Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There a daughter was born, and there they remained until she was old enough to be brought safely home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, the year after he graduated, <persName n="Lyman,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><surname>Lyman</surname></persName> was sent by <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Agassiz,Louis,,,"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> on a scientific pilgrimage to <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In Key West he ran across <persName n="Meade,Captain,George,Gordon,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00017" reg="default:Meade,George,Gordon,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>Gordon</foreName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> of the <rs>Engineers</rs>, who was superintending the construction of lighthouses in that district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In those days a traveller was a <foreign lang="la">rara avis</foreign> in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and a lonely wanderer found but scant accommodation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><persName n="Meade,Captain,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Meade,George,Gordon,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> had a ship at his disposal, and was delighted to have the chance of offering <persName n="Lyman,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Theodore,,,"><surname>Lyman</surname></persName> the hospitalities of his floating home, for a far less agreeable man would have been a godsend in the wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Engineer-Officer">Engineer Officer</rs> was <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> the senior of the <rs>Roving Naturalist</rs>, but they proved congenial companions, and the intimacy so formed was afterwards maintained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>And thus it chanced that, on his return from <persName n="Lyman,,Europe,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00020" reg="default:Lyman,Europe,,,"><foreName>Europe</foreName> <surname>Lyman</surname></persName>, from <dateStruct value="1863-09-"><month reg="09">September</month> <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, until the end of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, was a member of the staff of <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Meade,George,Gordon,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>, commanding the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The present volume is composed of a selection of <persName n="Lyman,Colonel,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Europe,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lyman</surname></persName>'s letters to his wife from the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>His vivid picture of the life and actions of that army has an added interest from the contrast that it offers to the late World War. Still, the contest <pb n="xx"/>was titanic for the times; and during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of the <rs>Civil War</rs> there were mustered under the <orgName n="Union Flag" type="newspaper">Union Flag</orgName> over <num value="2">two</num> and <num value="3">three</num> quarter <num value="1000000">millions</num><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> 
<p>This includes re-enlistments and <num value="90">90</num>-day men.</p></note> of men. This was a far greater proportional drain on the <rs>American</rs> youth of that day than the drafts for our recent armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Nevertheless, in no battle of that war was an army of much over <num value="100000">100,000</num> men engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But <num value="1">one</num> must remember that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had less than <num value="75000">75,000</num> men at <placeName>Waterloo</placeName>, and that the <measure n="18miles" type="distance">eighteen miles</measure> or so of intrenched line before <placeName>Petersburg</placeName> could, in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, justly be considered vast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><measure n="5years" type="date">Five years</measure> later the <rs>Franco-Prussian War</rs> taught us to think of battles on a larger scale; while the opening of the century saw <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Nihon" key="tgn,1000120">Japan</placeName> fighting along battle-lines of <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>, with armies of half a <num value="1000000">million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>To-day the white races of the world lie panting from a struggle in which armies of <num value="1000000">millions</num> have wrestled along battle-lines stretching across the <name>Continent</name> of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Small as they were in the light of our recent experiences, the battles of our fathers might have furnished valuable military instruction for <placeName>Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>As <persName n="Lyman,,,,," id="n0069.0001.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lyman,Europe,,,"><surname>Lyman</surname></persName> says, it was shown that an army could dig itself in in a few hours, and completely intrench itself in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. Had the <rs>French</rs> <orgName n="War Office" type="office">war office</orgName> profited by this lesson, and, instead of building what proved useless fortifications, established an intrenched line along the <name>Belgium</name> frontier, there would be to-day, in all probability, no devastated <placeName>France</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The ground was very wet, and we went slipping and sliding, in the red mud, till we drew near the river, when, behold, the whole country alive with train-waggons, columns of infantry, batteries, and ambulances; the latter with the stretchers fastened outside disagreeably suggestive of casualties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The rear of the cavalry had just crossed, when I got there; and <persName n="Pleasonton,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00014.00106" reg="mostcommon:Pleasonton,Alfred,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pleasonton</surname></persName> was on the opposite bank, where I presently joined him, crossing by the railroad bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>He had with him a good many aides, besides orderlies and escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Just at this point we held the southern, as well as the northern, bank and the pickets were some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> out. <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>The country is rolling, but not quite hilly; there are very large open fields (now filled mostly with weeds) and again, considerable woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>In these last our cavalry were hidden, so that you would have said there were not <num value="300">300</num> of them all together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>This I found, presently, was a great point, to conceal men, behind woods and ridges, as much as possible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We all now rode to our extreme picket line and took a view; and there, sure enough, was <persName n="Reb,Mister,,,," id="n0069.0003.00015.00107" reg="mostcommon:Reb,J.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Reb</surname></persName> with <hi rend="italics">his</hi> picket line, about <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of a mile off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Then followed the supports, in close order, and with and behind them came the field batteries, all trooping along as fast as they could scramble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It was now between <num value="8">eight</num> and <num value="9">nine</num> and the sun was bright, so that the whole spectacle was, to a greenhorn like me, <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Not the least remarkable feature was the coolness of <persName n="Reb,Mister,,,," id="n0069.0003.00015.00111" reg="mostcommon:Reb,J.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Reb</surname></persName> under these trying circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Their videttes stared a few moments, apparently without much curiosity, then turned tail and moved off, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at a walk, then at a trot, and finally disappeared over the ridge at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>We rode on about a mile, keeping a little behind the skirmishers; <persName n="Buford,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00015.00112" reg="mostcommon:Buford,John,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buford</surname></persName> and his Staff being just ahead and to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>To the left we could hear cannon, <persName n="Kilpatrick,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00015.00113" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,Judson,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> having got into a skirmish there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Much pleased with their good shot, they proceeded to give our Staff a taste; and missiles of various kinds (but all disagreeable) began to skip and buzz round us. It was to me extraordinary to see the precision with which they fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>All the shot flew near us, and, while I had gone forward to the crest of the ridge to get a better view, a shell exploded directly in the midst of the <rs>Staff</rs>, wounding an orderly and very neatly shaving a patch of hair off the horse of <persName n="Hutchins,Captain,,,," id="n0069.0003.00016.00115" reg="mostcommon:Hutchins,Benjamin,Tucker,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hutchins</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>By the time we had got a few miles further, the enemy had brought forward all his cavalry and began firing with rifles, to which our men replied with their carbines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We now entered a wooded tract, interspersed with mud-holes and springy ground, and here the enemy made quite a hard stand, for the town of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> lay a couple of miles beyond and they wished to gain time to get off their stores by the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The advanced regiments were therefore dismounted and sent into the woods, while the artillery tried to find some place whence the guns could be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>It was at this place that I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> heard the yells, for which the <rs>Rebels</rs> are noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>They were the other side of a high bank, covered with bushes, and they yelled to keep their spirits up as long as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>But they were soon driven through the woods and then we came on an open country, in full view of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>This was a very interesting sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The hills are, hereabout, quite large, and on the <num value="1">one</num> opposite us stood <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, very prettily situated, <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>the railroad running through the lower part of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Just in the outskirts the <rs>Rebels</rs> had planted <num value="2">two</num> batteries, as a last check, and behind were drawn up their supports of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Our cavalry were coming out of the woods, on all sides, moving on the town in form of a semi-circle, while the guns were pelting those of the enemy with might and main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Suddenly we were aware of a railroad train slowly leaving the depot, and immediately several guns were turned on it; but it went off, despite the shells that burst over it. Then there suddenly appeared a body of our cavalry, quite on the left of the town, who made a rush, at full speed, on <num value="3">three</num> cannon there stationed, and took the whole of them with their caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This was a really handsome charge and was led by <persName n="Custer,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00017.00117" reg="mostcommon:Custer,George,Armstrong,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Custer</surname></persName>, who had his horse shot under him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He wears a huzzar jacket and tight trousers, of faded black velvet trimmed with tarnished gold lace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>His head is decked with a little, gray felt hat; high boots and gilt spurs complete the costume, which is enhanced by the <rs>General</rs>'s coiffure, consisting in short, dry, flaxen ringlets!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>They have spoiled my boots but they didn't gain much there, for I stole 'em from a Reb.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>And certainly, there was <num value="1">one</num> boot torn by a piece of shell and the leg hurt also, so the warlike ringlets got not only <num value="15">fifteen</num>, but <num value="12">twelve</num> [additional] days' leave of absence, and have retreated to their native <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The Rebels now retreated in all haste, and we rode at once in, and found a good many supplies at the depot with <pb id="p.18" n="18"/>a number of rifles and saddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>As we rode up, the building was beset with grinning dragoons, each munching, with great content, a large apple, whereof they found several barrels which had been intended for the comfort of <persName n="Stuart,Mister,,,," id="n0069.0003.00018.00119" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Zeb,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s dashing knights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>I was surprised at the good conduct of the gypsy-looking men. They insulted no <num value="1">one</num>, broke nothing, and only took a few green peaches, which, I fancy, amply revenged themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>A queer thing happened in the taking of the <num value="3">three</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>As we got in sight of it, the prospect was not cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The opposite bank, partly wooded and partly covered with cultivation, rose in steep, high hills, which completely commanded our side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It was a fine sight to see the column splashing along the wood road, lying between fine oak trees; but the fine sight was presently interrupted by a shell, which exploded about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">100 yards</measure> ahead of me and right among the horses' legs, without touching me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>A sense of coldness about the legs roused me to a sense of my position, and I speedily added more warm garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Breakfast was ready by the time it was light; and, every mouthful of beef I stowed away, I expected to hear the cannon that would announce the opening of the great battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>My last formal note, I believe, informed you we were to move <quote>to-morrow</quote> (<num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num>). And, sure enough, yesterday we kept our Thanksgiving by marching, horse, foot, and artillery, as hard as we could paddle towards <placeName reg="Germanna Ford">Germanna Ford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The above rough map, with the other I sent when I wrote at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, will sufficiently explain our moves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>From <pb id="p.52" n="52"/><placeName reg="Rapid Ann Station">Rapid Ann Station</placeName> to <placeName reg="Morton's Ford">Morton's Ford</placeName>, the <rs>Rebels</rs> have a strong line of entrenchments, but, beyond that, it is practicable to force a crossing, because the north bank commands the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Our forces were encamped in a sort of semi-circle, of which <num value="1">one</num> end rested on <placeName reg="Kelly's Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2112479">Kelly's Ford</placeName> on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and the other (at the north) on a tributary of the same river; the centre being about at <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station</placeName>. . . . The artillery officers had placed <num value="2">two</num> masked batteries, ready to open on the south bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>On the other side of the river there were extensive breastworks, which, however, seemed not occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Nevertheless, we could not tell that the woods were not full of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>As the main resistance might be offered here, it was necessary that all the corps should force the passage at the same time, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>It so happened that <persName n="French,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00052.00257" reg="mostcommon:French,William,Henry,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName> was much delayed by heavy roads and other causes, so we had to wait till past <num value="12">twelve</num> before throwing the pontoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>When this was done, there was no opposition whatsoever; but the engineers were stupid enough not to have enough boats, and this made more delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>However, about <time value="2pm">two P. M.</time> the troops and artillery began to cross, <num value="1">one</num> division having already forded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>The solemn and punctual <persName n="Sykes,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00052.00258" reg="mostcommon:Sykes,George,,,:2"><surname>Sykes</surname></persName> crossed below, at <num value="12">twelve</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>But the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> and <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, being very large, did not all get over till night, and their artillery, by reason of bad roads, had to come over by <placeName reg="Germanna Bridge">Germanna Bridge</placeName>, and was not over till <num value="5">five</num> the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>We (Headquarters) camped on the north bank of the river, near the <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>It was a magnificent night, but cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The trains came in after dark, and we had quite a time in finding tents and bedding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Everything is comparative: when I got my tent pitched, my roll of bedding in position, and a little end of a candle lighted, I felt as comfortable as if I came home to a nicely furnished house, <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>with a good fire burning and the tea-table just set!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>I was up this morning a good deal before daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The moon shone very bright and the hoar frost glittered on the tents. . . . At an early hour the <rs>Staff</rs> crossed, passing on the steep bank crowds of ambulances and waggons, which of course made the <rs>General</rs> very mad. . . . Do you know the scrub oak woods above <placeName reg="Hammond Pond, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2374203">Hammond's Pond</placeName>, a sort of growth that is hard for even a single man to force his way through for any great distance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>That is the growth of most of this country, minus the stones, and plus a great many <quote>runs</quote> and clay holes, where, in bad weather, vehicles sink to their axles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Along this region there are only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> roads that can be counted on. These are the turnpike, the plank road south of it, and the plank road that runs from <placeName reg="Germanna Ford">Germanna Ford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>There are many narrow roads, winding and little known, that in good weather may serve for the slow passage of columns (though they are mere farmers' or woodcutters' thoroughfares); but a day's rain will render them impassable for waggons and artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>This whole region (which includes the field of <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, a little to the east) is known as the <quote><placeName key="tgn,7017622" n="1.000 715" reg="wilderness, spotsylvania, virginia">Wilderness</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>Over much of it there is no chance to deploy troops, scarcely skirmishers, and no place for artillery. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Somewhere about <num value="10.30">10.30</num> we got to the turnpike and halted, say a mile before <placeName reg="Robertson's Tavern">Robertson's Tavern</placeName>; where the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">2d Corps</orgName> had arrived and found the enemy in front; about <num value="11">eleven</num> they had heavy skirmishing and drove the enemy back, getting also a few prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>They then formed line of battle and waited news from French on the right, and <persName n="Sykes,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00053.00259" reg="mostcommon:Sykes,George,,,:2"><surname>Sykes</surname></persName> on the left, coming on the plank road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The day was raw and we stood near the road, over some fires we had built, waiting for news of <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00053.00260" reg="mostcommon:French,William,Henry,,:1"><surname>French</surname></persName>, to form a junction and attack at once; for <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00053.00261" reg="mostcommon:Warren,Gouverneur,Kemble,,:2"><surname>Warren</surname></persName> alone formed a weak centre and <pb id="p.54" n="54"/>could not risk an engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Officer after officer was despatched to him, piloted by niggers who said they knew the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>The indefatigable <rs>Ludlow</rs> went in the opposite direction, and reported <persName n="Sykes,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00054.00262" reg="mostcommon:Sykes,George,,,:2"><surname>Sykes</surname></persName> coming along all right. . . . At <num value="12.30">12.30</num> we heard cannon on our extreme right, which seemed to announce <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00054.00263" reg="mostcommon:French,William,Henry,,:1"><surname>French</surname></persName>; still no authentic news, and the precious minutes fled rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>At last, late in the afternoon, came authentic despatches that <persName n="French,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00054.00264" reg="mostcommon:French,William,Henry,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName>'s advance had had a heavy fight with the <rs>Rebels</rs>, in force, and had driven them from the field; but had thus been greatly delayed, and besides had found no roads, or bad roads, and could not effect a junction that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>And so there was <orgName n="Corps"><persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00054.00265" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,John,,,:3"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>'s Corps</orgName> jammed up in the woods behind, and kept back also!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>So we pitched camp and waited for morning.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>I thought that our wedding day would be celebrated by a great battle, but so it was not fated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Let us see, a year ago, we were in <placeName reg="Paris, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2113557">Paris</placeName>; and <hi rend="italics">this</hi> year, behold me no longer ornamenting the <name>Boulevards</name> but booted and spurred, and covered with an india-rubber coat, standing in the mud, midst a soft, driving rain, among the dreary hills of Old Virginny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>It was early in the morning, and we were on the crest, near <placeName reg="Robertson's Tavern">Robertson's Tavern</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>On either side, the infantry, in line of battle, was advancing, and a close chain of skirmishers was just going into the woods; while close in the rear followed the batteries, laboriously moving over the soft ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The enemy had fallen back during the night, and we were following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>When the troops had got well under way, the <rs>General</rs> took shelter in the old tavern, to wait for the development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>He had not to wait long, before a brisk skirmish fire, followed by the <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName>, announced that we had come on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Immediately we <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>mounted and rode rapidly towards the front, slop, slop, slop, through the red mud, and amid ambulances and artillery and columns, all struggling forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>We had come on them sure enough, and on their line of works into the bargain, whereof we had. notice beforehand, by spies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>A halt was therefore ordered and the different corps ordered into position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>This was a tremendous job, in the narrow wood-roads, deep with mud; and occupied fully the whole day. If you consider that the men must often move by fours, then a division of <num value="4000">4000</num> men, closed up, would occupy in marching some <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">1000 yards</measure>, and, by adding the space for pack horses, and the usual gaps and intervals, it would be nearer a mile; so you see how an army would string out, even with no artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>You must remember also that these long columns cannot move over <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> in an hour; often not so much . . . .</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>I rode to and along our front to see the enemy's position, which is a fearfully strong <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Within about a mile of our position, there runs a high, gradually sloping ridge, which trends in a northerly and southerly direction, and crosses the turnpike at right angles, where it is naked, though to the right and left it is wooded in some parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Between this and a parallel high ground, occupied by us, is a shallow ravine, in which was a small stream, <placeName reg="Mine Run, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,2516268">Mine Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Along their ridge the <rs>Rebels</rs> have thrown up a heavy and continuous breastwork, supported by entrenched batteries; and, in some places at least, they probably have a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Any troops, advancing to the assault, would be exposed to a <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> fire from the very outset, over the space of a mile, besides having to encounter the still worse musketry at the end. At daylight this morning, General <pb id="p.56" n="56"/><persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0069.0003.00056.00266" reg="mostcommon:Warren,Gouverneur,Kemble,,:2"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>, with his own corps and a division of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, marched towards our extreme left, where, it was understood, the right of the enemy could be turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>His attack was to be a signal for attacking in other places on the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>However, despite that the rain had ceased, the bad roads delayed a good deal, and a false report of entrenchments delayed more; so that, when he got there, after driving in an outlying force, the day was too far advanced for an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Almost before daylight our waggons were loaded and away, for the <name>Headquarters</name> are only a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in the rear of our heavy guns and directly on the road, so that we expected a nice lot of shells, say at <time value="8:10am">8.10 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>We <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>tried to take it all philosophically, but it was hard, very hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Most of all to <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00057.00276" reg="nearbymention:Meade,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> and <persName n="Humphreys,General,,,," id="n0069.0003.00057.00277" reg="mostcommon:Humphreys,Andrew,Atkinson,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>, who really took it admirably, for both of them have excellent tempers of their own, which, on occasions, burst forth, like <num value="12">twelve</num>-pounder spherical case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>He drew aside, with the <num value="2">two</num> other generals, and there they stood, in long consultation, over a fire which had been made for them, for the air was sharp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>The review was on a large flat (usually very wet, but now quite dry, yet rather rough for the purpose) and consisted of the <rs>Corps</rs> and <rs>Kilpatrick</rs>'s division of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>When they were all ready, we rode down the lines, to my great terror, for I thought the womenkind, of whom there were half a dozen, would break their necks; for there were <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> ditches, and we went at a canter higglety-pigglety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>Such things you read of in books, but they do not happen often, particularly with such armies to oppose as those of the <rs>Rebels</rs> . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>The great feature of this campaign is the extraordinary use made of earthworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>When we arrive on the ground, it takes of course a considerable time to put troops in position for attack, in a wooded country; then skirmishers must be thrown forward and an examination made for the point of attack, and to see if there be any impassable obstacles, such as streams or swamps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>Meantime what does the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>Hastily forming a line of battle, they then collect rails from fences, stones, logs and all other materials, and pile them along the line; bayonets with a few picks <pb id="p.100" n="100"/>and shovels, in the hands of men who work for their lives, soon suffice to cover this frame with earth and sods; and within <num value="1">one</num> hour, there is a shelter against bullets, high enough to cover a man kneeling, and extending often for a mile or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>When our line advances, there is the line of the enemy, nothing showing but the bayonets, and the battle-flags stuck on the top of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>It is a rule that, when the <rs>Rebels</rs> halt, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day gives them a good riflepit; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, a regular infantry parapet with artillery in position; and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> a parapet with an abattis in front and entrenched batteries behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>These Rebels are not half-starved and ready to give up &mdash; a more sinewy, tawny, formidable-looking set of men could not be. In education they are certainly inferior to our native-born people; but they are usually very quick-witted within their own sphere of comprehension; and they know enough to handle weapons with terrible effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>At daylight it would be hard to say what opinion was most held in regard to the enemy, whether they would attack, or stand still; whether they were on our flanks, or trying to get in our rear, or simply in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>However, it was not long before they were reported as fallen back &mdash; a good deal back from the left and right and somewhat from our centre on the pike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>Reconnaissances were at once thrown out; and the <rs>General</rs> sent me to the front, on the pike, to learn how matters stood; where I found, on the most undoubted evidence, that we were throwing solid shot and shell at the rebels, and they were throwing solid shot and shells at us. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>There was heavy skirmishing, with some artillery, all that morning, until we determined that the enemy had swung back both wings; and shortened and straightened his line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>There lay both armies, each behind its breastworks, <pb id="p.102" n="102"/>panting and exhausted, and scowling at each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Indeed, a little while after we were gone they did come down and fired into the telegraph waggon, wounding the side of the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>I can tell you aqua-fortis is mild to the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> commanding when he gets put out; which is quite not at all unfrequently; but I have seen him in no such fits as in the falling back from <pb id="p.129" n="129"/><placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>We made a halt to let the column get up, at a <orgName n="the Poor House" type="org">poor house</orgName> by the way. There were a lot of little children who were crying, and the mother too, for that matter &mdash; a thin ill-dressed common-looking woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>They said they had been stripped of nearly everything by the cavalry and expected to starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>So the soft-hearted General, who thought of his own small children, gave them his lunch, and <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> also; for he is a tender-hearted man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>We drove the <name>Rebs</name> across that field, and then we burned the bridge, and picketed the river,</quote> etc. The bridge destroyed by the valiant <rs>Cadwalader</rs> had never been replaced, and now our engineers had thrown a pontoon, over which the artillery of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">6th Corps</orgName> was rapidly passing, while the flat was full of batteries, and of waggons waiting their turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>These canvas pontoons are funny looking; they consist of a boat-shaped frame, which is wrapped in a great sheet of canvas and put in the water, this making a boat, on which part of the bridge-floor may rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>It looks as if the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> had undertaken the washing business on a large scale, and was <quote>soaking</quote> his soiled clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>But <hi rend="italics">here</hi> they seem almost idiotic, and, what is worse, they will plunder and they won't fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>Really, as soldiers, they are miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>Actually, a Yankee regiment would drive a brigade of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>We had very severe fighting this morning, all along the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>If you look on the map you may follow our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>The line of battle faced westerly, towards <placeName reg="Twymans Mill, Madison, Virginia" key="tgn,2114675">Gaines's Mill</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, with a corps covering the right flank, and the left refused (a wing is <quote>refused</quote> when it is swung back from the direction of the main line). In some sort-this was the <rs n="Battle of Gaines Mill" type="battle">battle of Gaines's Mill</rs> reversed. . . . The Rebel lines were about parallel with ours and they were throwing up dirt as hard as they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>No country could be more favorable for such work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>The soldiers easily throw up the dirt so dry and sandy with their tin plates, their hands, bits of board, or canteens split in <num value="2">two</num>, when shovels are scarce; while a few axes, in experienced hands, soon serve to fell plenty of straight pines, that are all ready to be set up, as the inner face of the breastwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>I can't say I heard with any great hope the order, given last night, for a <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName> at <num value="4.30">4.30</num> the next morning!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>You see <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00143.00856" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Horatio,Gouverneur,,:1"><surname>Wright</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00143.00857" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Baldy,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> took their front line and drove them back <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>. <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> was <num value="24">twenty-four</num>, and <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> would be <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>, for them to bring up and entrench their whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>If we <hi rend="italics">could</hi> smash them up, the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> lay behind them; but I had no more hope of it, after <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>, than I had of takings <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>. <time value="4:30">Half-past 4</time> found us at <persName n="Kelly,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00143.00858" reg="mostcommon:Kelly,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelly</surname></persName>'s, the <name>Headquarters</name> of <persName n="Wright,General,,,," id="n0069.0006.00143.00859" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Horatio,Gouverneur,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>; the brave General himself, however, had gone to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>At that moment the cannon opened, in various directions, and the <rs>Rebels</rs> replied vigorously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>There has been no fight of which I have seen so little as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The woods were so placed that the sound, even, of the musketry was much kept away, and the fighting, though near us, was completely shut from <pb id="p.144" n="144"/>view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>All the warfare for us was an occasional roundshot, or shell, that would come about us from the <rs>Rebel</rs> batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>In the direction of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 18">18th Corps</orgName> the crash of the musketry was very loud, but elsewhere, scarcely to be noticed. . . . About <num value="5">five</num> we had a gleam of hope for our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>News came that <persName n="Barlow,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00144.00860" reg="mostcommon:Barlow,Francis,Channing,,:2"><surname>Barlow</surname></persName> had carried their works and taken <num value="17">seventeen</num> guns; and so he did; but it is <num value="1">one</num> thing to get in, another to stay in. His men advanced heroically and went over the breastworks with a rush; but the enemy had reserves massed behind, well knowing that his extreme right was seriously threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>Before our supports could get up, their forces were down on our men, while a heavy enfilade of canister was kept up from flanking batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/><persName n="Barlow,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00144.00861" reg="mostcommon:Barlow,Francis,Channing,,:2"><surname>Barlow</surname></persName> was driven out with heavy loss, and succeeded in getting off only about <num value="300">300</num> of the prisoners he took.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Like good soldiers, however, his men stopped and turned about, close to the works, and there entrenched themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>At <num value="6">six</num> we got notice that <orgName n="division"><persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00144.00862" reg="mostcommon:Russell,Elizabeth,,,:2"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> could not carry the line in their front.

A singular thing about the whole attack, and <num value="1">one</num> that demonstrated the staunchness of the troops, was, that our men, when the fire was too hot for them to advance and the works too strong, did not retreat as soldiers often do, but lay down where some small ridge offered a little cover, and there staid, at a distance from the enemy varying from <num value="40">forty</num> to perhaps <measure n="250yards" type="distance">250 yards</measure>. When it was found that the lines could not be carried, <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0069.0006.00144.00865" reg="nearbymention:Meade,George,Gordon,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> issued orders to hold the advanced position, all along, and to trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The main fight lasted, I suppose, some <num value="3">three</num> <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>hours, but there was sharp skirmishing and artillery firing the whole day. The Rebels threw canister in large quantities, doing much damage. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>In the afternoon came <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00145.00866" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Horatio,Gouverneur,,:1"><surname>Wright</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00145.00867" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,Scott,,:2"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, with their Staff officers, to consult with <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0069.0006.00145.00868" reg="nearbymention:Meade,George,Gordon,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>They looked as pleasant as if they had been out to dine, instead of standing ail day with shells, bullets and canister coming about them; for we now have a set of corps commanders who, in action, go, as they say, where they <quote>can see</quote> ; which means sitting calmly in places where many people would be so scared they wouldn't know the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> from the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>All was quiet, but these braves had hardly dismounted when the <rs>Rebel</rs> guns again opened and the shells came with fearful precision over the spot!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>The other cit, quite paralyzed, lay down flat behind a ridge; in a few minutes he looked up at a Staff officer and, with the cold sweat rolling off him, exclaimed: <quote>Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>You ought to see them skip!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>It would be odd, if it were rot so dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>I recollect he was lying on his cot at the time, with his riding boots cocked up on the footboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>My ideas on flags of truce were chiefly mediaeval and were associated with a herald wearing a tabard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>However, I received the order as if my employment had been that from early youth, and proceeded at once to array myself in <quote>store</quote> clothes, sash, white gloves and all other possible finery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>After searching in vain for a bugler who could blow a <quote>parley,</quote> I set forth with only a personable and well-dressed cavalry sergeant, and found the gallant <rs>Hancock</rs> reposing on <hi rend="italics">his</hi> cot. <quote>Well, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>,</quote> says H., <quote>now you can't carry it out on my front, it's too hot there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>Your best way is to go to the left, where there are only pickets, and the officers there will get it out.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>So the ever-laborious <persName n="Mitchell,Major,,,," id="n0069.0006.00150.00901" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,William,Galbraith,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> was summoned and told to provide some whiskey for the <name>Rebs</name> and a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>The last was a great point: there seemed nothing white about, except the <rs>General</rs>'s shirt, but at last he found a pillowcase which was ripped up and put on a staff, and you would have admired it when it was completed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>Then we made our way towards the left and found <persName n="Birney,General,,,," id="n0069.0006.00150.00902" reg="mostcommon:Birney,David,Bell,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Birney</surname></persName>'s men moving that way, who furnished us information about the road, and a guide, <persName n="Hapgood,Colonel,,,," id="n0069.0006.00150.00903" reg="mostcommon:Hapgood,Charles,Eager,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hapgood</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NH5">5th New Hampshire</orgName>, corps officer of the day. He was a live <name>Yankee</name>, a thorough <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> man &mdash; tall, sinewy, with a keen black eye, and a driving way about him. He was ornamented with a bullet-hole through his hat, another through the trousers, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> on his sword scabbard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>We rode forward till we struck the breastwork at <placeName><persName n="Miles,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00150.00904" reg="mostcommon:Miles,Nelson,Appleton,,:1"><surname>Miles</surname></persName>'s Headquarters</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>It was a curious sight!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>Something like an Indian family camped half underground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>Here was the <pb id="p.151" n="151"/>breastwork, behind which were dug a number of little cellars, about <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> deep, and, over these, were pitched some small tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>And there you could see the officers sitting, with only their heads above ground, writing or perhaps reading; for it was a quiet time and there were no bullets or shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>We followed the line to its end, near by, and then rode through the pine woods a little way. Here <persName n="Hamyl,Colonel,,,," id="n0069.0006.00151.00905" reg="mostcommon:Hamyl,&mdash;,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hamyl</surname></persName> remarked in a ghostly voice: <quote>Do you know where you are going?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>There have been <num value="2">two</num> field officers killed just here.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>To whom <persName n="Hapgood,Colonel,,,," id="n0069.0006.00151.00906" reg="mostcommon:Hapgood,Charles,Eager,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hapgood</surname></persName> (with injured pride): <quote>Yes <hi rend="italics">sir</hi>! I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> know where I am going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>There's some bullets comes through here; but <hi rend="italics">none to hurt</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>Without definitely settling what precise minimum of balls was <quote>none to hurt,</quote> we continued on. Presently the cautious <rs>Hapgood</rs> pulled up and peered round; and I could see an open field through the trees and another taller wood behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/><quote>Now,</quote> said the <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> patriot, <quote>those tallest trees are full of their sharpshooters; if we strike into the field <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> above here, they will fire; but, just below, they can't see.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>So we followed on, and, as soon as we were in the open ground, started at a gallop and got into another wood, close to where I have put my flag on the map. There was here a road, leading past a mill-pond, which however was some quarter of a mile away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Our pickets held this road for some <num value="100">hundred</num> or <measure n="2yards" type="distance">two yards</measure> from us, and then came the enemy's pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> said he knew a good place to approach, and went forward to call to some of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>After a great deal of delay, the lieutenant on our side got <num value="1">one</num> of them to send for an officer, and then word was sent down each line to cease firing in that command, as a flag of truce was going in. Then we left our horses and went forward, the sergeant carrying the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>As we turned a corner, close by, we <pb id="p.152" n="152"/>came almost upon their party, standing some paces off. It looked exactly like a scene in an opera; there was never anything that so resembled something got up for stage effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>The sun was near setting, and, in the heavy oak woods, the light already began to fade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>On the road stood a couple of Rebel officers, each in his grey overcoat, and, just behind, were grouped some <num value="20">twenty</num> soldiers &mdash; the most gipsy-looking fellows imaginable; in their blue-grey jackets and slouched hats; each with his rusty musket and well-filled cartridge-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>I walked up in all stateliness (fully aware, however, that white cotton gloves injured the ensemble), and was introduced to <persName n="Wooten,Major,,,," id="n0069.0006.00152.00907" reg="mostcommon:Wooten,Thomas,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wooten</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="14NCShrp">14th North Carolina sharpshooters</orgName>, belonging to <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n0069.0006.00152.00908" reg="expanded:Hill,Ambrose,Powell,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="Corps">Corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>He was a well-looking man, with quiet and pleasing manners; and, to see us all together, you would suppose we had met to go out shooting, or something of that kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>I am free to confess that the bearing of the few Rebel officers I have met is superior to the average of our own. They have a slight reserve and an absence of all flippancy, on the whole an earnestness of manner, which is very becoming to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>They get this I think partly from the great hardships they suffer, or, still more, the hardships of those at home, and from a sense of their ruin if their cause fails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>We attack, and our people live in plenty, with no <num value="1">one</num> to make them afraid; it makes a great difference. . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>So it was sent in, an answer promised in a couple of hours, and we all sat down on the grass to wait &mdash; or rather on the leaves, for this sandy soil produces no grass to speak of. As I had time to look about and, still more to sniff about, I became aware that the spot was not <pb id="p.153" n="153"/>so charming as it looked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>There had been a heavy cavalry skirmish in the woods and they were full of dead horses, which, as the evening closed, became, as <persName n="Agassiz,,,,," id="n0069.0006.00153.00910" reg="mostcommon:Agassiz,Louis,,,:3"><surname>Agassiz</surname></persName> would say, <quote>highly offensive.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>It was positively frightful!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>and there I waited till <dateStruct value="11"><year reg="11">eleven</year></dateStruct> at night!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>Not even the novelty of the position was enough to distract <num value="1">one</num>'s attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>As to the pickets, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were determined to have also a truce, for, when a Reb officer went down the line to give some order, he returned quite aghast, and said the <num value="2">two</num> lines were <hi rend="italics">together</hi>, amiably conversing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>He ordered both to their posts, but I doubt if they staid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>At <time value="8:30">half-past 8</time> we had quite a disagreeable experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>There suddenly was heard a shot or <num value="2">two</num> towards our left centre, then quite a volley, and then, <hi rend="italics">whir-r-r-r</hi>, the musketry came running down right towards us, as <num value="1">one</num> regiment after another took it up!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>The next thing I expected was that both sides just near us would take a panic and begin blazing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>The officers sprung to their feet and ran down the lines, to again caution the men; so nobody fired; and there we sat and listened to the volleys and the cannonading, that opened very heavily. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>As it got to be after <num value="10">ten</num>, <persName n="Wooten,Major,,,," id="n0069.0006.00153.00911" reg="mostcommon:Wooten,Thomas,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Wooten</surname></persName> said he would go back and see what was the delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>There came back a lieutenant, soon, that is about <num value="11">eleven</num>, with a note from a superior officer, saying that <quote><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0069.0006.00153.00912" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,Simpson,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s aide-de-camp need not be delayed further,</quote> but that an answer would be sent in at the same point, which could be received by the picket officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>So we shook hands with the <name>Rebs</name> and retreated from the unsavory position. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>I fancy there were not many, for our men make extraordinary exertions in the night to get in their comrades, and those who were not thus reached usually had their sufferings shortened by some stray ball, among the showers that continually passed between the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>Some movement of our troops attracted the enemy, who immediately sent <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> round shot to enfilade the road, and which of course came about our ears in a, most uncomfortable way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>Close to us, on each side, were our batteries, firing as fast as they could, and the rebels were sending back shot, shell, and shrapnel as hard as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>Half a mile is no good with minie rifles; and, as soon as we attacked, the balls came tolerably numerous, cutting up little puffs of sand on the dry field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>We floundered through a little swampy run, brushed through some brush, and came on a little clearing, at the other side of which was a gentleman, with a cocked musket, eyeing us suspiciously, but who withdrew on seeing our color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>There we came on what is always a pretty sight, a picket line in a wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>The men are dotted along, <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> apart, with stronger parties on the roads; and you see them indistinctly, as they stand, half-hidden among trees and bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>As for myself, I looked with some confidence for a salutation of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> bullets; but made no observation, as being superfluous under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>Presently the flag-bearer, who, you may be sure, kept an extremely bright look-out, said: <quote>There's <num value="1">one</num> of 'em!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/>and immediately waved the emblem of peace in a truly conscientious manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>I looked and saw the main road, and, in an open field beyond, stood a single grey-back, looking dubiously at us, with his rifle ready for <pb id="p.172" n="172"/>any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>I told the bugler to blow a parley, which he did in very good style, while I advanced to call to the solitary sentry; but the effect of the bugle was most marvel-lous &mdash; quite as when <quote>he whistled shrill and he was answered from the hill.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>In an instant, a line of some <num value="75">seventy-five</num> men rose, as if out of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>It was their pickets, who had been concealed in little holes, dug in the slope of the gentle hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/><num value="1">One</num> of them laid down his musket and came forward, when I asked for an officer; whereat, he touched his hat (probably awestruck by my cotton gloves) and returned to fetch <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>Then came a red-faced captain, who received my despatch, and a bundle of letters from Rebel prisoners, and promised a speedy answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>So the flag was stuck up on a fence and we waited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>In a few minutes the commander of the pickets hastened out to do me honor--<persName n="Crow,Major,,,," id="n0069.0007.00172.01020" reg="mostcommon:Crow,&mdash;,,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Crow</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, a remarkably bright, nice-looking man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>By this time we had the variety of a visitor on horseback, <persName n="Ring,Colonel,,,," id="n0069.0007.00172.01021" reg="mostcommon:Ring,&mdash;,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ring</surname></persName>, a handsome man, who was curious about the negro troops and said, with an honesty unmistakable, that he would not be a bit afraid to fight them, <num value="1">one</num> against <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>They, however, said nothing at all unpleasant or rude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>The next comer was apparently a Staff officer, a young man of rather a sour countenance, with a large pair of spurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>He brought a message that we should immediately retire from the lines, and hostilities would then recommence, till the answer <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>was ready, when they would put a white flag on their rifle-pit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>This amused me, for I had already seen all that could be seen and knew just where their position was just at that point!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>I returned whence I came, and waited at a wretched, deserted house. . . . At <time value="7pm">seven in the evening</time> I got the reply and carried it in. The sum of it was: <quote>Have the honor to acknowledge your favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2451"/>My spirits to-night are not very high; our project of attack, which in the beginning promised well, has not been a success in the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2458"/>The final springing of the mine was delayed, in order to build heavy batteries and get the guns and mortars in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>I will continue now my letter that broke off last night, and confide to you in all honesty, that I went fast to sleep on the bed and never woke till it was too late for more writing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2465"/>The fact is, it was a day of extraordinary heat, and remarkably close also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2466"/>I had been up at <time value="2:30">half-past 2</time> that morning, and I felt a great deal depressed by the day's work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>Well, I had got my fuse to the mouth of the gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>You must know that all the time they were putting in the powder they could hear the enemy digging pretty near them, over their heads; for they had suspected we were mining, and had begun digging, to try to find it: they sunk a <quote>shaft</quote> or well inside their bastion, and then ran a <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>gallery outside, from which they dug each way, to cut our gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>But they did not go <hi rend="italics">deep</hi> enough and so missed their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>The enemy had lately sent a large part of their force to head off <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0069.0007.00197.01177" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,Scott,,:2"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName>, across the <rs>James</rs>, a movement that had seriously alarmed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 18">18th Corps</orgName> was then to move up in the night, and take position to support the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 9">9th Corps</orgName> in the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">5th Corps</orgName> was to be held in readiness on its part of the line, and to open with musketry as soon as the mine was sprung, in order to keep down the enemy's fire on the assaulting column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/><placeName reg="New batteries">New batteries</placeName> of heavy mortars and siege guns were put in position and the whole artillery was ordered to open on the enemy's batteries, the moment the mine was blown up. The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 9">9th Corps</orgName> was arranged to make a rush to the gap, the moment the explosion took place, and then <num value="1">one</num> column was to keep on, and occupy the crest beyond (the key of the whole position), and others were to look out for an attack on either flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>The hour for springing the mine was <time value="3:30am">3.30 A. M.</time></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>We were all up and horses saddled by <num value="2.30">2.30</num>. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>It was near <time value="3:30">half-past 3</time> when we got there, and only a faint suspicion of daylight was yet to be noticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>It was an anxious time--<measure n="8000l." type="pounds"><num value="8000">eight thousand</num> pounds</measure> of gunpowder to go into the air at once!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>I had considered all I had read about explosions <pb id="p.198" n="198"/>and had concluded it would make little noise and be very circumscribed in its effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>Others, however, thought it might be a sort of earthquake, overturn trees, etc., which idea was founded on the fact that even a dozen pounds confined would pretty nearly blow a house down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>However, we were something like a mile away and would not be likely to get the <hi rend="italics">worst</hi> of it. <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0069.0007.00198.01181" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Ginral,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> with his Staff had gone to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>Which was a true guess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>Where the fuse was spliced, it stopped burning; upon which <persName n="Pleasants,Colonel,,,," id="n0069.0007.00198.01184" reg="mostcommon:Pleasants,Henry,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Pleasants</surname></persName> coolly went into the gallery and fired the new end!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>At <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> before <num value="5">five</num> there was a distant, dull-sounding explosion, like a heavy gun, far away; and, in an instant, as if by magic, the whole line of batteries burst forth in <num value="1">one</num> roar, and there was nothing but the banging of the guns and the distant hum of the shells!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>My back was turned at the moment, but those that had a good view say that a mass of earth about <measure n="50feet" type="distance">50 feet</measure> wide and <num value="120">120</num> long was thrown some <measure n="130feet" type="distance">130 feet</measure> in the air, looking like the picture of the <name>Iceland</name> geysers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>The explosion made a crater some <measure n="120feet" type="distance">120 feet</measure> long, <measure n="50feet" type="distance">50 feet</measure> wide, and <num value="25">25</num> deep (so it was described to me).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>So astounded was the enemy and so covered was their position by our augmented artillery, that their reply was weak indeed and was soon almost silenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>Then no gap had been made in the parapet, which, next the mine, was at least <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> high &mdash; all in disobedience to orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/>All this time there was more or less cannon and musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>Orders were sent to take the crest: to push on at once!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>The supports, brought up by the flank in bad order, crowded into the crater and the neighboring bomb-proofs and covered ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>There was some fighting, and the <rs>Rebel</rs> breastworks for <num value="200">200</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure> were taken, with a few prisoners; but advance to the crest the men would not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>We speedily got ready and sallied forth to look at the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>We rode into a piece of pine woods, at the corner of which I was during the assault of the <dateStruct value="-06-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>Some of the advanced camps were here, the danger of their position being plainly marked by the banks of earth put up by each tent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>Getting out of the wood, we came on an open tract, a good deal elevated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>Here, on the left, and by the ruins of a house was a heavy battery, known as the <rs type="place">Taylor house</rs> battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>And here too begins the <quote>covered way.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>Before I saw real operations I never could understand the management of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>On the principle of your battle on <quote>the great white plain,</quote> I had an idea that all the guns were put in the front line: else how could they hit anybody?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>But really there are often no cannon at all there, all being placed in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> or <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> line, or in isolated batteries in these relative positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/><num value="1">One</num> of our heavy siege guns would sometimes have to fire as many as <measure n="1700yards" type="distance">1700 yards</measure> to hit the enemy's breastwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>You see that cannon-shot must rise high in the air to go any distance; so they fire over each other's heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>In practice this system is not without its dangers, owing to the imperfections of shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>In spite of the great advances, much remains to be done in the fuses of shells; as it is, not a battle is fought that some of our men are not killed by shells exploding short and hitting our troops instead of the enemy's, beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>Sometimes it is the fuse that is imperfect, sometimes the artillerists lose their heads and make wrong estimates of distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>From these blunders very valuable officers have lost their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Prudent commanders, when there is any doubt, fire only solid shot, which do not explode, and do excellent service in bounding over the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/><pb id="p.203" n="203"/></p> 
<p>We got off our horses at the edge of the wood and took to the covered way (we might better have ridden). A covered way is singularly named, as it is open on top. It is simply a trench, about <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> wide, with the dirt thrown up on the side towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>It should be deep enough to cover a man standing upright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>The great thing is, so to run it that the enemy cannot get a sight of it <hi rend="italics">lengthwise</hi>, as they could then enfilade it. To this end the way is run zig-zag, and advantage is taken of every hollow, or knoll, that may afford shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>I was not impressed with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of our covered way, as it could be shot into in many places, and was so shallow that it covered me no higher than the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>Probably it was dug by a small officer who was spiteful against men of great inches. . . . We scrambled up the opposite steep bank and stood at the high breastwork of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0069.0007.00203.01218" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Ginral,,,"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s advanced salient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>The parapet was crowded with troops, looking silently at the scene of the late struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>We got also on the parapet and at once saw everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>Opposite, and a little above us, distant about <measure n="350feet" type="distance">350 feet</measure>, was the rough edge of the crater, made by the mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>There were piles of gravel and of sand, and shapeless masses of hard clay, all tumbled on top of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>Upon the ridge thus formed, and upon the remains of the breastwork, stood crowds of Rebel soldiers in their slouched hats and ghostly grey uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>Really they looked like malevolent spirits, towering to an unnatural height against the sky. Each party had a line of sentries close to his works, and, in the midst, stood an officer with a white flag, where the burial parties were at work.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>A Rebel <pb id="p.236" n="236"/>artillery-man lay dead on the parapet, killed so instantly, by a shot through the head, that the expression of his face was unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>At <num value="5.30">5.30</num> we were sitting in the <rs type="place">Peeble house</rs>, waiting for the development of the attack, when we heard very heavy musketry beyond the narrow belt of the woods that separated us from the <rs type="place">Pegram farm</rs>; there was was cheering, too, and then more musketry, and naturally we supposed that <persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0069.0008.00236.01414" reg="mostcommon:Parke,John,Grubb,,:2"><surname>Parke</surname></persName> was assaulting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>But presently there came from the woods a considerable number of stragglers, making their way to the rear; then came even a piece of a regiment, with its colors, and this halted inside the captured works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>The musketry now drew plainly nearer, and things began to look ticklish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>I watched anxiously a brigade of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">5th Corps</orgName> that stood massed in the edge of the wood, beyond the redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>Suddenly it filed to the left, at a double-quick, the brigade colors trotting gaily at the head, then formed line and stood still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>In another moment the men leveled their muskets, fired a heavy volley and charged into the wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>The musketry receded again; a battery went forward and added itself to the general crash, which was kept up till darkness had well set in; <pb id="p.237" n="237"/>while we sat and watched and listened, in comparative safety, just beside the captured redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>It was a tedious business getting a spot; for the whole country was either occupied, or was very dirty from old camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>At quarter to <num value="11">eleven</num>, as I was poking about, I heard firing to the left, pretty sharp for a few minutes, and supposed there might be quite a fight; but it died away, shortly, except the cannon, which were not frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>I got to the front about <num value="1">one</num>, and met General <pb id="p.238" n="238"/>Meade at the <rs type="place">Peeble house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>He had been to the <rs type="place">Pegram house</rs> and it was near there he had such a narrow escape from a shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>I told them that, had I been there, I should have been the odd man that would have been hit; for they all said that the <rs>Staff</rs> could not well have been arranged again so that there would have been room for a <measure n="3inch" type="distance">three-inch</measure> shot to pass without hitting somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>The cause of the firing was, that the whole line advanced, except the right division, and established a front position at the <rs type="place">Pegram house</rs>. . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>The engineers were trotting round briskly, you may depend, ordering a redoubt here and a battery there, all intent on fencing in our new property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>Luckily, the soil is very light and easy to dig, for our earthworks have now to be measured by miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>Not only must the front be protected, but the exposed flank and the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>With what men we have, we do a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>Since we left <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, I have not seen the troops look so healthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>If we could work a little more backbone into that <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 9">9th Corps</orgName>, it would help wonderfully; but they started green and that is no way to ripen men. Many faults there have been also in the command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2974"/>The men are in good spirits, I think, and well conditioned for the prosecution of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>The evening of Sunday we went to our new camp, having lived nearly <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> in the old <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>Thereat our skirmishers made a counter-rush and drove theirs again away from the house, and our cannon fired and there was a small row generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>Some of our earthworks were really very workmanlike, handsomely sloped in front, and neatly built up with logs in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>It is really a handsome sight to get a view of half a mile of uniform parapet, like this, and see the men's shelter-tents neatly pitched in the pine woods, just in rear, while in front a <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>broad stretch of timber has been <quote>slashed,</quote> to give a good field of fire and break up any body of troops advancing to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>It is quite interesting, too, to see a redoubt going up. The men work after the manner of bees, each at the duty assigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>When we got to the extreme left, he thought he would go out and take a peek at the picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> there was a little bunch of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>They were of a jocose turn; they had found an old pair of wheels whereon they had mounted a keg, making a very good cannon, which pointed, in a threatening manner, down the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>Last night was a busy <num value="1">one</num> and a noisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4143"/>Some battery or other was playing the whole time, and, now and then, they would all wake up at once; while the skirmishers kept rushing at each other and firing, sometimes almost by volleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4144"/>All of which did good, because it wore out the enemy and made them uncertain where the main attack might come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4146"/>the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4147"/>He then swept to the right and left, bearing down all the attempts of the enemy's reserves to check him; a part also of his force went straight forward, crossed the <rs>Boydton</rs> plank and tore up the track of the <orgName n="South Side Railroad" type="railroad">South Side Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>The assault was, in reality, the death-blow to <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0069.0010.00334.02015" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>About <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> the <rs>General</rs> rode off towards the left, from our Headquarters near the crossing of the <placeName reg="Vaughan, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120310">Vaughan</placeName> road, over <placeName reg="Hatchers Run, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2380059">Hatcher's Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>In fact, I completely went ahead of the fly that helped the coach up the hill by bearing down on the spokes of the wheels!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4166"/>And now came the notice that the enemy were going at the double-quick towards their own right, having abandoned the whole of <persName n="Ord,,,,," id="n0069.0010.00336.02030" reg="mostcommon:Ord,Edward,Otho,Cresap,:1"><surname>Ord</surname></persName>'s front and some of <persName n="Humphreys,,,,," id="n0069.0010.00336.02031" reg="mostcommon:Humphreys,Andrew,Atkinson,,:2"><surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>'.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4172"/>About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> we got to <persName n="Humphreys,General,,,," id="n0069.0010.00337.02034" reg="mostcommon:Humphreys,Andrew,Atkinson,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName> on the <rs>Boydton</rs> plank road, by <persName n="Rainie,Mrs.,,,," id="n0069.0010.00337.02035" reg="mostcommon:Rainie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Rainie</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4173"/>He was reported, however, as forming line of battle a mile or <num value="2">two</num> beyond us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4174"/>Still more to our left, the cavalry and the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">5th Corps</orgName> were moving also in a northerly direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4176"/>As soon as <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0069.0010.00337.02041" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Horatio,Gouverneur,,:1"><surname>Wright</surname></persName> found that this part of the field was swept, he <hi rend="italics">again</hi> faced about, as did the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 24">24th Corps</orgName> (now forming his right), and marched directly up the <rs>Boydton</rs> plank to the inner line of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> defences, rested his left on the river, swung the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num> round to join <persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0069.0010.00337.02042" reg="mostcommon:Parke,John,Grubb,,:2"><surname>Parke</surname></persName>, on the right, and <hi rend="italics">voila</hi> the city invested on <name>east</name>, <name>south</name>, and <name>west</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4178"/>By <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> the <rs>General</rs> had got all his troops in motion and properly placed, and the <rs>Staff</rs> had come from the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4179"/>We all started up the plank road, straight towards the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4180"/>It was a strange sensation, to ride briskly past the great oak, near <placeName reg="Arnold Mills, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,2094820">Arnold's Mill</placeName>, where we got so awfully cannonaded at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <placeName reg="Hatchers Run, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2380059">Hatcher's Run</placeName>; then on till we came to the earthwork, on this side of the <rs type="place">Run</rs>, whence <pb id="p.338" n="338"/>came the shot that killed <placeName reg="Charlie Mills">Charlie Mills</placeName>; then across the <rs type="place">Run</rs> itself, passing their line with its abattis and heavy parapet, and so up the road, on the other side, marked by deep ruts of the <rs>Rebel</rs> supply-trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4181"/>As we got to the top of the rise, we struck the open country that surrounds the town, for several miles, and here the road was full of troops, who, catching sight of the <rs>General</rs> trotting briskly by, began to cheer and wave their caps enthusiastically!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4182"/>This continued all along the column, each regiment taking it up in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4183"/>It was a goodly ride, I can tell you!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4185"/>It seemed a deserted building and had been occupied by a Rebel ordnance sergeant, whose papers and returns were lying about in admirable confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4186"/>A moral man was this sergeant, and had left behind a diary, in <num value="1">one</num> page of which he lamented the vice and profanity of his fellow soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4187"/>He was not, however, cleanly, but quite untidy in his domestic arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4188"/>From this spot we had an admirable view of <hi rend="italics">our own works</hi>, as the <rs>Rebels</rs> had, for months, been used to look at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4189"/>There was that tall signal tower, over against us, and the bastions of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and here, near at hand, the <rs>Rebel</rs> line, with its huts and its defenders sorely beleagured over there in the inner lines, against which our batteries were even now playing; and presently <persName n="Gibbon,,,,," id="n0069.0010.00338.02044" reg="mostcommon:Gibbon,John,,,:1"><surname>Gibbon</surname></persName> assaults these <num value="2">two</num> outlying redoubts, and takes them after a fierce fight, losing heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4190"/>In <num value="1">one</num> was a Rebel captain, who told his men to surrender to nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4191"/>He himself fought to the last, and was killed with the butt end of a musket, and most of his command were slain in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4192"/>But we carried the works: neither ditches nor abattis could keep our men out that day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4193"/>You may be sure Miles had not been idle all this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4194"/>Following up the <pb id="p.339" n="339"/><address><street n="Claiborne road">Claiborne road</street></address>, he came on the enemy at <placeName reg="Sutherland's Station">Sutherland's Station</placeName>, entrenched and holding on to cover the escape of their train.

The outskirts are very poor, consisting chiefly of the houses of negroes, who collected, with broad grins, to gaze on the triumphant <rs>Yanks</rs>; while here and there a squalid family of poor whites would lower at us from broken windows, with an air of lazy dislike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4206"/>Near the river, here large enough to carry large steamers, the same closely built business streets, the lower parts of which had suffered severely from our shells; here and there an entire building had been burnt, and everywhere you saw corners knocked off, and shops with all the glass shattered by a shell exploding within.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4207"/>We then returned a little and took a road up the hill towards the famous cemetery ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4208"/><placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, you must understand, lies in a hollow, at the foot of a sort of bluff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/>In fact, this country, is a dead, sandy level, but the water-courses have cut trenches in it, more or less deep according to their volume of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>Thus the <rs>Appomattox</rs> is in a deep trench, while the tributary <quote>runs</quote> that come in are in more shallow trenches; so that the country near the banks looks hilly; when, however, you get on top of these bluffs, you find yourself on a plain, which is more or less worn by water-courses into a succession of rolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>Therefore, from our lines you could only see the spires, because <pb id="p.341" n="341"/>the town was in a gully.
