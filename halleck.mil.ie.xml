<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>They were written without the slightest intention of ever publishing them; but several officers of militia, who heard them delivered, or afterwards read them in manuscript, desire their publication, on the ground of their being useful to a class of officers now likely to be called into military service.

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="1" n="I"><num value="1">1</num></num>: Introduction.&mdash;<persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0053.0002.00007.00006" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>'s arguments on the justifiableness of war briefly examined</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Our distance from the old world, and the favorable circumstances in which we have been placed with respect to the other nations of the new world, have made it so easy for our government to adhere to a pacific policy, that, in the <measure n="62years" type="date">sixty-two years</measure> that have elapsed since the acknowledgment of our national independence, we have enjoyed more than <num value="58">fifty-eight</num> of <rs n="General Peace" type="misc">general peace</rs>; our <name>Indian</name> border wars have been too limited and local in their character to seriously affect the other parts of the country, or to disturb the general conditions of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This fortunate state of things has done much to diffuse knowledge, promote commerce, agriculture, and manufactures; in fine, to increase the greatness of the nation and the happiness of the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Under these circumstances our people have grown up with habits and dispositions essentially pacific, and it is to be hoped that these feelings may not soon be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But in all communities opinions sometimes run into extremes; and there are not a few among us who, dazzled by the beneficial results of a long peace, have adopted the opinion that war in any case is not only useless, but actually immoral; nay, more, that to engage in war is wicked in the highest degree, and even <hi rend="italics">brutish</hi>. <pb id="p.8" n="8"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>All modern ethical writers regard <hi rend="italics">unjust</hi> war as not only immoral, but as <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest of crimes &mdash; murder on a large scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Such are all wars of mere ambition, engaged in for the purpose of extending regal power or national sovereignty; wars of plunder, carried on from mercenary motives; wars of propagandism, undertaken for the unrighteous end of compelling men to adopt certain religious or political opinions, whether from the alleged motives of <quote>introducing a more orthodox religion,</quote> or of <quote>extending the area of freedom.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Such wars are held in just abhorrence by all moral and religious people: and this is believed to be the settled conviction of the great mass of our own citizens.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But in addition to that respectable denomination of Christians who deny our right to use arms under any circumstances, there are many religious enthusiasts in other communions who, from causes already noticed, have adopted the same theory, and hold <hi rend="italics">all</hi> wars, even those in self-defence, as unlawful and immoral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This opinion has been, within the last few years, pressed on the public with great zeal and eloquence, and many able pens have been enlisted in its cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most popular, and by some regarded <num value="1">one</num> of the most able writers on moral science, has adopted this view as the only <num value="1">one</num> consonant with the principles of <name>Christian</name> morality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It has been deemed proper, in commencing a course of lectures on war, to make a few introductory remarks respecting this question of its justifiableness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We know of no better way of doing this than to give on the <num value="1">one</num> side the objections to war as laid down in <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0053.0002.00008.00007" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>'s <persName n="Philosophy,,Moral,,," id="n0053.0002.00008.00008" reg="default:Philosophy,Moral,,,"><foreName>Moral</foreName> <surname>Philosophy</surname></persName>, and on the other side the arguments by which other ethical writers have justified a resort to war. We do not select <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0053.0002.00008.00009" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName>'s work for the purpose of criticizing so distinguished an author; but because he is almost the only writer on ethics who advocates these views, and because <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>the main arguments against war are here given in brief space, and in more moderate and temperate language than that used by most of his followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I shall give his arguments in his own language.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><quote>I. All wars are contrary to the revealed will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is said in reply, that if the <rs>Christian</rs> religion condemns all wars, no matter how just the cause, or how necessary for self-defence, we must expect to find in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> some direct prohibition of war, or at least a prohibition fairly implied in other direct commandments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> nowhere prohibits war: in the Old Testament we find war and even conquest positively commanded, and although war was raging in the world in the time of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0053.0002.00009.00010" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and his apostles, still they said not a word of its unlawfulness and immorality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Moreover, the fathers of the church amply acknowledge the right of war, and directly assert, that when war is justly declared, the <rs>Christian</rs> may engage in it either by stratagem or open force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>If it be of that highly wicked and immoral character which some have recently attributed to it, most assuredly it would be condemned in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> in terms the most positive and unequivocal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But it has been said that the use of the sword is either directly or typically forbidden to the <rs>Christian</rs>, by such passages as <quote>Thou shalt not kill,</quote> (Deut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>v. <num value="17">17</num>,) <quote>I say unto you, that ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also,</quote> (<persName><foreName>Matt</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>v. <num value="39">39</num>,) &amp;c. If these passages are to be taken as literal command s, as fanatics and religious enthusiasts would have us believe, not only is war unlawful, but also all our penal statutes, the magistracy, and all the institutions of the state for the defence of individual rights, the protection of the innocent, and the punishment of the guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But if taken in conjunction with the whole Bible we must infer that they are hyperbolical expressions, used <pb id="p.10" n="10"/>to impress strongly on our minds the <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> of love and forgiveness, and that, so far as possible, we overcome evil with good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Can any sober-minded man suppose, for a moment, that we are commanded to encourage the attacks of the wicked, by literally turning the left cheek when assaulted on the right, and thus induce the assailant to commit more wrong Shall we invite the-thief and the robber to persevere in his depredations, by literally giving him a cloak when he takes our coat; and the insolent and the oppressor to proceed in his path of crime, by going <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> with him if he bid us to go <num value="1">one</num>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Again, if the command, <quote>Thou shalt not kill,</quote> is to be taken literally, it not only prohibits us from engaging in just war, and forbids the taking of human life by the state, as a punishment for crime; it also forbids, says <persName n="Leiber,Doctor,,,," id="n0053.0002.00010.00011" reg="mostcommon:Leiber,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Leiber</surname></persName>, our taking the life of any animal, and even extends to the vegetable kingdom,--for undoubtedly plants have life, and are liable to violent death &mdash; to be <hi rend="italics">killed</hi>. But <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0053.0002.00010.00012" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> concedes to individuals the right to take vegetable and animal life, and to society the right to punish murder by death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This passage undoubtedly means, thou shalt not unjustly kill,--thou shalt do no murder; and so it is rendered in our prayer-books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It cannot have reference to war, for on almost the next page we find the <name>Israelites</name> commanded to go forth and smite the heathen nations,--to cast them out of the land,--to utterly destroy them,--to show them no mercy, &amp;c. If these passages of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> are to be taken literally, there is no book which contains so many contradictions; but if taken in connection with the spirit of other passages, we shall find that we are permitted to use force in preventing or punishing crime, whether in nations or in individuals; but that we should combine love with justice, and free our hearts from all evil motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><pb id="p.11" n="11"/></p> 
<p><num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>All wars are unjustifiable, because <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> commands us to love every man, alien or citizen, Samaritan or Jew, as ourselves; and the act neither of society nor of government can render it our duty to violate this command.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is true that no act of society can make it our duty to violate any command of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>: but is the above command to be taken literally, and as forbidding us to engage in just war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Is it not rather intended to impress upon us, in a forcible manner, that mutual love is a great virtue; that we should hate no <num value="1">one</num>, not even a stranger nor an enemy, but should treat all with justice, mercy, and loving-kindness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>If the meaning attempted to be given to this command in the above quotation be the true <num value="1">one</num>, it is antagonistical not only to just war, but to civil justice, to patriotism, and to the social and domestic affections.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But are we bound to love all human beings alike; that is, to the same degree?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Does the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, as a whole, inculcate such doctrine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>On the contrary, <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0053.0002.00011.00013" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> himself had his <hi rend="italics">beloved</hi> disciple,--<num value="1">one</num> whom he loved pre-eminently, and above all the others; though he loved the others none the less on that account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We are bound to love our parents, our brothers, our families <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and above all other human beings; but we do not, for this reason, love others any the less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A man is not only permitted to seek <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the comfort and happiness of his own family, but if he neglect to do so, he is worse than an infidel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We are bound to protect our families against the attacks of others; and, if necessary for the defence of their lives, we are permitted to take the life of the assailant; nay more, we are bound to do so. But it does not follow that we <hi rend="italics">hate</hi> him whom we thus destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>On the contrary, we may feel compassion, and even love for him. The magistrate sentences the murderer to suffer the penalty of the law; and the sheriff carries the sentence into execution by taking, in due form, the life of the prisoner; <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>nevertheless, both the magistrate and the sheriff may have the kindest feelings towards him whom they thus deprive of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>So it is in the external affairs of the state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Next to my kindred and my neighbors do I love my countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>I love them more than I do foreigners, because my interests, my feelings, my happiness, my ties of friendship and affection, bind me to them more intimately than to the foreigner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I sympathize with the oppressed <rs>Greek</rs>, and the enslaved <rs>African</rs>, and willingly contribute to their relief, although their sufferings affect me very remotely; but if my own countrymen become oppressed and enslaved, nearer and dearer interests are affected, and peculiar duties spring from the ties and affections which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>If my countrymen be oppressed, my neighbors and kindred will be made unhappy and suffering; <hi rend="italics">this</hi> I am bound to take all proper measures in my power to prevent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>If the assailant cannot be persuaded by argument to desist from his wicked intentions, I unite with my fellow-citizens in forcibly resisting his aggressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In doing this I am actuated by no feelings of hatred towards the hostile forces; I have in my heart no malice, no spirit of revenge; I have no desire to harm individuals, except so far as they are made the instruments of oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But as instruments of <hi rend="italics">evil</hi>, I am bound to destroy their power to do harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I do not shoot at my military enemy from hatred or revenge; I fight against him because the paramount interests of my country cannot be secured without destroying the instrument by which they are assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I am prohibited from exercising any personal cruelty; and after the battle, or as soon as the enemy is rendered harmless, he is to be treated with kindness, and to be taken care of equally with the wounded friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>All conduct to the contrary is regarded by civilized nations with disapprobation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><pb id="p.13" n="13"/></p> 
<p>That war does not properly beget personal malignity, but that, on the contrary, the effects of mutual kindness and courtesy on the battle-field, frequently have a beneficial influence in the political events of after years, may be shown by innumerable examples in all history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><persName n="Soult,,,,," id="n0053.0002.00013.00014" reg="mostcommon:Soult,nomatch:0"><surname>Soult</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0053.0002.00013.00015" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> were opposing generals in numerous battles; but when the former visited <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, he was received by <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0053.0002.00013.00016" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> and the whole <name>British</name> nation with &mdash; the highest marks of respect; and the mutual warmth of feeling between these <num value="2">two</num> distinguished men has contributed much to the continuance of friendly relations between the <num value="2">two</num> nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>And a few years ago, when we seemed brought, by our civil authorities, almost to the brink of war by the northeastern boundary difficulties, the pacific arrangements concluded, through the intervention of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0053.0002.00013.00017" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Walter,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, between the <rs>Governors</rs> of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> and <placeName reg="New Brunswick" key="tgn,7005799">New Brunswick</placeName>, were mainly due to ancient friendships contracted by officers of the contending armies during our last war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><num value="3">III</num>. <quote>It is granted that it would be better for man in general, if wars were abolished, and all means, both of offence and defence, abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Now, this seems to me to admit, that this is the law under which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has created man. But this being admitted, the question seems to be at an end; for <name n="God" type="God">God</name> never places man under circumstances in which it is either wise, or necessary, or innocent, to violate his laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Is it for the advantage of him who lives among a community of thieves, to steal; or for <num value="1">one</num> who lives among a community of liars, to lie?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The fallacy of the above argument is so evident that it is scarcely necessary to point out its logical defects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>My living among a community of thieves would not justify me in stealing, and certainly it would be no reason why I should neglect the security of my property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>My living among murderers would not justify me in committing <pb id="p.14" n="14"/>murder, and on the other hand it would be no reason why I should not fight in the defence of my family, if the arm of the law were unable to protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>That other nations carry on unjust wars is no reason why we should do likewise, nor is it of itself any reason why we should neglect the means of self-defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It may seem, to us short-sighted mortals, better that we were placed in a world where there were no wars, or murders, or thefts; but <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has seen fit to order it otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Our duties and our relations to our fellow-men are made to suit the world as it is, and not such a world as we would make for ourselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We live among thieves: we must therefore resort to force to protect our property &mdash; that is, to locks, and bars, and bolts; we build walls thick and high between the robber and our merchandise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>And more: we enact laws <hi rend="italics">for</hi> his punishment, and employ civil officers to forcibly seize the guilty and inflict that degree of punishment necessary for the prevention of other thefts and robberies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>We live among murderers: if neither the law nor the ordinary physical protections suffice for the defence of our own lives and the lives of our innocent friends, we forcibly resist the murderer, even to his death, if need be. Moreover, to deter others from like crimes, we inflict the punishment of death upon him who has already taken life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>These relations of individuals and of society are laid down by all ethical writers as in accordance with the strictest rules of <name>Christian</name> morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Even <persName n="Wayland,Doctor,,,," id="n0053.0002.00014.00018" reg="mostcommon:Wayland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wayland</surname></persName> considers it not only the right, but the duty of individuals and of society to resort to these means, and to enact these laws for self-protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Let us extend the same course of reasoning to the relations of different societies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We live among nations who frequently wage unjust wars; who, disregarding the rights of others, oppress, <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>and rob, and even murder their citizens, in order to reach some unrighteous end. As individuals, we build fences and walls for the protection of our grounds and our merchandise; so, as a nation, we build ships and forts to protect our commerce, our harbors, and our cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But the walls of our houses and stores are useless, unless made so strong and high that the robber cannot break through or scale them without great effort and personal danger; so our national ships and forts would be utterly useless for protection, unless fully armed and equipped.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Further: as individuals and as societies we employ civil officers for the protection of our property and lives, and, when necessary, arm them with the physical means of executing the laws, even though the employment of these means should cost human life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The prevention and punishment of crime causes much human suffering; nevertheless the good of community requires that crime should be prevented and punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>So, as a nation, we employ military officers to man our ships and forts, to protect our property and our persons, and to repel and punish those who seek to rob us of our life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>National aggressions are far more terrible in their results than individual crime; so also the means of prevention and punishment are far more stupendous, and the employment of these means causes a far greater amount of human suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>This may be a good reason.. for greater <hi rend="italics">caution</hi> in resorting to such means, but assuredly it is no argument against the <hi rend="italics">moral right</hi> to use them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="4">IV</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>War is unjustifiable because unnecessary:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><quote><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The very fact that a nation relied solely upon the justice of its measures, and the benevolence of its conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>would do more than any thing else to prevent the occurrence of injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Then, the halls of congress were frequently filled with demagogues, and tiplers, and the <hi rend="italics">small men</hi> of community: now, the ablest and best of the country are always sought for as representatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Then, the rank and file of party were mere political hirelings, who sold their manhood for place, who reviled and glorified, and shouted huzzas and whispered calumnies, just as they were bidden; they could fawn upon those who dispensed political patronage with a cringing servility that would shame the courtiers of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>., or the parasites and hirelings of <persName n="Walpole,,,,," id="n0053.0002.00025.00031" reg="mostcommon:Walpole,nomatch:0"><surname>Walpole</surname></persName>: now, all political partisans, deriving their moral tone from the piping times of peace, are pure, disinterested patriots, who, like the <rs>Roman</rs> farmer, take office with great reluctance, and resign it again as soon as the state can spare their services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Nay, more, some even go so far as to say that our army, as a body, is no less moral than the corresponding classes in civil life; that our common soldiers are as seldom guilty of riots, thefts, robberies, and murders, as similarly educated men engaged in other pursuits; that our military officers are not inferior in moral character to our civil officers, and that, as a class, they will compare favorably with any other class of professional men &mdash; with lawyers, for example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In justification of these opinions &mdash; which may, perhaps, be deemed singularly erroneous &mdash; they say, that in the many <num value="1000000">millions</num> of public money expended during the last <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, by military officers, for the army, for military defences, and for internal improvements, but a single graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> has proved a defaulter, even to the smallest sum, and that it is exceedingly rare to see an officer of the army brought into court for violating the laws.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>With respect to our own country, the entire amounts expended, under the head of <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName>, whether for <name>Indian</name> pensions, for the purchase of <name>Indian</name> lands, the construction of government roads, the improvement of rivers and harbors, the building of break-waters and sea-walls, for the preservation of property, the surveying of public lands, &amp;c., &amp;c.; in fine, every expenditure made by officers of the army, under the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName>, is put down as <quote>expenses for military defence.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/><pb id="p.27" n="27"/>Similar misstatements are made with respect to foreign countries: for example, the new fortifications of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> are said to have already cost from <num value="50000000">fifty</num> to <num value="75000000">seventy-five millions</num> of dollars, and as much more is said to be required to complete them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Indeed, we have seen the whole estimated cost of those works stated at <num value="240000000">two hundred and forty millions</num> of dollars, or <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of francs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The facts are these: the works, when done, will have cost about <num value="28000000">twenty-eight millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>We had the pleasure of examining them not long since, in company with several of the engineer officers employed on the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>They were then <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> done, and had cost about <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We were assured by these officers that the fortifications proper would be completed for somewhat less than the original estimate of <num value="28000000">twenty-eight millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Had we time to enter into details, other examples of exaggeration and misrepresentation could be given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>But it is not to be denied that wars and the means of military defence have cost vast amounts of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>So also have litigation and the means deemed requisite for maintaining justice between individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It has been estimated that we have in this country, at the present time, <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> lawyers, without including pettifoggers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Allowing each of these to cost the country the average sum of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure>, and we have the annual cost to the country, for lawyers, <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Add to this the cost of legislative halls and legislators for making laws; of court-houses, jails, police-offices, judges of the different courts, marshals, sheriffs, justices of the peace, constables, clerks, witnesses, &amp;c., employed to apply and enforce the laws when made; the personal loss of time of the different plaintiffs and defendants, the individual anxiety and suffering produced by litigation; add all these together, and I doubt not the result for a single year will somewhat astonish these modern <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>economists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>But if all the expenditures of this nature that have been made for the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, in this individual <quote>war of hate,</quote> be added together, we have no doubt a very fruitful text might be obtained for preaching a crusade against law and lawyers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But could any sane man be found to say that, on account of the cost of maintaining them, all laws and lawyers are useless and should be abolished?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>If, therefore, these vast sums of money are deemed necessary to secure justice between individuals of the same nation, can we expect that the means of international justice can be maintained without expenditures commensurate with the object in view?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>If we cannot rely exclusively upon the <quote>law of active benevolence</quote> for maintaining justice between brothers of the same country, can we hope that, in the present state of the world, strangers and foreigners will be more ready to comply with its requisitions?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The length of the preceding remarks admonishes us to greater brevity in the further discussion of this subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It is objected to war, that men being rational beings, should contend with <num value="1">one</num> another by argument, and not by force, as do the brutes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>To this it is answered, that force properly begins only where argument ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>If he who has wronged me cannot be persuaded to make restitution, I apply to the court,--that is, to <hi rend="italics">legal</hi> force,--to compel him to do me justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>So nations ought to resort to <hi rend="italics">military force</hi> only when all other means fail to prevent aggression and injury.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>But war often fails to procure redress of grievances, or to prevent repeated and continued aggression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>So does a resort to civil force; but such a resort is none the less proper and just on that account.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>But in war the innocent party is sometimes the sufferer, while the guilty triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/><pb id="p.29" n="29"/></p> 
<p>So it often is in civil life: <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, for some wise purpose, sometimes permits the wicked to triumph for a season.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>But in all wars <num value="1">one</num> party must be in the wrong, and frequently the war is unjust on both sides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>So in suits at law, <num value="1">one</num> party is necessarily wrong, and frequently both resort to the civil tribunals in hopes of attaining unrighteous ends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>But nations do not resort to tribunals, like individuals, to settle their differences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>For the reason that it is believed a tribunal of this character &mdash; a congress of nations, as it has been called,--would be more productive of evil than of good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>By such an arrangement the old and powerful <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> monarchies would acquire the authority to interfere in the domestic affairs of the weaker powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>We see the effects of establishing such a tribunal in the so-called Holy Alliance, whose influence is regarded by the friends of liberty as little less dangerous than the <rs>Holy Inquisition</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Moreover, such a tribunal would not prevent war, for military force would still be resorted to to enforce its decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>For these and other reasons, it is deemed better and safer to rely on the present system of International Law. Under this system, and in this country, a resort to the arbitrament of war is not the result of impulse and passion,--a yielding to the mere <quote>bestial propensities</quote> of our nature; it is a deliberate and solemn act of the legislative power,--of the representatives of the national mind, convened as the high council of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It is this power which must determine when all just and honorable means have been resorted to to obtain national justice, and when a resort to military force is requisite and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>If this decision be necessarily unchristian and barbarous, such, also, should we expect to be the character of other laws passed by the same body, and under the same circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>A declaration <pb id="p.30" n="30"/>of war, in this country, is a law of the land, made by a deliberative body, under the high sanction of the constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is true that such a law may be unjust and wrong, but we can scarcely agree that it will necessarily be so. The distinction between war, as thus duly declared, and <quote>international Lynch-law</quote> is too evident to need comment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But it is said that the benefits of war are more than counterbalanced by the evils it entails, and that, <quote>most commonly, the very means by which we repel a despotism from abroad, only establishes over us a military despotism at home.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Much has been said and written about <hi rend="italics">military</hi> despotism; but we think he who studies history thoroughly, will not fail to prefer a military despotism to a despotism of mere politicians.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is not the present intention to enter into any discussion of these different kinds of war, but rather to consider the general subject, and to discuss such general principles and rules as may be applicable to all wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/><pb id="p.37" n="37"/></p> 
<p>War in its most extensive sense may be regarded both as a <hi rend="italics">science</hi> and an <hi rend="italics">art</hi>. It is a science so far as it investigates general principles and institutes an analysis of military operations; and an art when considered with reference to the practical rules for conducting campaigns, sieges, battles, &amp;c. So is engineering a science so far as it investigates the general principles of fortification, and also artillery, in analyzing the principles of gunnery; but both are arts when considered with reference to the practical rules for the construction, attack, and defence of forts, or for the use of cannon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>This distinction has not always been observed by writers on this subject, and some have asserted that strategy is the <hi rend="italics">science</hi>, and tactics the <hi rend="italics">art</hi> of war. This is evidently mistaking the general distinction between science, which investigates principles, and art, which forms practical rules.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>In popular language, however, it is usual to speak of <hi rend="italics">the military art</hi> when we refer to the general subject of war, and of <hi rend="italics">the military sciences</hi> when we wish to call attention more particularly to the scientific principles upon which the art is founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>We shall here consider the military art in this general sense, as including the entire subject of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>As thus defined, the military art may be divided into <num value="4">four</num> distinct branches, viz.: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>. <hi rend="italics">Strategy</hi>; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Fortification, or <hi rend="italics">Engineering</hi>; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>. <hi rend="italics">Logistics; <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Tactics</hi>. Several general treatises on this art add another branch, called <hi rend="italics">The Policy of War</hi>, or the relations of war with the affairs of state.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/><hi rend="italics">Strategy</hi> is defined to be the art of directing masses on decisive points, or the hostile movements of armies beyond the range of each other's cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/><hi rend="italics">Engineering</hi> embraces all dispositions made to enable troops to resist a superior force the longest time possible; and also the <pb id="p.38" n="38"/>means resorted to by the opposing army to overcome these material obstacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/><hi rend="italics">Logistics</hi> embraces the practical details of moving and supplying armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><hi rend="italics">Tactics is</hi> the art of bringing troops into action, or of moving them in the presence of an enemy, that is, within his view, and within the reach of his artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>All these are most intimately connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>A fault in tactics may occasion the loss of strategic lines; the best combined manoeuvres on the field of battle may lead to no decisive results, when the position, or the direction of the operation is not strategic; sometimes not only battles, but entire campaigns, are lost through neglect of the engineer's art, or faults in his dispositions; again, armies would be of little use without the requisite means of locomotion and of subsistence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>I. <hi rend="italics">Strategy</hi> regards the theatre of war, rather than the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It selects the important points in this theatre, and the lines of communication by which they may be reached; it forms the plan and arranges the general operations of a campaign; but it leaves it to the engineers to overcome material obstacles and to erect new ones; it leaves to logistics the means of supporting armies and of moving them on the chosen lines; and to tactics, the particular dispositions for battle, when the armies have reached the destined points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It is well to keep in mind these distinctions, which may be rendered still more obvious by a few illustrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The point where several lines of communications either intersect or meet, and the centre of an are which is occupied by the enemy, are strategic points; but tactics would reject a position equally accessible on all sides, especially with its flanks exposed to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Sempronius at Trebbia and <persName n="Varro,,,,," id="n0053.0003.00038.00064" reg="mostcommon:Varro,nomatch:0"><surname>Varro</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Canne, Bari, Puglia" key="tgn,7009090">Cannae</placeName>, so placed their armies that the <name>Carthagenians</name> attacked them, at the same time, in front, on the flanks, and in rear; the <rs>Roman</rs> consuls were defeated: but the central strategic position of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0003.00038.00065" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Memoires,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7005763" n="1.000 10" reg="Rivoli,Torino,Piemonte,Italia,Europe">Rivoli</placeName> <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>was eminently successful.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>War, as has already been said, may be either offensive or defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>If the attacking army be directed against an entire state, it becomes a war of <hi rend="italics">invasion</hi>. If only a province, or a military position, or an army, be attacked, it is simply regarded as taking the <hi rend="italics">initiative</hi> in offensive movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/><hi rend="italics">Offensive</hi> war is ordinarily most advantageous in its moral and political influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>It is waged on a foreign soil, and therefore spares the country of the attacking force; it augments its own resources at the same time that it diminishes those of the enemy; it adds to the moral courage of its own army, while it disheartens its opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>A war of invasion may, however, have also its disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Its lines of operation may become too <hi rend="italics">deep</hi>, which is always hazardous in an enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>All the natural and artificial obstacles, such as mountains, rivers, defiles, fortifications, &amp;c., are favorable for defence, but difficult to be overcome by the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The local authorities and inhabitants oppose, instead of facilitating his operations; and if patriotism animate the <pb id="p.40" n="40"/>defensive army to fight for the independence of its threatened country, the war may become long and bloody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But if a political diversion be made in favor of the invading force, and its operations be attended with success, it strikes the enemy at the heart, paralyzes all his military energies, and deprives him of his military resources, thus promptly terminating the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Regarded simply as the initiative of movements, the offensive is almost always the preferable <num value="1">one</num>, as it enables the general to choose his lines for moving and concentrating his masses on the decisive point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most important rule in offensive war is, to keep your forces as much concentrated as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>This will not only prevent misfortune, but secure victory,--since, by its necessary operation, you possess the power of throwing your whole force upon any exposed point of your enemy's position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>To this general rule some writers have laid down the following exceptions:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>When the food and forage of the neighborhood in which you act have been exhausted and destroyed, and your magazines are, from any cause, unable to supply the deficiency, <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> things must be done; either you must go to places where these articles abound, or you must draw from them your supplies by <hi rend="italics">detachments</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>When reinforcements are about to join you, and this can only be effected by a march through a country actually occupied by hostile corps, or liable to be so occupied, you must again waive the general rule, and risk <num value="1">one</num> party for the security of the other; or, (which may be better,) make such movements with your main body as shall accomplish your object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>When you have complete evidence of the actual, or probable insurrection in your favor, of a town or province of your enemy, or of a division of his army, you must support this inclination by strong <hi rend="italics">detachments</hi>, or by movements of your main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>This rule does not require that <hi rend="italics">all the army should occupy the same position</hi>. Far from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>To change the line of operations, in the middle of a campaign, and follow <hi rend="italics">accidental lines</hi>, is always a delicate affair, and can only be resorted to by a general of great skill, and with disciplined troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>This maxim, however, must sometimes be disregarded by an army of undisciplined troops, in order to avoid entire destruction; but the total abandonment of a line of operations is always attended with great loss, and should be regarded as a mere choice of evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>A regular army can always avoid this result, by changing the direction of its line; thus frequently gaining superior advantages in the new theatre of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>If the plan of this change be the result of a good <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi>, and it be skilfully executed, the rear of the operating army will be secure from the enemy; and moreover, he will be left in doubt respecting its weak points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>If the army be of incongruous materials, generally a change of direction will be less advantageous than to entirely abandon the line, and save as many as possible of the troops for some new plan of operations.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Having explained the principal terms used in strategy, let us trace out the successive operations of war in their usual strategic relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>We will suppose war to be declared, and the army to be just entering upon a campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>The political and military authorities of the state determine upon the nature of the war, and select the theatre of its enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The chief selects certain points, on or near the borders of the seat of war, where his troops are to be assembled, and his <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>These points, together, form his base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>He now selects some point, within the theatre of the war, as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object of his enterprises, and chooses the line of operations most advantageous for reaching this objective point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The temporary positions taken on this line become strategic positions, and the line in his rear, a line of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>When he arrives in the vicinity of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object, and the enemy begins to oppose his enterprises, he must force this enemy to retreat, either by an attack or by manoeuvres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>For this purpose he temporarily adopts certain lines of manoeuvre, which may deviate from his general line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The ulterior events of the campaign may possibly cause him to make these new, or accidental lines, his lines of operations, The approach of hostile forces may cause him to detach <pb id="p.57" n="57"/>secondary corps on secondary lines; or to divide his army, and pursue double or multiple lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>The primitive object may also be relinquished, and new ones proposed, with new lines and new plans of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>As he advances far from his primitive base, he forms new depots and lines of magazines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>He may encounter natural and artificial obstacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>To cross large rivers in the face of an enemy is a hazardous operation; and he requires all the art of the engineer in constructing bridges, and securing a safe passage for his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>If a fortified place is to be taken, he will detach a siege corps, and either continue his march with the main army, or take a strategic position to cover this siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Thus <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0003.00057.00106" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Memoires,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, with an army of only <num value="50000">50,000</num> combatants, could not venture to penetrate into <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, with <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName> and its garrison of <num value="25000">25,000</num> men in his rear, and an Austrian force of <num value="40000">40,000</num> before him. But in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> the great superiority of his army enabled him to detach forces to besiege the principal fortresses of <placeName key="tgn,7007552" n="1.000 5" reg="silesia">Silesia</placeName>, and still to continue his operations with his principal forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>The chief of the army may meet the enemy under circumstances such as to induce or compel him to give battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>If he should be victorious, the enemy must be pursued and harassed to the uttermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>If he should be defeated, he must form the best plan, and provide the best means of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>If possible, he must take shelter in some line of fortifications, and prepare to resume the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Lines of retrenchment and temporary works may sometimes serve him as a sufficient protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>Finally, when the unfavorable season compels him to suspend his operations, he will go into winter cantonments, and prepare for a new campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Such are the ordinary operations of war: its relations to strategy must be evident, even to the most superficial reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/><pb id="p.58" n="58"/></p> 
<p>Not unfrequently the results of a campaign depend more upon the strategic operations of an army, than upon its victories gained in actual combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Tactics, or movements within the range of the enemy's cannon, is therefore subordinate to the <hi rend="italics">choice of positions</hi>: if the field of battle be properly chosen, success will be decisive, and the loss of the battle not disastrous; whereas, if selected without reference to the principles of the science, the victory, if gained, might be barren, and defeat, if suffered, totally fatal: thus demonstrating the truth of <placeName key="tgn,2080924;tgn,2165488;tgn,2007681" n="0.035 000000.2480	placename;tgn,2080924;napoleon, henry, ohio,Henry,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.007 000000.0496	placename;tgn,2165488;Beulah Island Landing, Desha, Arkansas,Desha,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;0.007 000000.0496	placename;tgn,2007681;Napoleon, Independence, Arkansas,Independence,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="napoleon, henry, ohio,Henry,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Beulah Island Landing, Desha, Arkansas,Desha,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;Napoleon, Independence, Arkansas,Independence,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America">Napoleon</placeName>'s maxim, that success is oftener due to the genius of the general, and to the nature of the theatre of war, than to the number and bravery of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>(Maxim <num value="17">17</num>, <num value="18">18</num>.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>We have a striking illustration of this in the <rs>French</rs> army of the <rs>Danube</rs>, which, from the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of <persName n="Kray,General,,,," id="n0053.0003.00058.00107" reg="mostcommon:Kray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kray</surname></persName>, marched rapidly through <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> to the right extremity of the <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> line, <quote>and by this movement alone conquered all the country between the <rs>Rhine</rs> and <rs>Danube</rs> without pulling a trigger.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>To a defensive army fortifications are valuable as points of repose, upon which the troops, if beaten, may fall back, and shelter their sick and wounded, collect their scattered forces, repair their materials, and draw together a new supply of stores and provisions; and as rallying points, where new troops may be assembled with safety, and the army, in a few days, be prepared to again meet the enemy in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Without these defences, undisciplined and inexperienced armies, when once routed, can seldom be rallied again, except with great losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>But when supported by forts, they can select their opportunity for fighting, and offer or refuse <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>battle according to the probability of success; and, having a safe place of retreat, they are far less influenced by fear in the actual conflict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The enemy, on the other hand, being compelled either to besiege or <hi rend="italics">observe</hi> these works, his army will be separated from its magazines, its strength and efficiency diminished by detachments, and his whole force exposed to the horrors of partisan warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>It has therefore been estimated by the best military writers, that an army supported by a judicious system of fortifications, can repel a land force <hi rend="italics"><num value="6">six</num></hi> times as large as itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Every government should prepare, in time of peace, its most prominent and durable means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>By securing in a permanent manner its important points, it will enable a small force to retain possession of these places against a greatly superior army, for a considerable length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>This serves the same purpose as a battle gained; for, in the beginning of a war of invasion, the economy of time is of the utmost importance to the defensive party, enabling it to organize and prepare the great military resources of the state.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>In all mountainous frontiers, or sides of states bordering on large rivers, or chains of lakes, there will necessarily be but few points by which an invader can penetrate into the interior of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Let us suppose that, for a frontier of moderate extent there are <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num></hi> passes, or avenues through which the enemy may approach the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>To effectually defend these approaches against the invading army will require, for each, an army of <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men. Not being able to decide positively on the plans of the enemy, all these communications must be defended at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>This requires a defending army of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men. Let us now suppose each of these passes to be fortified in such a way, that <num value="1000">one thousand</num> men will be able to hold the <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>enemy in check, and force him to resort to the operations of a siege; or, at least, to retard his advance till an active army can be organized in the interior, and prepared to meet him in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>We here see that <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men, by means of fortifications, can accomplish the same defensive object as <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men without these artificial means of security.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>But let us enter a little more into the details of frontier defences, and examine the character of the several systems which have been successively proposed or adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Frontiers are divided into <num value="4">four</num> distinct classes, according as the state may be open on <num value="1">one</num> or more sides, or bounded by mountains, large rivers and lakes, or by the sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>An open frontier is the most difficult of defence; and while there exists a perfect uniformity among military men upon the vast importance of fortifying such a frontier, there is an equal diversity of opinion respecting the best manner of arranging these works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>We shall here mention <num value="3">three</num> general systems of arranging forts for the defence of an open country, each of which has been advocated at different times, and afterwards received various modifications and additions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>These <num value="3">three</num> systems comprise the main features of all others worthy of much consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>They are:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The system of continuous lines, proposed by <persName n="Montalembert,,,,," id="n0053.0004.00066.00177" reg="mostcommon:Montalembert,nomatch:0"><surname>Montalembert</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>A system of <num value="3">three</num> lines of detached works, strongly recommended by D'Arcon and others.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these systems was proposed in <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, and for a time attracted considerable notice in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 15" reg="france">France</placeName>, but has long since been discarded, as being utterly incompatible <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>with the principles of the military art. A writer, however, of some pretensions in this country, recommends its adoption for the defence of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and the shores of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The same author would dispense entirely with our present system of fortifications on the sea-coast, and substitute in their place wooden <placeName key="tgn,1045286" n="1.000 1" reg="martello,bolzano,trentino-alto adige,italia,europe">Martello</placeName> towers!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> system, the works on the extreme frontier are to be placed about <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> apart, and those of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> lines respectively <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> in rear of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> lines, and opposite the intervals.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>For mountainous frontiers it is deemed necessary to secure all the important passes with small redoubts or military works, and to defend with strong forts the grand interior strategic points on which these communications <pb id="p.68" n="68"/>are directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>For a frontier of moderate extent there may be some <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> gorges in the mountains by which an army might penetrate; but it will always be found that these roads concentrate on <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> points in the great valleys below.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Omitting for the present all discussion of seacoast defences, let us examine more particularly the character and influence of fortifications on land frontiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>All military writers agree that fortifications have heretofore exerted a great, and frequently a decisive, influence on the operations of a war. Those of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 15" reg="france">France</placeName> are frequently referred to as proofs of this influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>But, while all are disposed to allow that these works contributed much in former times to the defence of states, yet some have said that modern improvements in the mode of attack have rendered forts far less valuable than formerly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/><num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>We have defined <hi rend="italics">logistics</hi> to be that branch of the military art which embraces all the practical details of moving and supplying armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>The term is derived from the title of a French general officer, (<hi rend="italics">major-general des logis</hi>,) who was formerly charged with directing the marches, encampments, and lodging of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>It has been still further extended by recent military writers, and many of them now regard logistics as a distinct and important branch of the art.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>We shall here consider logistics as including the military duties ordinarily attributed to the pay, subsistence, clothing, medical, hospital, and transportation departments; in fine, of all the civil and civico-military corps of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>We shall therefore discuss under this head, the preparation of all the necessary materials for fitting out troops for a campaign and for putting them in motion; the regulating of marches, convoys, the means of transport for provisions, hospitals, munitions, and supplies of all kinds; the preparation and protection of magazines; the laying out of camps and cantonments; in fine, every thing connected with preparing, moving, and guarding the <hi rend="italics">impedimenta</hi> of an army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>The officers connected with this branch of service must consult with the engineers in every thing relating to the defence of their depots, magazines, camps, cantonments, communications, and the passage of rivers, and in all that relates to their connection with the attack and defence of places: but in all that relates to strategy and <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>tactics they must receive instructions directly from the chief of the staff of the army, who will have the general direction of every thing connected with logistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/><hi rend="italics">Subsistence</hi>.--The art of subsisting troops during active operations in a hostile country, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult subjects connected with war; and it is a question well worthy of study, both for the statesman and the warrior, how <persName><foreName>Darius</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00089.00260" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00089.00261" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, in ancient times &mdash; and the <name>Greek</name> emperors and the barbarians &mdash; and, later still, the crusaders of the middle ages, contrived to support the immense masses of men which they led to war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Others have adopted either in part or entirely the principle of regular magazines.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>fought mostly on their own frontiers, and followed the system of regular depots and supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>But the revolutionary armies of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 15" reg="france">France</placeName> made war without magazines, subsisting, sometimes on the inhabitants, sometimes by requisitions levied on the country passed over, and at others by pillage and marauding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00089.00263" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Histoire,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> found little difficulty in supporting an <pb id="p.90" n="90"/>army of a <num value="100">hundred</num> or a <num value="120000">hundred and twenty thousand</num> men in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, Suabia, and on the rich borders of the <rs>Rhine</rs> and the <rs>Danube</rs>; but in <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, the subject of subsistence became <num value="1">one</num> of extreme embarrassment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>All depots of provisions and other supplies for an army are denominated <hi rend="italics">magazines</hi>; these are divided into <hi rend="italics">principal, secondary</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">provisional</hi>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> are usually on the base of operations; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, on the line of operations; and the last in the immediate vicinity of the troops, and contain supplies for a few days only.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>The system of <hi rend="italics">magazines</hi> is objected to by some, because it fetters the movements of an army, and makes its military operations subordinate to the means of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Moreover, as the movements of an army must be so arranged as to cover these magazines, their establishment at given points reveals to the enemy our plan of campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>On the other hand, the system of <hi rend="italics">requisitions</hi>, either for immediate supplies or for secondary magazines, gives far greater velocity and impetuosity to an active army; and if it be so regulated as to repress pillage, and be levied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>with uniformity and moderation, it may be relied on with safety in well-cultivated countries; but in more barren and less populous districts, an army without magazines, especially in case of a prolonged stay or a forced retreat, will be exposed to great suffering and loss, if not to total destruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Before commencing a campaign the general should make himself acquainted with all the resources of the country to be passed over &mdash; determine the amount of supplies which it may be necessary to take with him, and the amount that can be obtained by requisitions; these requisitions being levied in a uniform and legal manner, and through the existing local authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/><pb id="p.91" n="91"/></p> 
<p>In great wars of invasion it is sometimes impracticable, at least for a time, to provide for the immense forces placed on foot, by any regular system of magazines or of ordinary requisitions: in such cases their subsistence is entirely intrusted to the troops themselves, who levy contributions wherever they pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>The inevitable consequences of this system are universal pillage and a total relaxation of discipline; the loss of private property and the violation of individual rights, are followed by the massacre of all straggling parties, and the ordinary peaceful and non-combatant inhabitants are converted into bitter and implacable enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>In this connection the war in the <rs>Spanish</rs> peninsula is well worthy of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>At the beginning of this war <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00091.00264" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Histoire,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had to choose between methodical operations, with provisions carried in the train of his army, or purchased of the inhabitants and regularly paid for; and irregular warfare, with forced requisitions.--war being made to support war. The question was thoroughly discussed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand, by sacrificing <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of francs from the <rs>French</rs> treasury, he would have been able to support his troops without requisitions, would have maintained good order and discipline in his armies, and by the distribution of this money among a people poor and interested, he would have made many partisans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>He could then have offered them, with a firm and just hand, the olive or the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>But then the drafts upon the <rs>French</rs> treasury, had the war been a protracted <num value="1">one</num>, would have been enormous for the support of an army of <num value="200000">200,000</num> men in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 10" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>Moreover, the hostile and insurrectionary state of the local authorities rendered regular and legal requisitions almost impossible; and the want of navigable rivers, good roads, and suitable transport, rendered problematical the possibility of moving a sufficient quantity of stores in an insurrectionary country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/><pb id="p.92" n="92"/>Besides, no great detachments could have been made to regulate the administration of the provinces, or to pursue the insurgent corps into the fastnesses of the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>In fine, by this system, he would have effected a military occupation of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 10" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> without its subjugation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>On the other hand, by marching rapidly against all organized masses, living from day to day upon the local resources of the country, as he had done in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, sparing his reserves for the occupation and pacification of the conquered provinces; this mode promised more prompt and decisive results than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00092.00265" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Histoire,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, therefore, determined to adopt it for his active masses, employing the system of magazines and regular requisitions so far as practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>In favorable parts of the country, <persName n="Soult,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00092.00266" reg="mostcommon:Soult,nomatch:0"><surname>Soult</surname></persName> and Souchet, with smaller armies, succeeded in obtaining in this way regular supplies for a considerable length of time, but the others lived mainly by forced requisitions levied as necessity required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>This sometimes gave place to great excesses, but these were principally the faults of subordinate officers who tolerated them, rather than of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0005.00092.00267" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Histoire,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, who punished such breaches of discipline, when they were known to him, with great severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>He afterwards declared that, <quote>had he succeeded he would have indemnified the great mass of the <rs>Spanish</rs> people for their losses, by the sale of the hoarded wealth of the clergy, which would have rendered the church less powerful, and caused a more just division of property; thus the evil of the war would have been forgotten in the happy triumph of public and private interest over the interest of an ambitious and exclusive clergy.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/><hi rend="italics">Forage</hi> is a military term applied to food of any kind for horses or cattle,--as grass, hay, corn, oats, &amp;c.; and also to the operation of collecting such food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>Forage is of <num value="2">two</num> kinds, <hi rend="italics">green</hi> and <hi rend="italics">dry</hi>; the former being collected directly from the meadows and harvest-fields, and the latter from the barns and granaries of the farmers, or the storehouses of the dealers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>The animals connected with an army may be subsisted by regular magazines, by forced requisitions, or by authorized <hi rend="italics">foraging</hi>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/> 
<p>This term is sometimes, though improperly, applied to the operation of forcibly collecting food for the troops.</p></note> As has already been remarked, it is not always politic, or even possible, to provide regular magazines for the entire supplies of an army during the active operations of a <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>On account of the great expense and difficulty of transporting forage, the general of an army is more frequently under the necessity of resorting to requisitions, or forced contributions as they are called, and to foraging, for the subsistence of his animals, than to provide food for his men. Nor are requisitions and foragings for this object so objectionable as in the other case, being far less likely to produce general want and distress among the non-combatant inhabitants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>The <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of troops should always use his best endeavors to obtain his forage by purchase of the inhabitants, or by requisitions on the local authorities; and even where these means are impracticable, the foraging parties should be strictly directed to make their levies with uniformity and due moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Accurate accounts should be kept of the kinds and quantities of all produce and other property taken, so that it may be regularly distributed and accounted for. Under no circumstances should individuals be permitted to appropriate to themselves more than their <hi rend="italics">pro rata</hi> allowance Foraging parties may sometimes attain their object in a peaceful manner, by representing to the inhabitants the nature of their instructions and the necessity of obtaining immediate supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>Even where no recompense is proposed, it may be well to offer certificates to the effect that such articles have been taken for the use of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>These certificates, even when of no value in themselves, frequently tend to appease excited passions and allay insurrections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>In defensive war, carried on in <num value="1">one</num>'s own country, it is often necessary to seize upon private property and appropriate it to the public service: in all such cases the certificates of the foraging officers become proofs of individual claims against the government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>No foraging party should ever be sent out till after the country has been properly reconnoitred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>A good military <pb id="p.96" n="96"/>escort and vanguard should always accompany and precede the foragers, for protection against the enemy's light cavalry and an insurgent militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Trustworthy troops must be placed in the villages and hamlets of the country to be foraged, in order to prevent the foragers from engaging in irregular and unauthorized pillage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/><rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officers</rs> of the staff and administrative corps are sent with the party to see to the proper execution of the orders, and to report any irregularities on the part of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>In case any corps engage in unauthorized pillage, due restitution should be made to the inhabitants, and the expense of such restitution deducted from the pay and allowances of the corps by whom such excess is committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>A few examples of this kind of justice will soon restore discipline to the army, and pacify the inhabitants of the country occupied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Experience is the best guide in estimating the amount of hay or grain that may be taken from a given field: the produce of an acre is, of course, very different for different soils and climates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>In distributing the burdens to the several pack-horses and wagons employed in conveying the forage to the army, it is important for the foraging officers to know the relative weight and bulk of each article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>As it would be exceedingly dangerous to send forward the regular train of the army for the conveyance of forage collected by these foraging parties, the country wagons <pb id="p.97" n="97"/>and pack-horses are usually pressed into service for this purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Troops of horse are sometimes sent into the vicinity of meadows and grain-fields for temporary subsistence: in such cases the horses and cattle may be farmed in the neighborhood, and the grass and grain issued in regular rations, immediately as taken from the field; but in no case should the animals be turned out to pasture.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>The term is sometimes more extensively used to include all the means for lodging and sheltering the soldiers during a campaign, and all the arrangements for cooking, &amp;c., either in the field or in winter quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>A camp, whether composed of tents <pb id="p.106" n="106"/>or barracks, or merely places assigned for bivouacking, must be divided and arranged in such a way that the several divisions shall be disposed as they are intended to be drawn up in order of battle; so that, on any sudden alarm, the troops can pass from it promptly, and form their line of battle without confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Suitable places must also be assigned for cooking, for baggage, and for provisions, military stores, and ammunitions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>The extent of the color front of a camp depends much on the character of the ground and the means of defence, but as a general rule, it should never exceed the position which the army would occupy in the line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>The different arms should be encamped in the same order as that of battle; this order of course depending on the nature of the battle-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>A <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi> is composed of battalions of infantry, squadrons of cavalry, batteries of artillery, and companies of engineer troops, and the art of encampments consists in arranging each of these elements so as to satisfy the prescribed conditions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Good water within a convenient distance, is also an essential element in the choice of ground for a camp; without this the soldiers' health is soon undermined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>The proximity of running streams is also important for the purposes of washing and bathing, and for carrying off the filth of the camp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>The camp should not be so placed as to be enfiladed or commanded by any point within long cannon range; if bordering on a river or smaller stream, there should be space enough between them to form in order of battle ; the communications in rear should offer the means of retreating in case of necessity, but should not afford facilities to the enemy to make his attack on that side.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>If the camp is to be occupied for a considerable length of time, as for <hi rend="italics">cantonments</hi> or <hi rend="italics">winter-quarters</hi>, the greater must be the care in selecting its position and in the arrangement for the health and comfort of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>In the latter case, (of winter-quarters,) the engineer's art should always be called in play to form intrenchments, lines of abattis, inundations, &amp;c., to render the position as difficult of access to the enemy as possible.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>I. When an army awaits the attack, it takes its position and forms its line of battle according to the nature of the ground and the supposed character and strength of the enemy's forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Such is usually the case when an army wishes to cover a siege, protect a capital, guard depots of provisions and military stores, or some important strategic point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>The general relations of positions with strategy and engineering have already been considered; we will now discuss merely their relations to battles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> condition to be satisfied by a tactical position is, that its debouches shall be more favorable for falling on the enemy when he has approached to the desired point, than those which the enemy can have for attacking our line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>It is very seldom that all these conditions can be satisfied at the same time; and sometimes the very means of satisfying <num value="1">one</num>, may be in direct violation of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>A river, a forest, or a mountain, which secures a flank of a line of battle, may become an obstacle to a retreat, should the defensive forces be thrown back upon that wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>Again, the position may be difficult of attack in front or <pb id="p.116" n="116"/>on the wings, and at the same time unfavorable for retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>According to the strategic relations of the contending forces in a campaign, will it be determined whether we are to await the enemy, or to seek him out and attack him wherever he may be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>We may sometimes be obliged to make the attack at all hazards, for the purpose of preventing the junction of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName>, or to cut off forces that may be separated from the main body by a river, &amp;c. As a general rule the attacking force has a moral superiority over the defensive, but this advantage is frequently more than counterbalanced by other conditions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>The main thing in an <hi rend="italics">offensive</hi> battle is to seize upon the decisive point of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>This point is determined by the configuration of the ground, the position of the contending forces, the strategic object of the battle; or, by a combination of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>For example, when <num value="1">one</num> wing of the enemy rests on a height that commands the remainder of his line, this would seem the decisive point to be attacked, for its occupation would secure the greatest advantages; but this point may be so very difficult of access, or be so related to the strategic object as to render its attack out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Thus it was at the battle of Bautzen: the left of the allies rested on the mountains of Bohemia, which were difficult of attack, but favorable for defence; moreover, their only line of retreat was on the right, which thus became the point of attack for the <rs>French</rs>, although the topographical and tactical key of the field was on the left.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/><num value="3">III</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>It frequently happens in modern warfare that battles <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>result from the meeting of armies in motion, both parties acting on the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Indeed, an army that is occupying a defensive position may, on the approach of the enemy, advance to meet him while on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>Battles of this kind may partake of the mixed character of offensive and defensive actions, or they may be of the nature of a surprise to both armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>To this class belong the battles of Rosbach, <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7012328" n="1.000 10" reg="Lutzen,Halle,Sachsen-Anhalt,Deutschland,Europe">Lutzen</placeName>, Luzzara, <placeName key="tgn,1038106" n="1.000 10" reg="Abensberg,Niederbayern,Bayern,Deutschland,Europe">Abensberg</placeName>, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>Surprises were much more common in ancient than in modern times, for the noise of musketry and the roar of artillery, belonging to the posts or wings assailed, will prevent any general surprise of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>Moreover, the division into separate masses, or <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, will necessarily confine the surprise to a part, at most, of the forces employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Nevertheless, in the change given to military terms, a surprise may now mean only an unexpected combination of manoeuvres for an attack, rather than an actual falling upon troops unguarded or asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>We will now discuss the particular manner of arranging the troops on the line of battle, or the manner of employing each arm, without entering, however, much into the detailed tactics of formation and instruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>We shall begin with <hi rend="italics">infantry</hi>, as the most important arm on the battle-field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>There are <num value="4">four</num> different ways of forming infantry for battle: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, as tirailleurs, or light troops; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, in deployed lines; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, in lines of battalions, ployed on the central division of each battalion, or formed in squares; <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, in deep masses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>These different modes of formation are reduced to <num value="4">four</num> separate systems : <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, the thin formation of <num value="2">two</num> deployed lines; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, a line of battalions in columns of attack on the centre, or in squares by battalions ; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, a combination of these <num value="2">two</num>, or the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line deployed, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in <pb id="p.122" n="122"/>columns of attack ; and <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, the deep formation of heavy columns of several battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>The tirailleurs are merely accessories to the main forces, and are employed to fill up intervals, to protect the march of the columns, to annoy the enemy, and to manoeuvre on the flanks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>Formerly the line of battle for infantry was very generally that of <num value="2">two</num> deployed lines of troops, as shown in Fig. <num value="26">26</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>But reason and experience have demonstrated that infantry in this thin or light order can only move very slowly; that in attempting rapid movements it breaks and exhibits great and dangerous undulations, and would be easily pierced through by troops of a deeper order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>Hence it is that the light formation is only proper when the infantry is to make use of its fire, and to remain almost stationary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>If the formation of a line of battalions in columns of attack be employed, the depth and mobility will depend upon the organization or habitual formation of this arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>In our service a battalion is supposed to be composed of <num value="10">ten</num> companies, each formed in <num value="3">three</num> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>The <num value="2">two</num> flank companies are designed for tirailleurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>This would give a. column of <num value="4">four</num> divisions, and consequently <num value="12">twelve</num> files deep; and as only <num value="2">two</num> of these files could employ their fire, there would be much too large a portion of noncombatants exposed to the enemy's artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>In practice, however, we employ the <num value="2">two</num>-rank formation, which, if the flank companies be detached, would give a column of attack <num value="8">eight</num> files in depth, which is not objectionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>If, however, the flank companies should be present in the battalion, the depth of the column would still be <num value="10">ten</num> files.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>In the <rs>French</rs> service, each battalion is composed of <num value="4">four</num> divisions, formed in either <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>The <num value="2">two</num>-rank formation is the <num value="1">one</num> habitually employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>If all the companies be present, and the formation in <num value="3">three</num> ranks, the depth of column will be <num value="12">twelve</num> files ; if in <num value="2">two</num> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>But the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> rank is employed as tirailleurs, which gives a depth of column of <num value="8">eight</num> files.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>The employment of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> rank for tirailleurs is deemed objectionable on account of the difficulty of rallying them on the column.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>The formation of squares is exceedingly effective in an open country, and against an enemy who is superior in cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>Formerly very large squares were employed, but they are now formed either by regiment or by battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>Troops in motion can make but little use of their firearms, whatever may be their formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>If in very large masses, they move slower and are more exposed; but the moral effect of these large moveable columns is such, that they frequently carry positions without ever employing their fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>The <name>French</name> columns usually succeeded against the <name>Austrian</name> and Prussian infantry, but the <rs>English</rs> infantry could not so easily be driven from their ground; they also employed their fire to greater advantage, as was shown at <placeName reg="Talavera de la Reina, Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha" key="tgn,7008710">Talavera</placeName>, Busaco, <persName n="Honore,,Fuente,,,de" id="n0053.0006.00124.00327" reg="expanded:Honore,Fuente,,,"><foreName>Fuente</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Honore</surname></persName>, <placeName key="tgn,1083934" n="1.000 10" reg="Albuera,Leyte,Pilipinas,Asia">Albuera</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Waterloo, Brabant, Wallonie" key="tgn,7008022">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>The smaller columns and the mixed formation were always most successful against such troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/><pb id="p.125" n="125"/></p> 
<p>From these remarks we must conclude--<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, That the very thin as well as the very deep formation is objectionable under ordinary circumstances, and can seldom be employed with safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>That the attack by battalions in columns by division is the best for carrying a position; the column should, however, be diminished in depth as much as possible, in order both to increase its own fire and to diminish its exposure to the fire of the enemy ; moreover, it should be well covered by tirailleurs and supported by cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>That the mixed formation of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line deployed and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in columns of battalion by division is the best for defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>That either of the last <num value="2">two</num> may be employed in the offensive or defensive, according to the nature of the ground, the character of the general, and the character and position of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>Squares are always good against cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>Troops should be habituated to all these formations, and accustomed to pass rapidly from <num value="1">one</num> to another in the daytime or at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>None, however, but disciplined troops can do this: hence the great superiority of regulars on the field of battle, where skilful manoeuvres frequently effect more than the most undaunted courage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>The arm next in importance on the battle-field is <hi rend="italics">cavalry</hi>. The principal merit of this arm consists in its <hi rend="italics">velocity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">mobility</hi>. Cavalry has little solidity, and cannot of itself defend any position against infantry; but in connection with the other arms, it is indispensable for beginning a battle, for completing a victory, and for reaping its full advantage by pursuing and destroying the beaten foe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>There are <num value="4">four</num> different modes of forming cavalry, the same as for infantry: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, in deployed lines; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, a line of regiments in column of attack on the centre; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, the <pb id="p.126" n="126"/>mixed formation; and <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, the deep formation of several columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>The thin formation was deemed objectionable for infantry, on account of its liability to be penetrated by cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>The same objection does not hold so forcibly with respect to this latter arm; but full lines are deemed less advantageous than lines deployed checker-wise or in echelon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>In either case the distance between the lines should be sufficient to prevent the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line from coming in contact with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, in case the latter receives a slight check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>This distance need not be so great in lines deployed checker-wise, as when they are full, or in echelon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> system of formation, that is, a line of columns of attack on the central division for infantry, is by battalion, but for cavalry, by regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>If the regiment is composed of <num value="8">eight</num> squadrons, the column will contain <num value="4">four</num> lines, <num value="2">two</num> squadrons forming a division; but if composed of only <num value="6">six</num> squadrons, the column will contain only <num value="3">three</num> lines, and consequently will be <num value="6">six</num> files in depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>In either case the distance between the lines should be that of a demi-squadron, when the troops are drawn up in battle array; but when charging, the divisions may close to a less distance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>In forming a grand division of <num value="2">two</num> brigades, by the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> or mixed system, <num value="2">two</num> regiments may be deployed in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, and <num value="3">three</num> formed in columns of attack in rear of the flanks and centre, as is shown in Fig. <num value="33">33</num>, the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> being held in reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>This formation is deemed a good <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> system, of deep columns of cavalry, is entirely unsuited for the charge, and this formation can only be employed for troops drawn up in reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>The flanks of lines or columns of cavalry are always much exposed, and squadrons should therefore be formed <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>in echelon on the right and left, and a little in rear of the main body, in order to protect the flanks from the attacks of the enemy's horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>Irregular cavalry is usually employed for this purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>In the formation of a grand division in line of battle, care should be taken not to give too great an extent to the command of the generals of brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>If the formation be in <num value="2">two</num> lines, neither brigade should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>form an entire line but each should form a wing of the division, <num value="2">two</num> regiments of the same brigade being placed in rear of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>This rule is an important <num value="1">one</num>, and should never be neglected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>It may also be laid down as a maxim, in the formation of cavalry on the battle-field, that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line after the charge, even if most successful, may require reforming in rear of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, and that this last should be prepared to act in the front line after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> onset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>The success of the battle frequently depends upon the charge of the final reserve of cavalry on the flanks of lines already engaged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>It is on account of this frequent manoeuvring of the cavalry on the battle-field, its reforming for repeated charges, that great bodies deployed in full lines are principally objected to. They cannot be handled with the facility and rapidity of columns of regiments by divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>The attack of <orgName n="Nansouty's Cav"><persName n="Nansouty,Cav,,,," id="n0053.0006.00127.00328" reg="mostcommon:Nansouty,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Cav"></roleName><surname>Nansouty</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="cavalry">cavalry</orgName></orgName>, formed in this way, on the <name>Prussian</name> cavalry, deployed it advance of Chateaou-<persName n="Thierry,,,,," id="n0053.0006.00127.00329" reg="mostcommon:Thierry,nomatch:0"><surname>Thierry</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, is a good proof of this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>Cavalry may be brought to a charge--<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, in columns; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, in line ; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, in route, or at random, (<hi rend="italics">&agrave; la debandade</hi>.) These may also be varied by charging either at a trot or a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>All these modes have been employed with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>In a regular charge in line the lance offers great advantages; in the melee the sabre is the best weapon; hence some military writers have proposed arming <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>the front rank with lances, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> with sabres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>The pistol and the carabine are useless in the charge, but may sometimes be employed with advantage against convoys, outposts, and light cavalry; to fire the carabine with any effect, the troop must be at a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>In all charges in line, especially against cavalry, the fast trot is deemed preferable to the gallop, on account of the difficulty of keeping up the alignment when the speed is increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>Lances are utterly useless in a melee, and in employing troops armed in this way, it is of the greatest importance to keep then in order and in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>In charging with the sabre against artillery the gallop may sometimes be employed, for velocity here may be more important than force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>We will now consider the formation and use of <hi rend="italics">artillery</hi> on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>It may be laid down as a fundamental principle, that the fire of artillery should be directed on that part of the enemy's line which we design to pierce; for this fire will not only weaken this point, but will also aid the attack of the cavalry and infantry when the principal efforts are directed towards the intended point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>In the defence,the artillery is usually distributed throughout the whole line, on ground favorable for its fire; but the reserve should be so placed that it can easily be brought to bear on the point where the enemy will be most likely to direct his principal attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>Artillery placed on a plain, or with ground slightly inclined in front, and using the point-blank or ricochet fire, is the most effective; very high points are unfavorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>If possible, the concentric fire should be employed against the ememy's columns of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>The position of the <orgName n="English Artillery" type="artillery">English artillery</orgName> on the field of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Brabant, Wallonie" key="tgn,7008022">Waterloo</placeName>, and the use of the concentric fire, furnishes <num value="1">one</num> of the best examples for the disposition of this arm to be found in moderm military history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/><pb id="p.129" n="129"/></p> 
<p>The proper use of artillery on the battle-field is against the enemy's infantry and cavalry, consequently only a small part of it should be employed to respond to the fire of the enemy's batteries ; not more than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> at most can be spared for this object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>If possible, batteries should be established so as to take the enemy's line in flank, either by an oblique or enfilading fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>A direct fire against columns of attack, with a few light pieces thrown out to take it in flank at the same time, will always be advantageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>A direct and flank fire was employed with success by Kleist against the column of <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0053.0006.00129.00330" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName> at the battle of Bautzen; the <rs>French</rs> marshal was forced to change his direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>Batteries should always be well secured on the flanks, and constantly sustained by infantry or cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>If attacked by cavalry, the artillery should keep up its fire as long as possible, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with ball, and then with grape when the enemy arrives within a suitable distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>The same rule will apply to attacks of infantry, except that the fire of solid shot at a great distance is much less effective than against mounted troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>The <hi rend="italics">engineer troops</hi> are employed on the field of battle principally by detachments, acting as auxiliaries to the other arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Each regiment of infantry should have a detachment of sappers armed with axes to act as pioneers, for the removal of obstacles that may impede its advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>These sappers are of the utmost importance, for without them an entire column might be checked and thrown into confusion by impediments which a few sappers with their axes would remove in a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>Detachments of engineer troops must also act in concert with the cavalry and artillery for the same purpose as above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>In establishing the batteries of artillery, in opening roads for their manoeuvres, and in arranging material obstacles for their defence, the axes, picks, and shovels of the sappers are of <pb id="p.130" n="130"/>infinite value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>Field-works, bridges, and bridge-defences, frequently have a decisive influence upon the result of a battle, but as these are usually arranged previous to the action, they will be discussed in another place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>In the attack and defence of these field-works, the engineer troops play a distinguished part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>The consideration of this part of the subject, though perhaps properly belonging to the tactics of battles, will also be postponed to another occasion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>We will now discuss the employment of the combined arms on the field of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>Before the <rs>French Revolution</rs>, all the infantry, formed by regiments and brigades, was united in a single body and drawn up in <num value="2">two</num> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>The cavalry was placed on the <num value="2">two</num> flanks, and the artillery distributed along the entire line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>In moving by wings, they formed <num value="4">four</num> columns, <num value="2">two</num> of cavalry and <num value="2">two</num> of infantry: in moving by a flank, they formed only <num value="2">two</num> very long columns; the cavalry, however, sometimes formed <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> and column in flank movements, but this disposition was rarely made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>The French Revolution introduced the system of grand divisions composed of the <num value="4">four</num> arms combined; each division moved separately and independently of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>In the wars of the <rs>Empire</rs>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0006.00130.00331" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Histoire,,,de"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> united <num value="2">two</num> or more of these divisions into a <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, which formed a wing, the centre, or reserve of his grand army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>In addition to these divisions and <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, he had large reserves of cavalry and artillery, which were employed as distinct and separate arms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>If the forces be sufficiently numerous to fight by <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, each corps should have its own reserve, independent of the general reserve of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>Again, if the forces be so small as to act by grand divisions only, each division should then have <hi rend="italics">its</hi> separate reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>An army, whether composed of separate corps or of <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>grand divisions, usually forms, on the field of battle, a centre, <num value="2">two</num> wings, and a reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>Each corps or division acts by itself; with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>its infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineer troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>The reserve of cavalry may be formed in rear of the centre or <num value="1">one</num> of the wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>In small forces of <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> men, the cavalry may act with advantage on the wings, in the manner of the ancients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>If the reserve of this arm be large enough to form <num value="3">three</num> separate bodies, it may <hi rend="italics">itself</hi> very properly be formed into a centre and wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>If it be formed into <num value="2">two</num> columns only, they may be placed in rear of the openings between the centre and the wings of the main force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>The reserve of artillery is employed either to reinforce the centre or a wing, and in the defensive is frequently distributed throughout the whole line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>In offensive operations, it may be well to concentrate as much fire as possible on the intended point of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>The mounted artillery either acts in concert with the cavalry, or is used to reinforce that arm; the light-foot acts with the infantry and the batteries of heavy calibre are distributed along the line, or concentrated on some important point where their fire may be most (effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>They reach the enemy's forces at a distance, and arrest the impulsion of his attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>They may also be employed to draw the fire of his artillery; but their movements are too slow and difficult for a reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>The order of succession in which the different arms are engaged in a battle, depends upon the nature of the ground and other accidental circumstances, and cannot be determined by any fixed rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>The following, however, is most frequently employed, and in ordinary cases may be deemed good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>The attack is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opened by a cannonade; light troops are sent forward to annoy the enemy, and, if possible, to pick off his artillerists, The main body then advances in <pb id="p.132" n="132"/><num value="2">two</num> lines: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> displays itself in line as it arrives nearly within the range of grape-shot; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line remains in columns of attack formed of battalions by division, at a distance from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sufficient to be beyond the reach of the enemy's musketry, but near enough to support the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, or to cover it, if driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>The artillery, in the mean time, concentrates its fire on some weak point to open a way for the reserve, which rushes into the opening and takes the enemy in flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>The cavalry charges at the opportune moment on the flank of the enemy's columns or penetrates an opening in his line, and cutting to pieces his staggered troops, forces them into retreat, and completes the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>During this time the whole line of the enemy should be kept occupied, so as to prevent fresh troops from being concentrated on the threatened point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>The following maxims on battles may be studied with advantage :--<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>. <hi rend="italics">General battles</hi> are not to be fought but under the occurrence of <num value="1">one</num> of the following circumstances: when you are, from any cause, decidedly superior to the enemy; when he is on the point of receiving reinforcements, which will materially effect your relative strength; when, if not beaten or checked, he will deprive you of supplies or reinforcements, necessary to the continuance or success of your operations; and, generally, when the advantage of winning the battle will be greater than the disadvantage of losing it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>Whatever may be your reason for risking a general battle, you ought to regard as indispensable preliminaries,---a thorough knowledge of the ground on which you are to act; an ample supply of ammunition; the most perfect order in your fire-arms; hospital depots regularly established, with surgeons, nurses, dressings, &amp;c., sufficient for the accommodation of the wounded; points of rendezvous established and known to the commanders of <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>corps; and an entire possession of the passes in your own rear.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>The battle being fought and <hi rend="italics">won</hi>, the victory must be followed up with as much alacrity and vigor, as though nothing had been gained,--a maxim very difficult of observance, (from the momentary disobedience which pervades all troops flushed with conquest,) but with which an able general will never dispense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>It is scarcely necessary to remark that, to effect this object,--to reinspire a beaten army with hope, and to reassure it of victory,--we must not turn our backs on an enemy, without sometimes presenting to him our front also ;--we must not confide our safety to mere flight, but adopt such measures as shall convince him that though wounded and overpowered, we are neither disabled nor dismayed; and that we still possess enough both of strength and spirit to punish his faults, should he commit any. Do you operate in a covered or mountainous country?--avail yourself of its ridges and woods; for by doing so you will best evade the pressure of his cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/>Have you defiles or villages to pass?--seize the heads of these, defend them obstinately, and make a show of fighting another battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>In a word, let no error of your enemy, nor any favorable incident of the ground, escape your notice or your use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>There is also a vast difference in the cost of supporting regulars and militia forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>The cost of a regular army of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men for a campaign of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, in this country, has been estimated, from data in the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War-office</orgName>, at a <measure n="150dollars" type="currency">hundred and fifty dollars</measure> per man; while the cost of a militia force, under the same circumstances, making allowance for the difference in the expenses from sickness, waste of camp-furniture, equipments, &amp;c., will be <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">two hundred and fifty dollars</measure> per man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>Of themselves they can never exert an influence corrupting to public morals, or dangerous to public liberty; but as the means of preserving peace, and as obstacles to an invader, their influence and power are immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>While contributing to the economical support of a peace establishment, by furnishing drill-grounds, parades, quarters, &amp;c.; and to its efficiency still more, by affording facilities both to the regulars and militia for that species of artillery practice so necessary in the defence of water frontiers; they also serve as safe depots of arms and the immense quantity of materials and military munitions so indispensable in modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>These munitions usually require much time, skill, and expense in their construction, and it is of vast importance <pb id="p.152" n="152"/>that they should be preserved with the utmost care.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>Maritime arsenals and depots of naval and military stores on the sea-coast are more particularly exposed to capture and destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>Here an enemy can approach by stealth, striking some sudden and fatal blow before any effectual resistance can be organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>But in addition to the security afforded by harbor fortifications to public property of the highest military value, they also serve to protect the merchant shipping, and the vast amount of private wealth which a commercial people always collect at these points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>They furnish safe retreats, and the means of repair for public vessels injured in battle, or by storms, and to merchantmen a refuge from the dangers of sea, or the threats of hostile fleets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Moreover, they greatly facilitate our naval attacks upon the enemy's shipping; and if he attempt a descent, their well-directed fire will repel his squadrons from our harbors, and force his troops to land at some distant and unfavorable position.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>The channel at the mouth of the river was too broad to be defended by the works of <placeName reg="Flushing, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015854">Flushing</placeName>, and the main portion of the fleet passed out of reach of the guns, and ascended the <name>Scheldt</name> part way up to <persName n="Antwerp,,,,," id="n0053.0008.00161.00379" reg="mostcommon:Antwerp,nomatch:0"><surname>Antwerp</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>The cost of the expedition was immense, both in treasure and in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>It was certainly very poorly managed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>But we cannot help noticing the superior value of fortifications as a defence against such descents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>They did much to retard the operations of the enemy till a defensive army could be raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>The works of <placeName reg="Flushing, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015854">Flushing</placeName> were never intended to close up the <name>Scheldt</name>, and of course could not intercept the passage of shipping; but they were not reduced by the <rs>English</rs> naval force, as has sometimes been alleged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>Yet what was the effect produced on the defences of the place by this lire, so formidable, to judge by the sound alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>The writer can answer the question with some accuracy, for he went along the entire sea-line the very day after the capitulation, and found no part of the parapet injured so as to be of the slightest consequence, and only <num value="1">one</num> solitary gun dismounted, evidently by the bursting of a shell, and which could not, of course, have been thrown from the line of battle ships, but must have been thrown from the land batteries.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/><note anchored="yes"> 
<p>The batteries constructed in the siege of this place were armed with <num value="52">fifty-two</num> heavy guns and mortars.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>But it may be said that although great naval descents on a hostile coast are almost always unsuccessful, never-theless a direct naval attack upon a single fortified position will be attended with more favorable results; and that our seaport towns, however fortified, will be exposed to bombardment and destruction by the enemy's fleets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>In other words, that in a direct contest between ships and forts the former will have at least an equal chance of success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>Let us suppose a fair trial of this relative strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>The fort is to be properly constructed and in good repair; its guns in a position to be used with effect; its garrison skilful and efficient; its commander capable and brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>The ship is of the very best character, and in perfect order; the crew disciplined and courageous; its commander skilful and adroit; the wind, and tide, and sea &mdash; all as could be desired.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/> 
<p>These conditions for a battery are easily satisfied, but for the ship, are partly dependent on the elements, and seldom to be wholly attained.</p></note> The numbers of the garrison and crew are to be no more than requisite, with no unnecessary exposure of human life to swell the lists of the slain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>The issue of this contest, unless attended with <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>extraordinary and easily distinguishable circumstances, would be a fair test of their relative strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>What result should we anticipate from the nature of the contending forces?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>The ship, under the circumstances we have supposed, can choose her point of attack, selecting the <num value="1">one</num> she may deem the most vulnerable; but she herself is everywhere vulnerable; her men and guns are much concentrated, and consequently much exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>But in the fort the guns and men are more distributed, a fort with an interior area of several acres not having a garrison as large as the crew of a <num value="74">seventy-four</num>-gun ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>All parts of the vessel are liable to injury; while the fort offers but a small mark,--the opening of the embrasures, a small part of the carriage, and now and then a head or arm raised above the parapet,--the ratio of exposed surfaces being not less than <hi rend="italics"><num value="20">twenty</num></hi> to <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi>. In the vessel the guns are fired from an oscillating deck, and the balls go at random; in the fort the guns are fired from an immoveable platform, and the balls reach their object with unerring aim. There is always more or less motion in the water, so that the ship's gun, though accurately pointed at <num value="1">one</num> moment, at the next will be thrown entirely away from the object, even when the motion is too slight to be otherwise noticed; whereas in the battery the guns will be fired just as they are pointed; and the motion of the vessel will merely vary to the extent of a few inches the spot in which the shot is received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>In the fort the men and guns are behind impenetrable walls of stone and earth; in the vessel they are behind frail bulwarks, whose splinters are equally destructive with the shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>The fort is incombustible; while the ship may readily be set on fire by incendiary projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>The ship has many points exposed that may be called vital points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>By losing her rudder, or portions of her rigging, or of her spars, she may become unmanageable, and unable to use <pb id="p.164" n="164"/>her strength; she may receive shots under water, and be liable to sink; she may receive hot shot, and be set on fire: these damages are in addition to those of having her guns dismounted and her people killed by shots that pierce her sides and scatter splinters from her timbers; while the risks of the battery are confined to those mentioned above &mdash; namely, the risk that the gun, the carriage, or the men may be struck.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>The opinions of military writers, and the facts of history, fully accord with these deductions of theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>Some few individuals mistaking, or misstating, the facts of a few recent trials, assert that modern improvements in the naval service have so far outstripped the progress in the art of land defence, that a floating force is now abundantly able to cope, upon equal terms, with a land battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>Ignorant and superficial persons, hearing merely that certain forts had recently yielded to a naval force, and taking no trouble to learn the real facts of the case, have paraded them before the public as proofs positive of a new era in military science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>This conclusion, however groundless and absurd, has received credit merely from its novelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>Let us examine the several trials of strength which have taken place between ships and forts within the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, and see what have been the results.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>The motives of the retreat cannot, therefore, be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>Had the <name>Arabs</name> set themselves zealously at work, during the night, to prepare for a new contest, by remounting their guns, and placing others behind the ruins of those batteries which had fallen,--in other words, had the works now been placed in hands as skilful and experienced as the <rs>English</rs>, the contest would have been far from ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>But (to use the words of the <name>Board</name> of Defence) <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Exmouth</foreName></persName> relied on the effects produced on <pb id="p.188" n="188"/>the people by his dreadful cannonade; and the result proves that he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>His anxiety to clear the vessels from the contest shows that there was a power still unconquered, which he thought it better to leave to be restrained by the suffering population of the city, than to keep in a state of exasperation and activity by his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>What was this power but an unsubdued energy in the batteries?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>The true solution of the question is, then, not so much the amount of injury done on the <num value="1">one</num> side or the other &mdash; particularly as there was on <num value="1">one</num> side a city to suffer as well as the batteries &mdash; as the relative efficiency of the parties when the battle closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>These are questions that can be answered only on conjecture; but the manner the battle ended certainly leaves room for many doubts whether, had the subsequent demands of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Exmouth</foreName></persName> been rejected, he had it in his power to enforce them by his ships; whether, indeed, if he had renewed the fight, he would not have been signally defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>On the whole, we do not think that this battle, although it stands preeminent as an example of naval success over batteries, presents an argument to shake the confidence which fortifications, well situated, well planned, and well fought, deserve, as the defences of a seaboard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>We cannot help regarding these conclusions as just, when we reflect upon all the circumstances of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>The high character, skill, and bravery of the attacking force; their immense superiority in number of guns, with no surplus human life to be exposed; the antiquated and ill-managed works of defence, the entire want of skill of the <rs>Algerine</rs> artillerists, and the neglect of the ordinary means of preparation; the severe execution which these <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>ill-served guns did upon the enemy's ships,--an execution far more dreadful than that effected by the <rs>French</rs> or <rs>Dutch</rs> fleets in their best-contested naval battles with the ships of the same foe,--from these facts, we must think that those who are so ready to draw from this case conclusions unfavorable to the use of land-batteries as a means of defence against shipping, know but little of the nature of the contest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>He had no recollection, in all his experience, except the recent instance on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>, of any fort being taken by ships, excepting <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, when the fort of <placeName key="tgn,7005859" n="1.000 9" reg="san juan,san juan,puerto rico,north and central america">San Juan</placeName> d'ulloa was captured by the <orgName n="French fleet" type="fleet">French fleet</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>The present achievement he considered <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>This was his opinion, and he gave the highest credit to those who had performed such a service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>It was, altogether, a most skilful proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>He was greatly surprised at the small number of men that was lost on board the fleet; and, on inquiring how it happened, he discovered that it was because the vessels were moored within <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the ordinary distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>The guns of the fortress were intended to strike objects at a greater distance ; and the consequence <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>was, that the shot went over the ships that were anchored at <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> the usual distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>By that means, they sustained not more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the loss which they would otherwise have experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Not less than <num value="500">five hundred</num> pieces of ordnance were directed against the walls, and the precision with which the fire was kept up, the position of the vessels, and, lastly, the blowing up of the large magazine &mdash; all aided in achieving this great victory in so short a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>He had thought it right to say thus much, because he wished to warn the public against supposing that such deeds as this could be effected every day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>Having completed our examination of the ability of land batteries to cope, gun for gun, with a naval force, let us consider, for a few moments, the objection which is sometimes made to the use of fortifications for the defence of the sea-coast, viz.: <hi rend="italics">that our maritime cities and arsenals can be better and more economically secured by a <orgName n="Home Squadron" type="squadron">home squadron</orgName></hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>We have already alluded to the impossibility of substituting <num value="1">one</num> means of defence for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>The efficiency of the bayonet can in no way enable us to dispense with artillery, nor the value of engineer troops in the passage of rivers, and the attack and defence of forts, render cavalry the less necessary in other operations of a campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>To the navy alone must we look for the defence of our shipping upon the high seas; but it cannot replace fortifications in the protection of our harbors, bays, rivers, arsenals, and. commercial towns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Let us take a case in point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>For the defence of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName>, it is deemed highly important that the <rs>East</rs> <pb id="p.195" n="195"/>River should be closed to the approach of a hostile fleet at least <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> from the city, so that an army landed there would have to cross the <rs type="place">Westchester creek</rs>, the <rs>Bronx</rs>, <placeName reg="Harlem River, New York, United States" key="tgn,2377052">Harlem river</placeName>, and the defiles of <placeName reg="Harlem Heights, Fayette, West Virginia" key="tgn,2377049">Harlem heights</placeName> &mdash; obstacles of great importance in a judicious defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Throg's Neck is the position selected for this purpose; cannon placed there not only command the channel, but, from the windings of the river, sweep it for a great distance above and below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>No other position, even <hi rend="italics">in</hi> the channel itself, possesses equal advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Hence, if we had only naval means of defence, it would be best, were such a thing possible, to place the floating defences themselves on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Leaving entirely out of consideration the question of relative <hi rend="italics">power, position</hi> alone would give the superior efficiency to the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>But there are other considerations no less important than that of position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/><placeName reg="Fort Schuyler">Fort Schuyler</placeName> can be garrisoned and defended in part by the same militia force which will be employed to prevent the march of the enemy's army on the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>On the other hand, the crews of the floating defences must be seamen; they will consequently be of less value in the subsequent land operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Moreover, forts, situated as this is, can be so planned as to bring to bear upon any part of the channel a greater number of guns than can be presented by any hostile squadron against the corresponding portion of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>This result can be obtained with little difficulty in narrow channels, as is done in most of the other works for the defence of New York, the works for <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Newport, Rhode Island, Newport" key="tgn,7014221">Newport</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, New Orleans, &amp;c., and an approximation to it is not incompatible with the defence of the broader estuaries, like the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>But we will suppose that there are no such points of land, in the inlets to our harbors, and that we rely for defence upon a naval force exclusively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>Let us leave out of <pb id="p.196" n="196"/>consideration the security of all our other harbors and our commerce on the high seas, and also the importance of having at command the means of attacking the enemy's coast, in the absence of his fleet.

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="8" n="VIII"><num value="8">8</num></num>: our northern frontier defences.&mdash;Brief description of the fortifications on the frontier, and an analysis of our northern campaigns.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>In discussing engineering as a branch of the military art, we spoke of the use of fortifications on land frontiers, and their influence on the strategic operations of a campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>A brief notice was also given of the different systems that have been proposed for arranging these defensive works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>Let us now apply this discussion to our northern frontier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>The principle laid down by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0009.00210.00450" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Memoires,,,:2"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n0053.0009.00210.00451" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>, <quote>that fortifications should always be constructed on important strategic points,</quote> is undoubtedly the correct <num value="1">one</num>: but how to determine these points is a question that will often perplex the patience and try the skill of the engineer; yet determine them he must, or his fortifications will be worse than useless; for a fort improperly located, like a cannon with its fire reversed on its own artillerists, will be sure to effect the destruction of the very forces it was designed to protect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>The selection of positions for fortifications on our northern frontier must have reference to <num value="3">three</num> distinct classes of objects, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>.: the security, <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi>, of the large frontier towns, where much public and private property is exposed to sudden dashing expeditions of the foe, made either on land or by water; <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num></hi>, of lake harbors, important as places of refuge and security to our own ships, or to the enemy's fleets while engaged in landing troops or furnishing supplies to an invading army; <hi rend="italics"><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></hi>, of all strategic points on the probable lines of offensive or defensive <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>These objects are distinct in their nature, and would seem to require separate and distinct means for their accomplishment; nevertheless, it will generally be found that positions selected with reference to <num value="1">one</num> of these objects equally fulfil the others, so intimately are they all connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>To determine the strategic points of a probable line of military operations is therefore the main thing to be attended to in locating fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>That such points of maximum importance are actually marked out by the peaceful or hostile intercourse of nations cannot be doubted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>The <hi rend="italics">relative</hi> importance of cities and towns is less varied by the fluctuations of commerce on a land frontier than on the sea-coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>The ever-changing system of <quote>internal improvements,</quote> by furnishing new highways and thoroughfares for the transportation of the products of manufacturers and agriculture, either continually varies the relative standing of the seaports already opened, or opens new ones for the exportation of these products, and the importation of foreign articles received in exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>But these <quote>internal improvements</quote> are seldom carried so far as to connect together <num value="2">two</num> separate and distinct countries, and consequently the principal places on the dividing line usually retain their relative importance, no matter how often they may have declined during times of hostility, or again flourished with the increased commercial intercourse which results from peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>The principal <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> places of traffic near the frontiers have remained the same for ages, and in all probability ages hence the great frontier marts will be nearly the same as at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>This stability of rank among border towns is not confined to commercial influence; the same holds true with respect to that established by intercourse of a hostile character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>Military history teaches us that lines of hostile operations, and the fields upon which the principal battles <pb id="p.212" n="212"/>between any <num value="2">two</num> countries have been fought, are nearly the same, no matter how remote the periods of comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2067"/>These points and lines, so important in commerce as well as in war, result from the natural features of the ground, and we ought therefore to expect that they would be as little liable to sudden changes as the character of the earth itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2068"/>From these remarks it will readily be perceived that there are <num value="3">three</num> distinct methods of determining the strategic points between this country and <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, by an examination of the topography of the <num value="2">two</num> countries; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, by tracing out the main channels of commercial intercourse; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, by reviewing the lines of their military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2069"/>The last method is the least liable to error, and perhaps is the most easily understood, inasmuch as it is sometimes difficult to point out the precise degree of connection between prospective military lines and the channels of commerce, or to show why these <num value="2">two</num> have a fixed relation to the physical features of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>In the present instance, moreover, this method furnishes ample data for the formation of our decision, inasmuch as the campaigns between this country and <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> have been neither few in number nor unimportant in their character and results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>In tracing out the main features of the early wars upon our northern frontier, it must be borne in mind that nearly the same portion of country which is now possessed by the <rs>English</rs>, was then occupied by the <rs>French</rs>, and that the <rs>English</rs> possessions in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> included the present Middle and Northern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>At the period of the <rs>American</rs> revolution the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>English</rs> had completely changed ground, the armies of the former operating in the <quote>States,</quote> while the <rs>English</rs> were in possession of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>We see that, thus far in these wars, the <rs>English</rs> were vastly superior in strength and numbers, yet the result of the several campaigns was decidedly in favor of the <rs>French</rs>, who not only retained their possessions in the <rs>North</rs>, but extended their jurisdiction to the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, and laid claim to the whole country west of the <rs type="place">Alleghany mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>This success must be attributed, not to any superiority of the <name>Canadians</name> in bravery, <pb id="p.216" n="216"/>but to the higher military character of their governors, <hi rend="italics">and more especially to their fortifications</hi>, which were constructed in situations most judiciously selected, to influence the <name>Indians</name> and facilitate incursions into the <rs>English</rs> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>The <rs>French</rs> pursued interior and central lines, while the <rs>English</rs> followed exterior and divergent lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>It may, and probably will ere long, be made to surrender to our arms; but it would be utter folly to base our military operations on the contingency of a short and successful siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>By advancing upon <placeName reg="Montreal, Ile de Montreal, Quebec" key="tgn,7013051">Montreal</placeName> by the <rs type="place">Lake Champlain</rs> route, we could cut off the <rs>Canadian</rs> forces in the <pb id="p.229" n="229"/>West from all reinforcements; and then, as circumstances might direct, could besiege <placeName reg="Quebec" key="tgn,7005804">Quebec</placeName>, or attack the enemy in the field, or perhaps, manoeuvring as the <rs>French</rs> did at the siege of <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, accomplish both objects at the same time.</p>

<p>The successive improvements in artillery have for a long time constituted a prominent feature in war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>The ground should also be smooth, for if rough the balls will either bury themselves in the earth, or ricochet at a high angle of deflection, thus destroying a considerable part of the effect of the tire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>The counterforts or spurs of hills are favorable for artillery, as they enable it to see, with an enfilading fire, the slopes of the principal range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>Batteries should seldom be placed so as to fire over other troops, for they will not only be intimidated by this fire, but also exposed to the opposing fire of the enemy's artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>The most favorable position for this arm in ordinary ground, is in the intervals between the regiments or brigades of the line, and far enough in advance of this line not to draw upon the other troops the fire of the enemy's artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>The flanks of the line are also favorable for the action of this arm.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>Whenever this disposition has been made, it has resulted from the defective character of the other arms, or from some peculiar circumstance in the battle which enabled a bold and skilful commander to deviate from the ordinary rules of <pb id="p.295" n="295"/>tactics.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>Engineers.---The term <hi rend="italics">engineer</hi> is derived from the unclassical Latin word <hi rend="italics">ingenium</hi>, which was applied both to a <hi rend="italics">machine</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">mind</hi> or <hi rend="italics">skill</hi> of the person who devised or constructed it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>It was <persName n="Augustus,,Philip,,," id="n0053.0013.00300.00726" reg="default:Augustus,Philip,,,"><foreName>Philip</foreName> <surname>Augustus</surname></persName>, say the <rs>French</rs> writers,--who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduced engineers (<hi rend="italics">engigneurs</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">engignours</hi>, as they were called) into <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 15" reg="france">France</placeName>, and restored the art of sieges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>The engineers of that age were seldom charged with the construction of works of military defence, but, like <persName n="Archimedes,,,,," id="n0053.0013.00300.00727" reg="mostcommon:Archimedes,nomatch:0"><surname>Archimedes</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Syracuse, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,7014561">Syracuse</placeName>, and <persName n="Longinus,,,,," id="n0053.0013.00300.00728" reg="mostcommon:Longinus,nomatch:0"><surname>Longinus</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Palmyra, Wayne, New York" key="tgn,2071548">Palmyra</placeName>, they directed their attention principally to devising implements of war and the most effective manner of using them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>Engines of war were at that time divided between the <hi rend="italics">engigneurs</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">artilliers</hi>, the former being charged with the heavier machines, and the latter with the smaller weapons used for throwing projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>After the invention of gunpowder, the old battering-rams, cranes, helipoles, &amp;c., disappeared, and with them the <hi rend="italics">engigneurs</hi>, or masters of engines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>The new inventions were united with the few old projectile machines that remained in the artillery, and the engineers were for a time left almost without employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>The revival of the art of fortification was very slow, and the modern system scarcely began to be developed till near the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> century.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>We must omit for the present giving even an outline of <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>the history of military engineering, and pass to the troops of this arm, as constituting an essential element of an army organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>The subject of fortification, and the history of its various changes, will be examined in the next chapter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>The engineers, in modern army organization, constitute the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> arm of service, as, compared with artillery, their relative numbers are about as <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>They are divided in the same manner as the artillery, viz. :--<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, the staff; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, guards, or fort-keepers; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, artificers; and <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, the troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>I. The officers constituting the staff of this corps are charged in time of peace with planning, constructing, and repairing all fortifications and other defensive works; the construction and preparation of all military materials, and stores connected with this arm; and (in our service) with the disbursements of money connected with these operations: in time of war they are charged with the attack and defence of military works, the laying out and construction of field defences, redoubts, intrenchments, roads, &amp;c.; in the attack they form a part of the vanguard, to remove obstructions ; and in retreat they form a part of the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName>, to erect obstacles, destroy roads, bridges, &amp;c., so as to retard an enemy's pursuit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>From the important character of these duties as connected with the means essential to a national defence, and the vast amount of money expended in these operations, it is evident that a high order of acquirements should be deemed necessary to qualify <num value="1">one</num> to perform the duties of a military engineer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>This officer requires a knowledge of chemistry, to guide his choice of materials for mortars, cements, and. mastics; of mineralogy and geology, for selecting stone; of botany, for timber and the means of preventing its decay; of mathematics, in laying out his work and calculating the thickness and stability of his <pb id="p.302" n="302"/>walls, embankments, &amp;c.; of mechanical philosophy, in constructing his machinery; of military engineering, in his plans of fortifications; and of all the higher branches of military science, in selecting positions for these works, such that they shall have the proper relations to the means of national defence, and to the grand operations of armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>The avenues to appointment to this corps are guarded, in most <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> armies, with special care, to prevent the influence of money, politics, or family connections ; and in our own army it is now specified by law of Congress, that the vacancies shall be filled only from the most distinguished graduates of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>Formerly our service suffered most severely from the employment of incompetent persons, introduced through political influence from civil life, and foreign charlatans, the refuse of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>Many of our earlier military works (as will be mentioned hereafter) were modelled upon systems for a long time discarded by the profession in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and even some of those which have been constructed within the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> are made of such wretched materials and workmanship that they are already crumbling into ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>While the existing laws and regulations seem well calculated to prevent the recurrence of similar abuses and errors, it nevertheless can be shown that the organization of this arm of our service requires modifications and extensions to give it the requisite degree of efficiency, and to economize the public expenditures.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>The wars of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>. <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> led to a regular military organization, and a regular system of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>In these wars the engineers received great development, and have ever since occupied a prominent position as parts of an army organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>We therefore find in all the great sieges and battles of this era a large and continually increasing number of engineers and engineer troops, this orce being gradually <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>augmented as the true principles of war became better understood, and as the wants of the service required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>Even in the earliest of these battles we find the engineers taking a prominent and distinguished part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>In the war of <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct>, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> engineers were killed and wounded at the siege of Philipsbourg, <num value="18">eighteen</num> at <placeName reg="Namur, Namur, Wallonie" key="tgn,7007960">Namur</placeName>, <num value="8">eight</num> at Huy, <num value="10">ten</num> at <placeName reg="Charleroi, Province de Hainaut, Wallonie" key="tgn,7007869">Charleroi</placeName>, <num value="8">eight</num> at Ath, <num value="30">thirty</num> at <placeName key="tgn,7007426" n="1.000 3" reg="barcelona,barcelona,cataluna,espana,europe">Barcelona</placeName>, &amp;c. Such losses were good proofs of the usefulness of these officers, and before this war was closed, their number was increased to <num value="600">six hundred</num>; and in <dateStruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></dateStruct> the army contained <num value="8">eight</num> brigades of engineers and <num value="4">four</num> companies of miners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>The <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName> being partially disbanded in the early part of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>, great difficulty was experienced in reorganizing it and in finding competent men to supply the places of those who had been driven into exile or sacrificed during the reign of terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>Energy and activity, combined with republican zeal, could supply the place of skill in the other arms, but the science of the engineer could not be acquired in a day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>In <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, the staff of the <orgName n="Engineer Corps" type="corps">engineer corps</orgName> consisted of <num value="449">four hundred and forty-nine</num> officers, without including the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>, commanding departments, or those connected with the engineer troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>The same organization was continued in <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>The engineer staff of the <rs>French</rs> army now numbers <num value="432">four hundred and thirty-two</num> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>We have in our service <num value="43">forty-three</num> <rs type="role" reg="Engineer-Officer">engineer officers</rs>, for staff duty, who are now engaged in the construction and repairs of some <num value="60">sixty</num> or <num value="70">seventy</num> fortifications, and other works of a civil and military character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/><num value="2">II</num>. <hi rend="italics">Engineer Guards</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">Fort-Keepers</hi>, are a class of men charged with the general care of forts, and all public property deposited in the several engineer depots and garrisons, and in the <orgName n="Public Works" type="works">public works</orgName> during their construction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/>There are <num value="550">five hundred and fifty</num> of these <quote><hi rend="italics">gardens du</hi> <pb id="p.304" n="304"/><hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Genie</foreName></persName></hi></quote> in the <name>Freich</name> army, who rank next the sub-lieutenants of engineers, and are assimilated with the sub-lieutenants of infantry in the hospitals, marches, &amp;c. <hi rend="italics">In our service we have no engineer guards or fort-keepers</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>This defect in our organization has been the cause of serious inconvenience, and the consequent waste of public property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>The expense of hiring civil agents for this purpose has more than trebled the cost of supporting a suitable number of non-commrissioned guards to maintain the good order and efficiency of our forts, in the absence of engineer officers, and to preserve and keep in repair the military implements and stores connected with this department of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>It has already been shown that we have <num value="58">fifty-eight</num> of these guards for the artillery service, and it really seems somewhat singular that the engineers, with a much greater amount of public property in their charge, are allowed no assistants of this kind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/><num value="3">III</num>. <hi rend="italics">Engineer artificers</hi> are a class of men employed in the practical operations of constructing forts and other military defences, and in making and repairing all the implements used by the engineer troops in the operations of sapping and mining, in crossing rivers, in constructing field-defences, and in the attack and defence of field-works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>As very few new fortifications are now required in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 15" reg="france">France</placeName>, the services of engineer artificers are less necessary and important than in our service, where large sums of money are annually expended upon military defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>There are, however, in the <rs>French</rs> army a corps of engineer artificers, consisting of <num value="8">eight</num> officers and a cadre of <num value="54">fifty-four</num> non-commissioned officers, with a variable number of privates, organized into <num value="2">two</num> companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/><hi rend="italics">But in our army we have no regular engineer artificers</hi>! In our artillery service we have <num value="330">three hundred and thirty</num> enlisted artillery artificers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>If these are useful and necessary <pb id="p.305" n="305"/>to the artillery service, which no <num value="1">one</num> doubts, for still stronger reasons would it be advantageous to the public service to employ at least an equal number of enlisted engineer artificers on our fortifications; for the annual expenditure of public money is here much greater than in the corresponding branch of the artillery service.

In <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0053.0013.00305.00729" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Memoires,,,:2"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> organized <num value="5">five</num> battalions of these troops, consisting of <num value="165">165</num> officers and <num value="8865">8,865</num> men. Even this number was found insufficient in his campaigns in <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and he was obliged to organize an additional number of sappers from the <rs>Italian</rs> and <rs>French</rs> auxiliaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>The pioneers were then partly attached to other branches of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>There is, at present, in the <rs>French</rs> army a considerable number of sappers or pioneers detached for the service of the infantry regiments, <num value="3">three</num> companies of <hi rend="italics">sapeurs-conducteurs</hi>, and <num value="42">forty-two</num> companies of <hi rend="italics">sapcturs</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>In the preliminary stages of army organization under <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>., infantry troops were detailed as sappers, and. instructed in these duties by the engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>This irregularity of service soon caused difficulties and losses, and the evils springing from it were so great, that <persName n="Vauban,,,,," id="n0053.0013.00306.00732" reg="mostcommon:Vauban,nomatch:0"><surname>Vauban</surname></persName> urged the propriety of a separate organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>In fact, I have not the least doubt that they would save annually to the king much more than their pay. I assert all I have said on this subject with as much confidence as if I had seen the result; and I can, with the same certainty, add, that this small troop will be the means of saving large numbers of good engineers and brave officers and soldiers, from the stern necessity to which we are reduced of exposing, almost always, the laborers and those who support them; which necessity would not arise had we at command a sufficient number of this kind of workmen well instructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>To such a degree have I felt the necessity of sappers, at every siege at which I have been present, that I have always had reason to repent of not having more urgently solicited the creation of this company.</quote></p>

The preparation here meant is not the keeping up, in time of peace, of a large standing army, ever ready to take the field; but rather the formation of a small body, educated and practised in all the scientific and difficult parts of the profession; a body which shalt serve as the <hi rend="italics">cadre</hi> or framework of a large army, capable of imparting to the new and inexperienced soldiers of the republic that skill and efficiency which has been acquired by practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>How far have we accomplished this object, and what will be the probable operations in case of another contest with a European power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>New and inexperienced troops will be called into the field to oppose a veteran and disciplined army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>From these troops we shall expect all the bravery and energy resulting from ardent patriotism and an enthusiastic love of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>But we cannot here expect much discipline, military skill, or knowledge of the several branches of the military art. The peaceful habits of our citizens tend but little to the cultivation of the military character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>How, then, are we to oppose the hostile force?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>Must human blood be substituted for skill and preparation, and the dead bodies of our citizens serve as epaulements <pb id="p.325" n="325"/>against the inroads of the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>To some extent, we fear it must be the case ; but not entirely so, for government has not altogether neglected to make preparation for such an event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>Fortifications have been planned or erected on the most important and exposed positions; military materials and munitions have been collected in the public arsenals ; a military school has been organized to instruct in the military sciences ; there are regularly kept up small bodies of infantry and cavalry, weak in numbers, but capable of soon making good soldiers of a population so well versed as ours is in the use of the musket and the horse; an artillery force, proportionally much larger, is also regularly maintained, with a sufficient number of men and officers to organize and make good artillery-men of citizens already partially acquainted with the use of the cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>But an acquaintance within infantry, cavalry, and artillery duties is not the only practical knowledge requisite in war. In the practical operations of an army in the field, rivers are to be crossed, bridges suddenly erected and suddenly destroyed, fieldworks constructed and defended, batteries captured and destroyed; fortifications are to be put in order and defended, or to be besieged ad recaptured; trenches must be opened, mines sprung, batteries established, breaches made and stormed; trous-de-loup, abattis, palisades, gabions, fascines, and numerous other military implements and machinery are to be constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>Have our citizens a knowledge of these things, or have we provided in our military establishment for a body of men instructed and. practised in this branch of the military art, and capable of imparting to an army the necessary efficiency for this service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>Unfortunately this question must be answered in the negative ; and it is greatly to be feared that the future historian will have to say of us, as <persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n0053.0013.00325.00793" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName> has said of the <rs>English</rs>:--<quote><hi rend="italics">The best officers and soldiers were</hi> <pb id="p.326" n="326"/><hi rend="italics">obliged to sacrifice themselves in a lamentable manner, to compensate for the negligence and incapacity of a government always ready to plunge the nation into a war, without the slightest care of what was necessary to obtain success.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/><hi rend="italics">Fortification</hi> is defined,--the art of disposing the ground in such a manner as to enable a small number of troops to resist a larger army the longest time possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>If the work be placed in a position of much importance, and its materials be of a durable character, it is called permanent; if otherwise, it receives the appellation of <hi rend="italics">field</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">temporary</hi>. Field-works are properly confined to operations of a single campaign, and are used to strengthen positions which are to be occupied only for a short period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>Generally these works are of earth, thrown up by the troops in a single day. They are intimately connected with a system of permanent fortifications, but from the facility of their construction, no provision need be made for them before the actual breaking out of war. Indeed, they could not well be built before hostilities commenced, as their locality in each case must be determined by the position of the hostile forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Having already described the general influence of permanent fortifications as a means of national defence, we shall here speak merely of the principles of their construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>It is not proposed to enter into any technical discussion of matters that especially belong to the instruction of the engineer, but merely to give the nomenclature and use of the more important parts of a military work; in a word, such general information as should belong to officers of every grade and corps of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/><pb id="p.328" n="328"/></p> 
<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> species of fortification among the ancients was of course very simple, consisting merely of an earthen mound, or palisades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>A wall was afterwards used, and a ditch was then added to the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>It was found that a straight wall could be easily breached by the enemy's battering-rams; to remedy this evil, towers were built at short intervals from each other, forming a broken line of salient and re-entering parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>These towers or salient points gradually assumed a shape approximating to the modern bastion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>After the invention of gunpowder and the application of cannon to the attack and defence of places, it became necessary to arrange earthen ramparts behind the thin walls of the ancient works, for the reception of the <orgName n="New Artillery" type="artillery">new artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>Moreover these walls were soon found inadequate to resist the missiles of the besiegers, and it became necessary to replace them by parapets of earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>I. order to cover the retaining walls of these parapets from the besieging batteries, it was also found to be necessary to lower these walls as much as possible, and to raise the counterscarps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>The traces or plans of the works, however, received no material change till about the close of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> century.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>It is not known who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> changed the ancient towers into bastions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>Some attribute it to an Italian, and with considerable show of reason, for a bastion was built at <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName> as early as <dateStruct value="1461--"><year reg="1461">1461</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>Achmet Pacha, it is said, fortified <placeName key="tgn,7004093" n="1.000 4" reg="otranto,lecce,puglia,italia,europe">Otranto</placeName> in this way, in <dateStruct value="1480--"><year reg="1480">1480</year></dateStruct>, but whether the system was previously known among the <name>Turks</name> cannot be determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>Others attribute the invention to Ziska, the celebrated leader of the <name>Hussites</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>It is most probable that the transition from the tower to the bastion was a very gradual <num value="1">one</num>, and that the change was perfected in several countries at about the same time.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>The work by which the space fortified is immediately enveloped, is called the <hi rend="italics">enceinte</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">body of the place</hi>. Other works are usually added to the enceinte to strengthen the weak points of the fortification, or to lengthen the siege by forcing the enemy to gain possession of them before he can breach the body of the place: these are termed <hi rend="italics">outworks</hi>, when enveloped by the covered way, and <hi rend="italics">advanced works</hi>, when placed exterior to the covered way, but in some way connected with the main work; but if entirely beyond the glacis, and not within supporting distance of the fortress, they are called <hi rend="italics">detached works</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>In a bastioned front the principal outwork is the <hi rend="italics">demilune</hi>, which is placed in front of the curtain; it serves to cover the main entrance to the work, and to place the adjacent bastions in strong re-enterings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>The <hi rend="italics">tenaille</hi> is a small low work placed in the ditch, to cover the scarp wall of the curtain and flanks from the fire of the besieger's batteries erected along the crest of the glacis.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>The <hi rend="italics">places of arms</hi>, are points where troops are assembled in order to act on the exterior of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>The <hi rend="italics">reentering places of arms</hi>, are small redans arranged at the points of junction of the covered ways of the bastion and demi-lune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>The <hi rend="italics">salient places of arms</hi> are the parts of the covered way in. front of the salients of the bastion and demi-lune.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>Small permanent works, termed <hi rend="italics">redoubts</hi>, are placed <pb id="p.338" n="338"/>within the demi-lune arid re-entering places of arms for strengthening those works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>Works of this character constructed within the bastion are termed <hi rend="italics">interior retrenchments</hi>; when sufficiently elevated to command the exterior ground, they are called <hi rend="italics">cavaliers</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/><hi rend="italics">Caponniers</hi> are works constructed to cover the passage of the ditch from the tenaille to the gorge of the demilune, and also from the demi-lune to the covered way, by which communication may be maintained between the enceinte and outworks.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>In sea-coast defences, and sometimes in a land front for the defence of the ditch, embrasures are made in the scarp wall for the fire of artillery; the whole being protected from shells by a bomb-proof covering over head: this arrangement is termed a <hi rend="italics">casemate</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>Sometimes half embrasures are cut in the earthen parapet of a fort, so as to sink the gun below the crest, and thus more effectually cover the men from the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/><pb id="p.340" n="340"/>But guns in embrasure have a far less extended field of fire than when mounted in barbette; moreover, the embrasures present openings through which an enemy may penetrate in an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>Owing to these objections, they are employed only for the protection of particular points; that is, where it is important to cover the artillerists from the enemy's fire, or where the guns are to be used merely to protect a ditch, or to enfilade a road, &amp;c. The bottom of the embrasure is called the <hi rend="italics">sole</hi>, the sides are called <hi rend="italics">cheeks</hi>, and the mass of earth between <num value="2">two</num> embrasures, the <hi rend="italics">merlon</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>A <hi rend="italics">counterguard</hi> is a more extensive work, constructed in front of a part of the fortress itself, or of some other outwork of greater importance, which it is intended to cover.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>Sometimes outworks, called <hi rend="italics">tenaillons</hi>, consisting of <num value="1">one</num> long and <num value="1">one</num> short face, are placed on each side of the demi-lune of a front of fortification, for the purpose of prolonging the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>(Fig. <num value="41">41</num>.)</p> 
<p>Small, or <hi rend="italics">demi</hi>-tenaillons, are frequently so arranged as to cover only <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the demi-lune, and then a <hi rend="italics">bonnet</hi> constructed in front of the salient of the demi-lune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>(Fig. <num value="42">42</num>.) In this case the bonnet is flanked by the short faces of the demi-tenaillons ; these short faces are themselves flanked by the demi-lune, while the bastions flank the long faces.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>These works are also employed as advanced works and placed entirely in front of the glacis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>They have generally been added to a fortress for the purpose of occupylng some important piece of ground not included within the limits of the main work.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/><hi rend="italics">Field-Engineering</hi> includes the making of military, reconnaissances, temporary fortifications, and military roads; the planning and construction of military bridges; the attack and defeat of military works ;--in fine, all the various duties of engineer troops, either in the operations of a campaign, or in the dispositions on the battle-field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/><hi rend="italics">Military reconnaissance</hi>.--By this term is meant an examination of a portion of the theatre of war, to ascertain its military character and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>If the examination be made of a large district of country, and for an entire campaign, the reconnaissance is <hi rend="italics">general</hi>; if made for collecting detailed information respecting a proposed line of march, the passage of a river, the position of an enemy, &amp;c., it is termed <hi rend="italics">special</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>In making a general reconnaissance, great care should be taken to collect accurate information respecting the general topography of the country; the character of the mountains, forests, and watercourses; the nature of the roads, canals, and railways; the quality of the soil, and the amount of provisions and forage it produces ; the population and character of the cities, towns, and villages; the commercial and manufacturing resources of every part of the country, and the means of transportation to be found in each district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>The plan of military operations will be based on the information thus obtained, and any serious error in the reconnaissance may involve the results of the campaign, and even the fate of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>In a special reconnaissance, not only accurate but minute <pb id="p.343" n="343"/>information will be required: the character of the roads must be given in detail; the nature of the watercourses, their depth and velocity the position and character of bridges, and fords ;--in fine, a full description of all obstacles to be encountered, and the means that can be made available for overcoming these obstacles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>A reconnoitring officer may usually derive much valuable information from the published maps and descriptions of the country to be examined; additional matters of detail may be obtained from woodsmen, hunters, and fishermen; and also from the innkeepers and local authorities of the district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>But the officer should always verify this information, so far as practical, by personal examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>In making a reconnaissance in the vicinity of an enemy, he must be supported by a strong escort of mounted troops, and in all his operations the greatest precaution will be requisite to ensure success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>Some simple instrument, such as a, pocket sextant, or compass, will be sufficient to enable the reconnoitring officer to measure, with considerable accuracy, the height of mountains, the width of streams. &amp;c., and an ordinary scale and dividers will enable him to make a suitable military sketch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/><hi rend="italics">Temporary Fortification</hi>.--It has been stated in the preceding chapter that temporary fortifications are properly confined to the operations of a single campaign, and are used to strengthen positions which are to be occupied only for a short period ; and that they are usually made of earthly thrown up by the troops in a single day. Temporary fortifications, as a part of field-engineering, may therefore be regarded rather as an <hi rend="italics">arm</hi> than <hi rend="italics">art</hi>. The principles of their construction are derived, of course, from the theory of permanent fortification, but in applying these principles to practice in the field, much greater latitude is allowed than in the exact scientific arrangement of permanent works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/><pb id="p.344" n="344"/></p> 
<p>The purpose of field-works (or intrenchments, as they are commonly called) is to arrest, or at least to impede, the march of the attacking foe; to shelter the defensive troops from the missive weapons of the assailants, and to detain them in a position where they will be exposed to the fire of the defensive force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>The numerical and positive strength of the assailed may be much less than that of the assailant, and yet an equilibrium exist; the material obstacles compensating for the difference in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>Intrenchments, though inert masses, must therefore be regarded as most valuable and important accessaries in the defence of a position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>Intrenchments consist either of <hi rend="italics">lines</hi> of works made to cover extended positions, or of <hi rend="italics">detached</hi> works designed simply to defend the ground they occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>The former generally present a front against the enemy in but <num value="1">one</num> direction, while the latter are usually closed on all their sides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>The following figures have been employed for the plan of simple intrenchments, viz.: the polygon, redan, lunette, mitre, star-fort, and bastion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/><hi rend="italics">Square</hi> or <hi rend="italics">polygonal redoubts</hi> are the most common forms given to field-works, on account of the ease of their construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>But they have many defects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>There is a sector without fire in front of each salient, and the ditches are without protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>The latter objection also holds good against all circular works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>The <hi rend="italics">redan</hi> (Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/><num value="45">45</num>) is frequently used to cover a point in rear, as a bridge, a ford, or a defile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>When used alone, its gorge should be closed by palisades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Its ditches are unprotected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>The <hi rend="italics">lunette</hi> (Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/><num value="46">46</num>) has nearly the same defects as the redan.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/><hi rend="italics">The mitre</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">priest-cap</hi>, (Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/><num value="47">47</num>,) may be employed with advantage when a cross-fire is required on the capital of the work <pb id="p.345" n="345"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>The <hi rend="italics">star-fort</hi> has all the defects, without the merit of simplicity, which belong to the polygonal redoubt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>The <hi rend="italics">bastion-fort</hi> (Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/><num value="48">48</num>) more fully satisfies the conditions of a good defence than any other plan; but it is less simple and easy of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>It is usually composed of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> fronts, but it may be applied to a polygon of any number of sides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>For the details of the construction of these several works, we must refer to the special treatises on field-fortification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>Lines of intrenchments may be made either continuous or with intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>In adopting either plan, the engineer should avail himself of all the natural obstacles presented by the position, so as to diminish the labor of erecting artificial means of defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>The simplest arrangement for a continuous intrenchment is the <hi rend="italics">cremailliere</hi>, or indented line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>When applied to an irregular site, or used to connect together distant and detached works, the indented line may be regarded as a good disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>Mitres and redans, connected by straight curtains, are sometimes employed, as also a combination of large and small redans, forming alternate salient and re-entering angles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>A continuous line of bastions is preferable to any other arrangement, when there is plenty of time for their construction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>Lines with intervals are frequently formed of alternate lunettes and square redoubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>Other detached works may be employed in the same way. This manner of intrenching a position has several advantages, with disciplined troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock of the assailant is sustained by the detached works, and when he attempts to penetrate in the intervals, his flanks become exposed to a deadly cross fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>These intervals also allow the assailed to act on the offensive, by charging the enemy at the opportune moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>But with raw and militia forces it will be safer to resort <pb id="p.346" n="346"/>to continuous lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>If cavalry form any part of the defensive force, it will be absolutely necessary to leave intervals through which these troops may charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>A vertical section of all intrenchments is of the same general form; the dimensions will, of course, vary with the nature of the soil, and the time and means employed in their construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>The minimum dimensions that can be used with any considerable advantage are given in Fig. <num value="49">49</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>In laying out field-works advantage should be taken of all available artificial obstacles, such as hedges, walls, houses, outbuildings, &amp;c. A thickset hedge may be rendered defensible by throwing up against it a slight parapet of earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0053.0015.00346.00838" reg="mostcommon:Stone,nomatch:0"><surname>Stone</surname></persName> fences may be employed in the same way. Walls of masonry may be pierced with loopholes and arranged for <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> tiers of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>The walls of houses are pierced in the same manner, and a projecting wooden structure, termed a <hi rend="italics">machicoulis gallery</hi>, is sometimes made from the floor of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story, to enable the assailed to fire down upon their opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>This arrangement is frequently employed to advantage in wooden blockhouses against a savage foe; but it is of little avail when exposed to the fire of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>Some have proposed galleries of this description in permanent works of masonry, but the project is too obviously absurd to merit discussion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>In addition to the parapet of an intrenchment, a good engineer will always find time and means for constructing other artificial obstacles, such as trous-de-loup, abattis, palisades, stockades, fraises, chevaux-de-frise, crows'-feet, mines, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/><hi rend="italics">Trous-de-loup</hi> are pits dug in the earth in the form of an inverted truncated cone, some <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> in diameter, and about the same number of feet in depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>They are usually placed a few yards in front of the ditch, and concealed by some slight covering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/><hi rend="italics">Abattis</hi> are tops and large limbs of trees arranged along <pb id="p.347" n="347"/>the glacis of a work; the ends of the branches are lopped off and sharpened.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/><hi rend="italics">Palisades</hi> are stakes some <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> long, with <num value="1">one</num> end fastened in the ground and the other made sharp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>It is not necessary here to enter into any detailed discussion of the manner of constructing military communications through forests or marshes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>In a new country like ours, where almost every <num value="1">one</num> has had some experience in road-making, no very great technical knowledge is required for the construction of temporary works of this character; but much professional skill and experience will be requisite for the engineers who make the preliminary reconnaissances, and fix the location of these roads.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>Water-courses may be crossed by means of fords, on the ice, or by ferries and bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>When temporary <pb id="p.349" n="349"/>bridges or ferries are constructed by the army in the field, they are classed under the general head of <hi rend="italics">military bridges</hi>, or more properly, <hi rend="italics">pontoniering</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>The fords should be accurately staked out before the passage is attempted, and ropes ought to be stretched across the stream, or cavalry and small boats stationed below, to prevent the loss of life.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>An army can never trust, for any length of time, to either fords or ice; if it did a freshet or a thaw would place it in a most critical state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>Military bridges will, therefore, become its only safe reliance for keeping open its communications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>Military bridges are made with trestles, rafts, boats, and other floating bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3484"/>The sap-roller being placed along the line of the trench so as to cover the sapper in front, who is armed with a musket-proof headpiece and cuirass, this sapper commences the sap by placing a gabion on the line of the proposed trench and fills it with earth, working on his hands and knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/><hi rend="italics">Mines</hi>.--By <hi rend="italics">mining</hi>, as a military term, we understand the operations resorted to for the demolition, with powder, of a military structure of any description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>The term <hi rend="italics">mine</hi> is applied both to the excavation charged with powder for the purpose of producing an explosion, and to the communications which lead to this excavation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>The place in which the charge of powder is lodged is called the <hi rend="italics">chamber</hi>, the communication by which this place is reached the <hi rend="italics">gallery</hi>, and the excavation made by the explosion is termed the <hi rend="italics">crater</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>The form of the crater caused by an explosion in ordinary soils is assumed to be a truncated cone, the diameter, <hi rend="italics">c d</hi>, (Fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/><num value="53">53</num>,) of the lower circle being <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the diameter, <hi rend="italics">a b</hi>, of the upper circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>This form has never been ascertained to be exactly correct, but the theoretical results deduced from a mathematical discussion of this figure have been fully verified in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>The radius, <hi rend="italics">p b</hi>, of the upper circle is termed the <hi rend="italics">crater radius</hi>; the line <hi rend="italics">o p</hi>, drawn from the centre of the charge perpendicular to the surface where the explosion takes place, is termed the <hi rend="italics">line of least resistance</hi>; the line <hi rend="italics">o b</hi>, drawn from the centre of the powder to any point in the circumference of the upper circle, is termed the <hi rend="italics">radius of explosion</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>When the crater radius is equal to the line of least resistance, the mine is termed <hi rend="italics">common</hi>; when this radius is greater than the line of least resistance, the mine is termed <hi rend="italics">overcharged</hi>; and when the radius is less, <hi rend="italics">undercharged</hi>. A mine of small dimensions, formed by sinking a shaft in the ground, is termed a <hi rend="italics">fougasse</hi>. The term <hi rend="italics">camouflet</hi> is applied to a mine used to suffocate the enemy's miner, without producing an explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>Small mines <pb id="p.361" n="361"/>made in rock or masonry, merely for the purpose of excavation, without any considerable external explosion, are called <hi rend="italics">blasts</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3503"/>From experiments made on common mines, whose line of least resistance did not exceed <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure>, it has been ascertained that the tenacity of the earth is completely destroyed around the crater to a distance equal to the crater radius, and that empty galleries would be broken in at once and <num value="0.5">a half</num> that distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>It has also been proved by experiment, that the crater radius in overcharged mines may be increased to <num value="6">six</num> times the line of least resistance, but not much beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>this; that within this limit the diameter of the crater increases nearly in the ratio of the square roots of the charge; and that empty galleries may be destroyed by overcharged mines at the distance of <num value="4">four</num> times the line of least resistance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>By means of the deductions of physico-mathematical theory, and the results of experiments, rules have been determined by which the miner can calculate, with much accuracy, the charge necessary to produce a required result in any given soil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>In the earlier stages of the history of this art, mines were only used to open breaches and demolish masses of masonry; but in later times they have been employed as important elements in the attack and defence of places.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>An isolated wall, only <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> thick, may readily be demolished by exploding <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2casks" type="mass">two casks</measure> of powder placed in contact with its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>If the wall be <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> thick, the charges should be placed under the foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>For walls of still greater thickness it will be best to open a gallery to the centre of the wall, a foot or <num value="2">two</num> above its base, and place the powder in chambers thus excavated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>Revetment walls may be overturned by placing the charges at the back of the wall, about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> or <num value="1">one</num>-quarter of the way up from the <pb id="p.362" n="362"/>base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>If placed too near the base, a breach will be made in the wall without overturning it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>To demolish a bridge of masonry the powder should be lodged in chambers excavated in the centre of the piers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>When there is not time for excavating these chambers in the piers, a trench may be cut over the key of the arch, in which the powder is placed and exploded; or, the casks of powder may be suspended immediately under the arch, with the same results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>Where a saving of powder is of consequence, small chambers may be excavated in the haunches of the arch, and the mine carefully <hi rend="italics">tamped</hi> before firing it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>Bridges of wood may be destroyed by suspending casks of powder under the principal timbers, or attaching them to the supports.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>Palisading, gates, doors, &amp;c., may be destroyed in the same way, by suspending casks or bags of powder against their sides; or still more effectually, by burying the charges just beneath their base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>To demolish a tower, magazine, or house, of masonry, place charges of powder under the piers and principal walls of the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>In wooden structures the powder should be placed under, or attached to the principal supports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>Where time is wanting to effect these arrangements, a building may be blown down by placing a large mass of powder in the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>The powder may be economized, in this case, by putting it in a strong case, which should be connected with the walls of the building on all sides by wooden props.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>Special treatises on military mining contain full instructions for regulating the size and position of the charge for the various cases that may be met with in the practical operations of field-engineering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>As applied to the attack and defence of a fortified place, mines are divided into <num value="2">two</num> general classes--<hi rend="italics">offensive</hi> and <pb id="p.363" n="363"/><hi rend="italics">defensive</hi> mines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>The former are employed by the besiegers to overthrow the scarps and counterscarps of the place, to demolish barriers, palisades, walls, and other temporary means of defence, and to destroy the mines of the besieged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>The latter are employed by the opposite party to blow up the besiegers' works of attack, and to defend the passage of ditches against an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>Small mines called <hi rend="italics">fougasses</hi> may be employed for the last named object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>The <hi rend="italics">shell-fougasse</hi> is composed of a wooden box filled with <num value="1">one</num> or more tiers of shells, and buried just below the surface of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Sometimes a quantity of powder is placed under the shells, so as to project them into the air previous to their explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>The <hi rend="italics">stone fougasse</hi> is formed by making a funnel-shaped excavation, some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> deep, and placing at the bottom a charge of powder enclosed in a box, and covered with a strong wooden shield; several cubic yards of pebbles, broken stone, or brickbats, are placed against the shield, and earth well rammed round, to prevent he explosion from talking place in the wrong direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>These mines are fired by means of powder hose, or by wires connected with a galvanic battery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>The defensive mines employed to blow up the besiegers' works, are generally common mines with the lines of least resistance seldom greater than <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure>. All the main galleries and principal branches of mines for a permanent fortification are constructed at the same time with the other portions of the work, leaving only the secondary branches, chambers, &amp;c., to be made during the siege, For the general arrangement of these galleries, and the precautions necessary for their protection from the operations of the besiegers, reference must be made to treatises specially devoted to the discussion of this subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>Mines can seldom be employed with advantage in works of slight relief, and liable to an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>But if judiciously <pb id="p.364" n="364"/>arranged in the plan of their construction, and well managed during the operations of the siege, they contribute very materially to the length of the defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/><hi rend="italics">Attack and defence</hi>.--This subject admits of <num value="2">two</num> natural divisions: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, of intrenchments, and <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, of permanent works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>I. Intrenchments may be attacked either by <hi rend="italics">surprise</hi>, or by <hi rend="italics">open force</hi>. In either case the operations should be based on exact information of the strength of the works and the number and character of the garrison-information that can be obtained from spies, deserters, and prisoners, and confirmed by examinations or reconnaissances made by officers of engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>By these means a pretty accurate knowledge may be obtained of the natural features of the ground exterior to the works; their weak and strong points; and their interior arrangements for defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>In an attack by surprise, the troops should consist of a storming party and a reserve of picked men. The attacking column is preceded by a company of sappers armed with axes, shovels, picks, crowbars, &amp;c.; bags of powder are also used for blowing down gates, palisades, &amp;c. All the operations must be carried on with the utmost dispatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>The time most favorable for a surprise is an hour or <num value="2">two</num> before day, as at this moment the sentinels are generally less vigilant, and the garrison in a profound sleep; moreover, the subsequent operations, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> surprise, will be facilitated by the approach of day. Under certain circumstances, it may be advisable to make false attacks at the same time with the true <num value="1">one</num>, in order to distract the attention of the garrison from the true point of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>But false attacks have, in general, the objection of dividing the forces of the assailants as well as of the assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>In all attacks by surprise, secrecy is the soul of the enterprise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>In an open assault, if artillery be employed, the troops <pb id="p.365" n="365"/>should be drawn up in a sheltered position, until the fire of the works is silenced, and breaches effected in the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>But if the bayonet alone be resorted to, the troops are immediately brought forward at the beginning of the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>The attack is begun by a storming party of picked men: they are preceded, as before, by a body of sappers, provided with necessary means for removing obstacles, and followed by a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> detachment of engineers, who will widen the passages, and render them more accessible to the main body of troops who now advance to the assistance of the storming party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>If the assailants should be arrested at the counterscarp by obstacles which must be removed before any farther progress can be made, the infantry troops of the detachment display and open a fire upon the assailed, in order to divert their fire from the sappers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>A few pieces of <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, on the flanks of the column, may sometimes be employed for this purpose with great advantage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>The storming party should always be provided with scaling-ladders, planks, fascines, &amp;c., for crossing the ditch, and mounting the scarp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>If the counterscarp be revetted with masonry, the troops must either descend by ladders, or fill up the ditch with fascines, bales of straw, bundles of wool, &amp;c.: if not revetted, a passage for the troops into the ditch will soon be formed by the shovels of the sappers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>When the ditch is gained, shelter is sought in a dead angle till the means are prepared for mounting the scarp, and storming the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>If the scarp be of earth only, the sappers will soon prepare a passage for the escalade; but if revetted with masonry, the walls must be breached with hollow shot, or scaled by means of ladders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>In the defence, the strictest vigilance should be at all times exerted to guard against a surprise : sentinels are posted on all the most commanding points of the work; all the avenues of approach are most thoroughly guarded, <pb id="p.366" n="366"/>and patroles are constantly scouring the ground in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>At night all these precautions are redoubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>Light and fire-balls are thrown out in front of the work to light up the ground, and discover the movements and approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>Each man should have his particular post assigned to him, and be thoroughly instructed in the duties he will have to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>All auxiliary arrangements, such as palisades, abattis, &amp;c., should be defended with the utmost obstinacy; the longer the enemy is held in check by these obstacles, the longer will he be exposed to the grape and musketry of the main work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>When he assaults the parapet, he will be opposed by the bayonet in front and a well-aimed fire in flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>While in the ditch, or as he mounts the scarp, hollow projectiles, incendiary preparations, stones, logs, &amp;c., will be rolled down upon his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>But when the assaulting column has gained the top of the scarp, the bayonet forms the most effective means of resistance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>The measures resorted to in the attack and defence of the larger class of field-works, will necessarily partake much of the nature of the operations employed in the attack and defence of permanent fortifications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/><num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>The attack and defence of a fortress may be carried on either by a regular siege, or by irregular operations and an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>The latter plan has sometimes been adopted when the works of the place were weak and improperly defended; where the time and means were wanting for conducting a regular siege; or where the assailants were ignorant of the means proper to be resorted to for the reduction of the fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>Such operations, however, are usually attended by an immense sacrifice of human life, and the general who neglects to employ all the resources of the engineer's art in carrying on a siege, is justly chargeable with the lives of his men. In the siege of <placeName reg="Cambrai, Nord, Nord-Pas-de-Calais" key="tgn,7008456">Cambrai</placeName>, <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>., on the solicitation of <persName n="Metz,,Du,,," id="n0053.0015.00366.00862" reg="default:Metz,Du,,,"><foreName>Du</foreName> <surname>Metz</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.367" n="367"/>but contrary to the advice of <persName n="Vauban,,,,," id="n0053.0015.00367.00863" reg="mostcommon:Vauban,nomatch:0"><surname>Vauban</surname></persName>, ordered the demilune to be taken by assault, instead of waiting for the result of a regular siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>The assault was made, but it was unsuccessful, and the <rs>French</rs> sustained great losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>The king now directed <persName n="Vauban,,,,," id="n0053.0015.00367.00864" reg="mostcommon:Vauban,nomatch:0"><surname>Vauban</surname></persName> to take the demi-lune by regular approaches, which was done in a very short time, and with a loss of <hi rend="italics">only <num value="5">five</num> men</hi>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>The king directed the regular works to be continued, and the next day the place was taken with but little loss to the besiegers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>But a work may be of such a character as to render it unnecessary to resort to all the works of attack which would be required for the reduction of a regular bastioned fort, on a horizontal site.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>For example : the nature of the ground may be such as to enable the troops to approach to the foot of the glacis, without erecting any works whatever; of course, all the works up to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> parallel may in this case be dispensed with without any violation of the rules of a siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>Again, the point of attack may be such that the other parts of the place will not flank the works, of approach; here a single line of <hi rend="italics">boyaux</hi>, and short parallels may be all-sufficient.</p>

The object of the <hi rend="italics">investment of the place is</hi> to cut off all communication between the work and the exterior, thus preventing it from receiving succors, provisions, and military munitions, and also to facilitate a close reconnoissance of the place by the engineers, who should always accompany the investing corps, and pursue their labors under its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>This corps should be composed chiefly of light troops &mdash; cavalry, <orgName n="Light Infantry" type="infantry">light infantry</orgName>, <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName>, <quote>brigades of engineers and mounted sappers,</quote> --who march in advance of the besieging army, and, by a sudden movement, surround the work, seize upon all the avenues of approach, and carry off every thing without the world that can be of service either to the garrison or to the besiegers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/>To effect this object, the enterprise must be conducted with secrecy and dispatch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>The investing corps is now distributed around the work in the most favorable positions for cutting off all access to it, and also to prevent any communication with the exterior by detachments from the garrison, and even single individuals are sent out to give intelligence to a succoring army or to reconnoitre the operations of the besieging corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3582"/>These posts and sentinels, called the <hi rend="italics">daily cordon</hi>, are placed some mile or mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from the work, and beyond the reach of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>But in the night-time these posts are insufficient to accomplish their object, and consequently as soon as it is dark the troops move up as close to the work as possible without being exposed to the fire of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3584"/>This arrangement constitutes the <hi rend="italics">nightly cordon</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/>By the time the main army arrives the reconnoissance will be sufficiently complete to enable the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Engineer">chief engineer</rs> to lay before the general the outline of his plan of attack, so as to establish the position of his depots and camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3586"/>These will be placed some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from the work, according to the nature of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3587"/>As they occupy a <pb id="p.369" n="369"/>considerable extent of ground around the work, it will generally be necessary to form intrenchments strong enough to prevent succors of troops, provisions, &amp;c., from being thrown into the place, and also to restrain the excursions of the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>The works thrown up between the camp and besieged place are termed the <hi rend="italics">line of countervallation</hi>, and those on the exterior side of the camp form the <hi rend="italics">line of circumvallation</hi>. These lines are generally about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>It is not unusual in modern warfare to dispense with lines of circumvallation, (except a few detached works for covering the parks of the engineers and artillery,) and to hold the succoring army in check by means of an opposing force, called the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Army of Observation" type="army">army of observation</orgName></hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>The measures of defence resorted to by the garrison will, of course, be subordinate, in some degree, to those of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>As soon as any danger of an investment is apprehended, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> should collect into the place all the necessary provisions, forage, military munitions, &amp;c., to be found in the surrounding country; all useless persons should be expelled from the garrison; a supply of timber for the works of the engineers and artillery, fascines, gabions, palisades, &amp;c., prepared; all ground within cannon range around the work levelled; hedges and trees cut down; holes filled up ; temporary buildings demolished or burnt; and all obstacles capable of covering an enemy and interrupting the fire of the work, removed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>During this period the engineer troops and working parties detached from the other arms will be most actively employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>As soon as the investing corps makes its appearance, bodies of light troops are thrown out to cut off reconnoitring parties, and, if possible, to draw the enemy into ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3594"/>To facilitate these exterior operations, and to prevent a surprise, several guns of long range are <pb id="p.370" n="370"/>placed on the salients of the bastions and demi-lunes, and others, loaded with grape, in the embrasures of the flanks so as to sweep the ditches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3601"/><hi rend="italics">The parallels</hi> are the long lines of trench which envelop the besieged work, and serve both as covered ways for the circulation of the besiegers, and as means of defence against sorties from the garrison; they are therefore arranged with banquettes for musketry fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3602"/>The boyaux are trenches run in a zigzag direction along the capitals of the front of attack, and are intended exclusively for the circulation of the troops; they have no banquettes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>The operations of defence during this period are so directed as to harass the workmen in the trenches and retard the advance of the works of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>These parties are composed of light troops who charge the guards <pb id="p.372" n="372"/>and compel the workmen to abandon their sapping tools and stand upon the defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>They are most effective when the besiegers commence the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> parallel, as the guards in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parallel are not so immediately at hand to protect the workmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>When the sortie detachment has driven these workmen from the trenches, instead of pursuing them into the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parallel, it will display itself in battle order to cover the engineer troops, (who should always accompany the detachment in this enterprise,) while they fill up the trenches and destroy the implements of the besiegers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>When the guards of the trenches appear in force, the detachment will retire in such a way, if possible, as to draw the enemy within range of the grape and musketry of the collateral works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>These sorties, if successful, may be frequently repeated, for they tend very much to prolong the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>The best time for making them is an hour or <num value="2">two</num> before day, when the workmen and guards are fatigued with the labors of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>While the besiegers are establishing their enfilading batteries, a strong fire of solid shot and shells will be concentrated on the points selected for their construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>The garrison will also labor during this period to put the work into a complete state of defence: constructing all necessary palisadings, traverses, blindages, barriers; and strengthening, if necessary, the covering of the magazines.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>When this fire has produced its effect in. clearing the outworks, picked troops will sally forth and carry the covered way with the bayonet, sheltering themselves <pb id="p.373" n="373"/>behind the traverses until the sappers throw up a trench some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5yards" type="distance">five yards</measure> from the crest of the glacis, high enough to protect the troops from the fire of the besieged.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>When the covered way is to be crowned by regular approaches, a <hi rend="italics">double sap</hi> is pushed forward from the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> parallel to within <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> of the salient of the covered way; the trench is then extended some <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure> to the right or left, and the earth thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>ap high enough to enable the besiegers to obtain a plunging fire into the covered way, and thus prevent the enemy from occupying it. This mound of earth is termed a <hi rend="italics">trench cavalier</hi>, (<num value="0">0</num>.) Boyaux are now pushed forward to the crowning of the covered way and the establishing of breach batteries, (J.) Descents are then constructed into the ditches, and as soon as these batteries have made a breach into the walls of the bastions and outworks, the boyaux are pushed across the ditches and lodgments effected in the breaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>The demi-lune is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> carried; next the demi-lune redoubt and bastion; and lastly, the interior retrenchments and citadel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>In some cases the breaches are carried by assault, but the same objection is applicable here as in the storming of the covered way; <hi rend="italics">time is gained, but at an immense expense of human life</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>If the place is defended by mines it will be necessary for the besiegers to counteract the effects of these works by resorting to the slow and tedious operations of a subterranean warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>In this case a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> trench is formed in front of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> parallel; shafts are sunk in this, about <measure n="6yards" type="distance">six yards</measure> apart, for establishing overcharged mines; as soon.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>The measures of defence during this period must embrace every thing calculated to retard the works of the besiegers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>This may be most effectually accomplished by maintaining a constant fire of grape and musketry on the heads of the sap, and throwing grenades, shells, &amp;c., into the trenches, to harass and destroy the workmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>As the musketry fire of the besiegers now becomes very destructive to the artillerists at the guns, strong musket-proof blinds are arranged to mask the mouths of the embrasures when the guns are not in battery, and also sloping blindages to cover the men when serving at the pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>The possession of the outworks should be disputed inch by inch, and when the besiegers have reached the ditch of the body of the place, sorties, and every species of projectile, should be employed to drive off the sappers, and to retard the construction of their works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>In fine, all the resources of the engineer's art should be put in requisition for the defence of the breach, and the final assault should be vigorously resisted by the bayonet, and by a well-sustained fire from all the collateral works.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>With respect to the relative strength of the opposing forces it may be well to remark, that if the fortress is properly constructed the garrison will be able to resist a besieging army <hi rend="italics"><num value="6">six</num> times</hi> as numerous as itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>Nevertheless, it has occasionally met with strong opposition; this opposition springing in part from a want of proper information respecting the character and working of the system, and in part from the combined efforts of those who from negligence or incapacity have failed to pass their examinations for promotion, and of those who, from a conscious want of qualifications or merit, feel assured that they cannot obtain commissions in the army so long as this system of merit, as fixed by examination, shall <pb id="p.382" n="382"/>exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/><quote>The laws now regulate military promotion; the king can appoint or promote only in conformity to legal prescriptions; and even in the exercise of this prerogative, he is wise enough to restrain himself by certain fixed rules, which protect him from intrigues, and from the obsessions of persons of influence, and of party politicians.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3877"/>Would <pb id="p.403" n="403"/>that the same could always be said of the executive of this country in making appointments and promotions in the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>The existing laws and regulations of the <rs>French</rs> service differ slightly for different corps, but the general rule is as follows: No <num value="1">one</num> can be appointed to the grade of officer in the army who has not graduated at <num value="1">one</num> of the military schools, or has not served at least <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> as a subofficer in a <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>.

For promotion by selection, a list of the authorized candidates for each grade is made out every year by inspectors, and boards of examiners appointed <hi rend="italics">ad hoc</hi>, and the name, qualifications, and particular claim are given of each officer admitted to the <hi rend="italics">contours</hi>. The recommendations of these inspectors and examiners are almost invariably followed by the government in its selections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>This combined system of seniority and merit secures a gradual promotion to all, and at the same time enables officers of great talents and acquirements to attain the higher grades while <pb id="p.404" n="404"/>still young and efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>Merit need not, therefore, always linger in the subaltern grades, and be held subordinate to ignorance and stupidity, merely because they happen to be endowed with the privileges of seniority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>Moreover, government is precluded from thrusting its own favorites into the higher grades, and placing them over the heads of abler and better men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>If such a system of appointment were introduced into our army, and fixed by legal enactments, and no <num value="1">one</num> were allowed to receive a commission till he had either distinguished himself in the field, or had passed an examination before a board of competent officers, we are confident that better selections would be made in the appointments from civil life than have been within the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> by the present system of political influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>It would scarcely be possible to make worse selections.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/> 
<p>To show the working of this system of political appointments, we would call attention to a single fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3887"/>On the formation of an additional regiment of dragoons in <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>, <hi rend="italics"><num value="30">thirty</num></hi> of its officers were appointed from civil life, and only <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num></hi> from the graduates of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3888"/>Of those appointed to that regiment from civil life, <hi rend="italics"><num value="22">twenty-two</num></hi> have already been dismissed or resigned, (most of the latter to save themselves from being dismissed,) and only <hi rend="italics"><num value="8">eight</num></hi> of the whole <hi rend="italics"><num value="30">thirty</num></hi> political appointments are now left, their places having been mainly supplied by graduates of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3889"/>In case of another increase of our military establishment, what course will our government pursue?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3890"/>Will it again pass by the meritorious young officers of our army,--graduates of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>,--who have spent <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num> of the best years of their life in qualifying themselves for the higher duties of their profession, and place over their heads civilians of less education and inferior character-men totally ignorant of military duties, mere pothouse politicians, and the base hirelings of party,--those who screech the loudest in favor of party measures, and degrade themselves the most in order to serve party ends?--and by thus devoting the army, like the custom-house and <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, to political purposes, will it seek to increase that vast patronage of the executive which is already debasing individual morality, and destroying the national character?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3891"/>Should any administration of the government be so unmindful of the interests and honor of the country as to again pursue such a course, it is to be hoped that the sword of political justice will not long slumber in its scabbard.</p></note> And if the combined <pb id="p.405" n="405"/>system of seniority and examination were pursued in promoting the subalterns already in service, it certainly would produce less injustice, and give greater efficiency to the army, than the present <num value="1">one</num> of exclusive seniority and brevet rank, obtained through intrigue and political influence, or high military appointments bestowed as a reward for dirty and corrupt party services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>As a military maxim, <hi rend="italics">secure efficiency, by limiting the privileges of rank; exclude favoritism, by giving the power of selection to boards of competent officers, totally independent of party politics</hi>. Such a system has been for some time pursued in the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName> of our army; it has produced the most satisfactory results; stupidity, ignorance, and aged inefficiency have been <hi rend="italics">overslaughed</hi>, and will soon entirely disappear from that corps; they have been replaced by young men of activity, talent, character, intelligence, and great professional skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>Is it less important to have competent military officers to command where the lives of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, the honor of our flag, the safety of the country depend upon their judgment and conduct, than it is to have competent surgeons to attend the sick and the wounded?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>We wish to call particular attention to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>It deserves attention at all times, but at the present moment it more especially demands a close and candid consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>The higher grades of our peace establishment are now filled with men so far advanced in life that, in case of an increase of the army, many of them must undoubtedly be either passed over, or put on a retired list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>Sooner or later some change of this kind will undoubtedly be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>It is demanded by the good of service, even in time of peace; and in time of war, it will be absolutely <pb id="p.406" n="406"/>necessary to the success of our arms.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/> 
<p>Even at the present moment, in ordering troops to <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, where immediate and active service is anticipated, it is found necessary to break up regiments and send only the young and efficient officers into the field, leaving most of the higher officers behind with mere nominal commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>Very many of the officers now in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> are acting in capacities far above their nominal grades, but without receiving the rank, pay, and emoluments due to their services.</p></note> But the great danger is that the change may be made for the worse &mdash; that all the appointments and promotions to the higher grades will be made through political influence, thus converting the army and navy into political engines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>Let proper measures be taken to prevent so dangerous a result; let executive patronage in the army be limited by wholesome laws, like those in <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>; and let military merit and services, as determined by boards of competent military officers, be the only recognised claims to appointment and promotion, thus giving to the poor and meritorious at least an equal chance with the man. of wealth and the base hireling of party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>In actual service the system of exclusive seniority cannot exist; it would deaden and paralyze all our energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>Taking advantage of this, politicians will drive us to the opposite extreme, unless the executive authority be limited by wholesome laws, based on the just principles of <hi rend="italics">merit</hi> and <hi rend="italics">service</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>But the importance of maintaining in our military organization a suitable system of military instruction is not confined to the exigencies of our actual condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3905"/>It mainly rests upon the absolute necessity of having in the country a body of men who shall devote themselves to the cultivation of military science, so as to be able to compete with the military science of the transatlantic powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>It is not to be expected that our citizen soldiery, however intelligent, patriotic, and brave they may be, can make <pb id="p.407" n="407"/>any very great progress in military studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3907"/>They have neither the time nor opportunities for such pursuits, and if they can acquire a practical acquaintance with elementary tactics &mdash; the mere alphabet of the military art &mdash; it is as much as can reasonably be expected of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3908"/>As a general rule, the militia are individually more capable and intelligent than the men who compose a regular army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3909"/>But they must of necessity be inferior in practical professional knowledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3910"/>Technical education is necessary in every pursuit of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3911"/>It is possible that the lawyer may succeed in some particular cases without a knowledge of law, but he will probably have few clients if he remain ignorant of the laws and precedents that govern the courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3912"/>The unlearned chemist may succeed in performing some single experiment, but his progress will be slow and uncertain if he neglect to make himself familiar with the experiments and discoveries of his predecessors.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3913"/>Learning, when applied to agriculture, raises it from a mere mechanical drudgery to the dignity of a science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3914"/>By analyzing the composition of the soil we cultivate, we learn its capacity for improvement, and gain the power to stimulate the earth to the most bountiful production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3915"/>How different the results attending the labors of the intelligent agriculturist, guided by the lamp of learning, from those of the ignorant drudge who follows the barren formula of traditional precepts!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3916"/>As applied to manufactures and the mechanical arts, learning develops new powers of labor, and new facilities for subsistence and enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3917"/>Personal comforts of every kind are greatly increased, and placed within the reach of the humbler classes; while at the same time the <quote>appliances of art are made to minister to the demands of elegant taste, and a higher moral culture.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3918"/>As applied to commerce, it not only greatly increases the facilities for the more general diffusion of civilization and <pb id="p.408" n="408"/>knowledge, but is also vastly influential in harmonizing the conflicting interests of nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3919"/>Nor is learning less humanizing and pacific in its influence when applied to the military art. <quote>During the dark ages which followed the wreck of the <rs>Roman</rs> power, the military science by which that power had been reared, was lost with other branches of learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3920"/>When learning revived, the military art revived with it, and contributed not a little to the restoration of the empire of mind over that of brute force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3921"/>Then, too, every great discovery in the art of war has a life-saving and peace-promoting influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3922"/>The effects of the invention of gunpowder are a familiar proof of this remark; and the same principle applies to the discoveries of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3923"/>By perfecting ourselves in military science, paradoxical as it may seem, we are therefore assisting in the diffusion of peace, and hastening on the approach of that period when swords shall be beaten into ploughshares and spears into pruning-hooks.</quote>
