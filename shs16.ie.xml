<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>This old town of <placeName reg="Winnsboro, Fairfield, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096961">Winnsboro</placeName> has been twice the headquarters of an invading army, once burned, and twice ravaged by an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>In each instance the excuse was that its inhabitants were in rebellion; but as they ultimately succeeded in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, history has been so kind as to substitute the term <q direct="unspecified">Revolution</q> for that of <q direct="unspecified">Rebellion</q>; as they failed in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, it has left them to that</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l part="F">foul dishonoring word,</l> <l>Whose wrongful blights so oft has stained</l> <l>The holiest cause that tongue or sword</l> <l>Of mortal ever lost or gained.</l></lg>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In both instances these invasions followed the fall of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and disaster to our arms elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, however, ultimately ended with the surrender <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> of the <rs>British</rs> under <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> and the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the invaders found the men of the country present to resist if not repel, and were repaid in some degree at least for their vandalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The <rs>Englishmen</rs> and the <name>Huguenots</name> had come into the province by the sea, and had pushed their way into the interior, following the courses of the rivers, but their settlements did not extend beyond the points we now know as <placeName reg="Camden, Kershaw, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095449">Camden</placeName>, <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Hamburg, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095935">Hamburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The meeting-house and the school-house, rough structures it is true, were built together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The extent of their instruction was, no doubt, limited, but the children were taught to speak the truth and to defend it, to keep a conscience and to fear <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;the foundation of good <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> citizens and great men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They claimed the right to choose those who should frame their laws, contending that rulers as well as the meanest subjects were bound by law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/><placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> proved no exception to the rule.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>At that time the president of <orgName n="Washington College" type="college">Washington College</orgName> was a Northern man by education and birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>He was an excellent scholar and an eminent divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>In politics he was a Unionist of the most pronounced and uncompromising type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>He had boldly proclaimed from the pulpit that he would rather have a negro in the <name>Presidential</name> chair than see the <rs>Union</rs> dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>For the cadets of the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> he had no love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Whenever any deviltry was committed at night, particularly when some of his favorite fruit disappeared from his garden between <num value="2">two</num> suns, the doer of the deed was, in his opinion, some <q direct="unspecified">little bobtailed cadet.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The bitter Union spirit of the president of the <rs type="place">College</rs> seemed to intensify and make more demonstrative the <name>Secession</name> spirit of the students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>If the <name>Secession</name> flag, found in the morning floating from the cupola of the college, was removed by orders of the president during the day, it was sure to be replaced by determined students during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>Finally the students prevailed, and the president of the <rs type="place">College</rs> resigned and returned to his native State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>At the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> the sentiment of the cadets was generally for Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/><pb id="p.38" n="38"/> While many, particularly from the cotton States, were pronounced in their views, there was no violence of expression and no clash of opinion with the officers and professors of the <rs type="place">Institute</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The latter, whatever their political opinions, were prudent in language and conservative in bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>As good soldiers of the <rs>State</rs>, they were ready and willing to follow her fortunes, however she might command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>But while there was no turbulence of spirit or relaxation of discipline, there was with the cadets an increasing interest in public affairs, an eager watching of the moves then being made on the political chessboards at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName> and <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00038.00469" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,Henry,,,:3"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, and a decreasing interest in all academic studies, save those which pertained to military science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Several cadets, whose States had seceded, resigned their cadetships and hurried home to offer their services to the new confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>All were restless, and the most of them anxious for the opportunities of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>In the town, the <name>Secession</name> sentiment was slowly gaining ground, not so much from desire for the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> as from a feeling that Secession was becoming a dire necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>The ignominious failure of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; the fruitless efforts of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 22" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to effect a compromise and avert the storm&mdash;efforts generously persevered in until she was taunted by her enemies and distrusted by her friends&mdash;the persistent preparation of the government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for the reinforcement of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, which many believed was intended to provoke resistance and force the <rs>South</rs> into an overt act; all this had not only caused many conservative men to despair of a peaceable solution of the questions of the day, but was forcing upon them the belief that, by longer delay to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, the old Commonwealth was compromising her honor and allowing time for the forging of shackles to bind her hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>Still the <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> remained largely in the majority in the county if not in the town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>At a Secession meeting, in the early spring, a tall pole had been erected on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> in front of the courthouse and a Secession flag unfurled from its top and left to fringe its edges in the crisp mountain breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Not to be outdone, and to show their greater strength, the <name>Unionists</name> set a day in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> for a mammoth Union demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>They decided to erect on that occasion a pole near by which should tower above the <name>Secession</name> pole, and to fly from its peak a <orgName n="Union Banner" type="newspaper">Union banner</orgName> which should make the <name>Secession</name> flag below look insignificant by comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>As none of the neighboring forests could furnish a single tree that would answer this purpose, a pole was <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> to be made of segments from several trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>Accordingly, suitable parts were procured and hauled into position, the scarfs cut and the rings made, and everything was in readiness for putting the pole together on the following day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>But during the night some hot-blooded young Secessionists attempted to destroy the butt piece of the pole by boring holes in it and charging them with powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>This plan proving a failure, the top segment was then carried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>It would be difficult to depicit the looks of the <name>Unionists</name> when this discovery was made the next morning, or to describe their feelings of vexation and rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>Denunciation was bitter, and threats of vengeance became more violent as the nature of the act was realized and the crowd increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>It was rumored that cadets in citizens' dress had been seen in town long after tap,, and that college students had been met on the streets under suspicious circumstances at suspicious hours of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Fortunate was it that no cadet or student was in reach at that exciting hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>This act caused more bitterness than delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>With great pluck and determination the <name>Unionists</name> soon either recovered or replaced the missing piece, the pole was erected, and the grand rally for the <rs>Union</rs> took place at the appointed time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>There was a great gathering of clans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>People poured in from every part of the county&mdash;from highland and glen, from lowland and bog.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>Before the war there were no academic duties at the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> on <date value="--6">Saturdays</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Between inspection, from <num value="8">8</num> to <time value="9am">9 o'clock A. M.</time>, and dress-parade, a little before sunset, all cadets, except those on guard duty, were allowed to go beyond the limits; but they were required to be at dinner roll-call at <time value="1pm">1 P. M.</time>, unless specially excused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>Naturally, many cadets went up town immediately after inspection to witness the <rs>Union</rs> parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Political feeling was bitter, and on the part of the <name>Unionists</name> some mutterings were heard; but up to <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time> there had been no serious outbreak, if any conflict at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>After dinner a few cadets returned to town, and some strolled off in other directions, but the majority repaired to quarters, either to discuss the issues of the day or to enjoy an afternoon nap; for it was <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and if there was any thing a cadet considered a luxury it was sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Abundance of exercise and a minimum of rest&mdash;retiring at taps at <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, and rising at reveille at <num value="5">five</num>&mdash;his sleep was generally so monotonously sound that it was often a pleasure to be aroused during the night to enjoy the delightful sensation of falling asleep again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>For this reason, cadets not unfrequently <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> requested the corporal of the guard to wake them on visiting their rooms at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>To the exclamation of Sancho Panza, <q direct="unspecified">Blessed be the man who invented sleep!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>the whole corps would have responded with a hearty <q direct="unspecified">Amen!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/></p> 
<p>Soon all steps had ceased on stairs and stoops, and many a cadet lay stretched out on his narrow couch, his thoughts of the present or visions of the future quickly fading away in sleep, or taking the forms of reality in dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>Suddenly he springs to his feet, listens for a moment, to assure himself that it is not a dream, seizes his arms and accoutrements and hurries from his room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>It is the call to arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>In an instant the whole building is astir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>From every room, on every stoop, down every stairs, and through the lofty archway, cadets, accoutred and armed, are rushing to the front of barracks (as the main building is commonly called).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>Although but little attention had been paid to the threats of the <name>Unionists</name> against the would-be destroyers of their pole, a few cadets had been apprehensive of trouble as the day wore on. These, therefore, suspected the cause of the alarm from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tap of the drum, and some of them loaded their muskets immediately on leaving their rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Other cadets blindly followed their example.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>About <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> in rear of the archway, and flanked by the wings of barracks, stood the <orgName n="State Arsenal" type="arsenal">State arsenal</orgName>, in which were stored many <num value="1000">thousand</num> stand of arms, mostly flintlock muskets of the <name>Revolutionary</name> model.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>(This building, together with the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> buildings, was destroyed by <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n0273.0004.00040.00470" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,Robert,Mercer,Taliaferro:1,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, in his unsuccessful expedition against <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and was never rebuilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>On the contrary, the blackened walls and rubbish were removed and the ground leveled, so that of the old arsenal searcely a vestige remains today).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The guarding of this depository of arms was <num value="1">one</num> of the duties of the corps of cadets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>(In fact, this arsenal was the germ of the <orgName n="Virginia Military Institute" type="institute">Virginia Military Institute</orgName>). About the time of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00040.00471" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,A.,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inauguration, it had been rumored that an attempt would be made to capture the arsenal and remove the arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Who the attacking parties were to be, rumor did not state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The report probably grew out of the apprehension of some excitable Secessionist, or the boast of some over-zealous <placeName reg="Unionist">Unionist</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>Of course many gave credence to the rumor, and throughout the whole corps there was a feeling of anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time the long roll had been beaten in the small hours of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>In a few minutes the battalion, accoutred and armed, was in line in front of barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>It was a false alarm, the <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> object of which was to test the rapidity with which the corps could be assembled in an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>The next day at dress-parade ball cartridges were distributed, <num value="10">ten</num> rounds to each musket&mdash;a small supply, it is true, but sufficient to inspire confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>These cartridges, intact, were in possession of the cadets on that memorable <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>On this occasion it was no false alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Information had just been brought in breathless haste from the town, that several cadets had been assaulted and beaten by <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00041.00472" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName>, and then carried off under arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>The report spread immediately throughout the corps, those in front repeating it to those behind, so that it was known by every cadet before he had reached the front of barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Therefore no explanation was needed; and certain it is that no persuasion was required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Right or wrong, every cadet was actuated by the same impulse&mdash;eagerness and impatience for the rescue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The cadet battalion was composed of <num value="4">four</num> companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>But on that afternoon, owing to the absence of some of the ranking cadet officers, and the failure of any of those present to assume the responsibility, no orders were given, and no attention was paid to company organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>On the contrary, the cadets, as fast as they came up, took their places in ranks without command, and moved off toward the town without a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The fact is (and the admission is made with some feeling of mortification even to-day), the movement of the cadets, when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> started off, was very unlike that of a column of disciplined soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>It might have been expected otherwise of a body of intelligent young men, educated and trained at such a military school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>But if there was wanting the coolness of veterans, there was an abundance of determination and dash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>If there was an absence of order and plan, it must be remembered that there was no time for deliberation, but that hot-headed, impetuous youth were unexpectedly called on to rescue their comrades from the violence of an infuriated political mob.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>To the courthouse, near the centre of the town, it was about <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure>. It could be reached by <num value="2">two</num> lines of march&mdash;the upper, or principal route, passing the <rs type="place">College</rs> and <orgName n="Grace Church" type="church">Grace Church</orgName>; the lower route leading by a broad pathway diagonally across the front slope of the <placeName reg="Institute, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118709">Institute</placeName> hill, down into the <rs type="place">Valley turnpike</rs> below, and thence up <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> by <placeName><persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n0273.0004.00041.00473" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,John,,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>'s house</placeName> and <placeName reg="Craft's Hotel">Craft's Hotel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>The former route was the <num value="1">one</num> taken on anniversary parades, the latter was the more direct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/><address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> slopes gradually downward nearly from its western <pb id="p.42" n="42"/> extremity to where, with a reversed curve, it joins the turnpike not far from the <rs type="place">Institute</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Such is the commanding elevation of the <rs type="place">Institute grounds</rs>, that, looking southwest, nearly the whole of this street is in view from a point a little east of the courthouse almost to its western limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>It will now be understood that, to the many persons gathered in front of the courthouse, the cadets were not only visible when assembling in front of barracks, but, having taken the lower route, they were in full view the greater part of the way when moving down the front slope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Whether or not an attack had been expected, the movement seems to have been understood at once by many persons in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>The alarm was instantly given and rapidly spread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The scene that followed was <num value="1">one</num> of the wildest tumult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Anxious mothers ran about the streets seeking their frightened children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Excited men rushed from house to house and store to store to provide themselves with such arms and ammunition as they could obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>In a few minutes the supply of buckshot was exhausted in every store within reach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It happened that the <num value="2">two</num> local military organizations were taking part in the proceedings of the day-<num value="1">one</num> a <orgName n="Infantry Company" type="company">company of infantry</orgName> known as the <orgName n="Rockbridge Rifles" type="rifles">Rockbridge Rifles</orgName>, neatly uniformed, well armed and fairly drilled; the other a squadron of cavalry, newly organized, but neither drilled nor equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The Rifles, hastily supplied with ammunition and reinforced by many citizens armed with shot-guns and other weapons, took possession of the courthouse and the corners near by, ready and determined to receive with deadly fire the advancing column of cadets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>After reaching the turnpike the cadets, who from force of habit had assumed the order of march in columns of fours, were out of sight of the central part of the town, the route being here for several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> hidden from view by trees and houses and the curve in the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>By this time the corps had been joined by most of the absentees from barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>These, hurrying in from different directions and securing their arms, had come up in a run, so that the column was now over <num value="200">two hundred</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The movement had become formidable and alarming indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>It was no holiday parade, no <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>-of-<dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> march to town, when, with martial music, waving banner, neatest uniform, burnished plates and gleamings guns, the battalion moved gayly along the upper route, all hearts aglow at the thought of the bright eyes that would greet them on the way, and jubilant in anticipation of the brilliant ball that would close the year's exercises at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Now, with determined mien, these impetuous <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> youth are moving forward, silently, but with quick and resolute step, imagining little and recking less the danger ahead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>At that time the superintendent of the <rs type="place">Institute</rs>, <persName n="Smith,Colonel,Francis,H.,," id="n0273.0004.00043.00474" reg="default:Smith,Francis,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> (now <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> and venerable with years), was an invalid in his chamber recovering from an attack of pneumonia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>His attention being arrested by the beating of the drum, he went to the window and saw the cadets moving down the hill, many loading their guns as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>He did not know the cause, but was sure trouble was brewing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Hurrying as soon as possible across the parade ground and through private lots, he reached the street in time to bring the column of cadets to a halt between <placeName><persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n0273.0004.00043.00475" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,John,,,:3"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>'s house</placeName> and <placeName reg="Craft's Hotel">Craft's Hotel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>A few moments more and the head of the column would have rounded the curve in the street and appeared in full view and range of those ready and waiting to meet its attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Fortunate halt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>It doubtless saved the corps from destruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Just after the column had halted, the steps of approaching men were heard on the plank-walk around the bend in the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Instantly every eye was turned in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p></p> 
<p>Here they come!</p></quote> exclaimed the son of the lamented <rs type="role" reg="Bishop-General">Bishop-General</rs> of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and, weeping with rage, he stepped a little to the left for a quicker view, cocked his musket, and brought it to the position of aim. <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/></p> 
<p>Don't fire, you fool you!</p></quote> cried a cadet officer near by, who seized the gun and pushed it up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The footsteps proved to be those of a committee of citizens from the town, who were hurrying to meet the cadets, and if possible prevent bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>In the meantime other officers of the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> had arrived on the ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>The ear of the corps was quickly caught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>No authority was asserted, no threats were made, but with the voice of sympathy the superintendent showed his coolness and wisdom by saying to the cadets that although he did not know the cause of the threatened contest between them and the citizens of the town, he claimed the right to lead them in the fight, but he must insist on a prompt obedience to orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/><q direct="unspecified">All right!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>cried the cadets, whose confidence was thus won. The spokesman of the committee then stepped forward and made a strong appeal to the cadets to desist from violence, assuring them of the release of their comrades, and of ample redress for all wrongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The cadets being satisfied by this assurance, the superintendent gave the command, <q direct="unspecified">Right-face!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>forward, march!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>and the corps returned promptly to barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The rattle of musketry <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> when, after entering the <rs type="place">Institute grounds</rs>, the cadets discharged their loaded guns in the air, must have sent a shudder of horror through many an anxious heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>After returning to barracks the cadets were assembled in <orgName n="section"><persName n="Preston,Major,,,," id="n0273.0004.00044.00476" reg="mostcommon:Preston,J.,T.,L.,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>'s section</orgName>-room, which had the largest seating capacity in the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The object of this meeting was the pacification of the cadets and the prevention of further trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>To this end speeches were made by the superintendent and others, and then a long pause ensued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Amongst the academic officers present was <num value="1">one</num> who was conspicuous by the bolt-upright position in which he sat. His body did not touch the back of his chair, and his large hands rested motionless on his thighs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Usually he kept his eyes to the front, but on this occasion he was closely scanning the faces and reading the thoughts of the young men before him. This person was no other than <persName n="Jackson,Major,Thomas,Jonathan,," id="n0273.0004.00044.00477" reg="default:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>In church he always sat in the same posture, never touching the back of the pew nor turning his eyes from the preacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>If during a dull sermon he ever fell asleep (and he had been seen to close his eyes at times) he always retained this position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>It is no wonder that he afterwards received&mdash;with the baptism of fire&mdash;the immortal name of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00044.00478" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0273.0004.00044.00479" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> then seemed most eminent for <name>Christian</name> piety, a stern, unwavering sense of duty, a noble straightforwardness, and a beautiful simplicity of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>In short, he exhibited that strong individuality which always accompanies genius, but which the world's stupidity characterizes only as eccentricity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>In this age he would have been called a crank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>His singularity was often ridiculed, and his peculiar ways were a subject of mimicry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>Although possessing such manly virtues, he was regarded by cadets and others as <q direct="unspecified">a failure</q> as a teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>He was wanting in tact in the class-room, although he afterwards displayed such brilliant tactics in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>In his classes he never asked leading questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>If the student was not familiar with the subject, and requested a repetition of the question, with the hope of a change of words embodying a useful hint, he was sure to get it again in the identical words, and even with the same emphasis and peculiar intonation of voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>By some this was considered indicative of lack of thoroughness in the subjects he professed to teach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>But the fact is, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00044.00480" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had but <num value="1">one</num> way of saying things, and that the best matured and most direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>He was clumsy, and often unsatisfactory in his experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>All <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> this, together with his eccentricity, caused him to be looked upon as an unpractical man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>He was also unpopular with some of the professors, and amongst the cadets he was regarded as the butt of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>At times, on his way to and from barracks, walking as usual with measured step, body erect and eyes to the front, cadets have been known to throw stones just in front of him, not to strike him, but on a wager that he could not be made to look around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>On he would go, without ever turning his head or changing his gait, or, as some have alleged, without even blinking his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Up to the time the writer became a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-class man, when, by the voluntary action of his, the leading section, such conduct was broken up, it had been the custom of many of the members of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s classes to create wanton disorder in his section-room, often to the extent of downright disrespect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>He was imperturbable throughout it all, never losing his dignity nor seeming in the least annoyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>But if held by many in low estimate as a teacher of Physics and Astronomy, he was respected by all for the gallantry he had displayed in the <rs>Mexican War</rs>. His military record was well known, and criticism of his methods in the class-room was frequently off-set by some such remark as, <q direct="unspecified">But old <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00045.00481" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> knows how to fight.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>His conscientious discharge of duty and uniform soldierly bearing could not but be admired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>As an instructor in artillery tactics he gave satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>His explanations of the battery movements were clear and concise, and his commands were given with determination and force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>He alone of all the officers of the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> pronounced the word <q direct="unspecified">oblique</q> in his commands as if spelled <hi rend="italics">oblike</hi>. Another peculiarity was the manner in which he carried his sabre when walking to or from duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Although belted around him, he invariably held it in a horizontal position, well up under his left arm, handle to the rear, curved edge up, and left hand seizing the scabbard near the middle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Now that civil war was daily becoming more probable, and the strain of excitement was too great for much interest in academic studies, <persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0273.0004.00045.00482" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> began to be estimated less by his qualifications for the class-room than by his fitness for the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Men, as well as women, admire the brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>That <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00045.00483" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> possessed courage, no <num value="1">one</num> doubted; that he was well suited for subordinate command, and, if so ordered, would march unflinchingly into the jaws of death, every <num value="1">one</num> believed; but if asked to name the professor at the <rs type="place">Institute</rs> most likely to rise to the highest rank and win <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> the greatest fame in the event of war, probably <num value="4">four</num> cadets out of <num value="5">five</num> would have thought of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0273.0004.00046.00484" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> last.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>As mentioned above, after several speeches had been made there ensued a long pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Perhaps some reply was expected from the cadets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>At last the painful silence was broken by a cadet crying out, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Jackson,Major,,,," id="n0273.0004.00046.00485" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The cry was taken up by others, until it became general and continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Aware of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s awkwardness and shyness, many may have called for him in the spirit of mischief; but doubtless the majority of the cadets, knowing his straightforwardness and sense of justice, desired from him some expression of approval or sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Rising from his seat, he was greeted with loud applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>He waited till the noise subsided; then, with body erect and eyes sparkling, as they did so often afterwards on the field of battle, he said, with a vigor and fluency that were a surprise to all: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Soon after getting in position, orders came for us to throw up breastworks in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>There were few, if any, spades or shovels, but the men realizing the necessity for the order, as a heavy force was immediately in our front, split their canteens, making scoops of them, and, together with their bayonets and their hands, for the soil was light and sandy, soon had a very respectable earthwork thrown up, and, lying down behind it, it was not long before we were all sleeping soundly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The next day we remained in that position, but the morning after I received orders to take my company to the foot of the hill and <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> occupy the picket line near the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The men concealed themselves behind trees, stumps and logs, or constructed hasty rifle-pits, and the enemy's picket line being on the opposite side of the creek, only partially concealed among the scrubby pines and broom sedge, the opposing lines soon commenced a desultory fire upon each other, and it was not long before the artillery of the <num value="2">two</num> forces engaged in the fight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>This cannonading soon grew heavy, and other batteries joining in from the opposite side, we found ourselves the centre of the most furious cannonading we had ever before experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>There was no advance made by the infantry of either force during this <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> duel, but it seemed as if all the gun and <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar batteries</orgName> in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00499" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had been let loose on <persName n="Breckenridge,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00500" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>'s devoted division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>His few batteries responded with spirit, and returned the fire until they were badly crippled, while the infantry&mdash;not being brought into action and having nothing to do&mdash;cowered for protection from the death-dealing shot and shell in the piece of woods on our left, and behind every available defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Many were killed and maimed, but the troops were not dislodged from their position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>We ascertained afterwards that <persName n="Breckenridge,General,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00501" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>, having taken his position after dark, had by some mistake gotten nearly a mile beyond the alignment of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00502" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s line of battle and was drawn up within long rifle range of the enemy, who at that point consisted of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00503" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,W.,S.,,:1"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>So it was, that when daylight disclosed our position to the enemy he concentrated the fire of his heavy guns on <persName n="Breckenridge,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00504" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>, who found himself the centre of a long line of artillery practice, while the other batteries of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00048.00505" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> were not near enough to render their support of much assistance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>I do not know what our loss was in this artillery fight, only recollect that <num value="2">two</num> men in my own company were killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/><num value="1">One</num> of them while lying down was struck on the back by a large piece of descending shell and cut in <num value="2">two</num>, poor fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The other had gone to the rear a mile with a detail to cook and was on his way back to the line with a camp-kettle full of corn-bread and beef on his arm when the cannonading commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>He ran towards the breastworks for protection, while the hungry men in the trenches watched his race through the ploughing shot and shell, almost as solicitous for the safety of their breakfast, perhaps, as for that of their comrade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Just before the poor fellow reached us, however, a shell exploded directly in front of him, and when the smoke cleared away the bloody fragments <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> of the man and the scattered contents of the camp-kettle lay mingled together on the ground before our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>It is said that from the fullness of the heart the mouth speaketh, but on this occasion speech came from the emptiness of <num value="1">one</num> poor soldier's stomach, when looking upon the ghastly wreck before us, he exclaimed: <q direct="unspecified">Lora, boys, just look, <persName n="Flint,,Joe,,," id="n0273.0005.00049.00506" reg="default:Flint,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Flint</surname></persName> is all mixed up with our breakfast, and it aint fit for nothing!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Such want of sentiment, or feeling if you like, sounds strange and heartless to us now, but in those times of courage and every-day suffering, the hungry soldier's remark, finding an echo in the empty stomachs of his fellows, did not seem so much out of place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Another incident I recollect as very characteristic of those times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>There was in <orgName type="company" n="Company F">Company F</orgName> a man by the name of <persName n="Ford,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00049.00507" reg="mostcommon:Ford,nomatch:0"><surname>Ford</surname></persName>, who was so disfigured by a hump that his position in the company line always interfered with its proper dressing, and I generally left him in quarters when I wished the company to appear at its best.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Before this shelling of our position commenced, <placeName reg="John Ford">John Ford</placeName> had been placed on the advanced picket line and his position happened to be in a sandy bottom near the creek, where he had sheltered himself behind an uprooted tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>He could be plainly seen by many of the men, crouching low in the sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>In the midst of the cannonading a large mortar shell without exploding, fell in the sand a few feet from him, the fuse still smoking and spitting and an explosion momentarily imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> took in the situation at a glance, and doubtless arguing that if he jumped up to run, the shell might explode before he got out of reach and tear him to pieces, and that the safest thing for him to do was to get down into the ground, commenced at once to work down into the sand with hands, legs and head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>My attention was attracted by the men hollering <q direct="unspecified">scratch <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>scratch! she's a going off!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>and looking in the direction where I had last seen him, I witnessed an amusing spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>Never was a man more dead in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>The sand all around him was in commotion, and in the few seconds that the fizzing fuse gave him, he burrowed like a great gopher till nothing but the top of his hump could be seen as the loose sand settled around it. I held my breath expecting the next <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to see the poor fellow blown to atoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Then the explosion came with a tremendous jar that shook the ground and sent a <num value="100">hundred</num> pieces of iron singing through the air. We all kept our eyes fixed upon the spot as the smoke and dust slowly lifted, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight that came to view was the head of <persName n="Ford,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00049.00508" reg="mostcommon:Ford,nomatch:0"><surname>Ford</surname></persName>, happily, still on his shoulders, and as he realized that he was <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> all right, he looked back at us and sang out <q direct="unspecified">Who-eeh</q> as cheerily as if he had treed a coon instead of been face to face with death a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>An answering cheer and a laugh went up from the boys on the line, and the incident was the next minute forgotten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>Just before the shelling commenced, I was sitting on the ground among some low bushes with pencil and paper, writing upon my knee what I thought might be my last letter to my wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>The pickets had been for some time keeping up a dropping and uninteresting fire as they would catch a glimpse of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Presently, <num value="1">one</num> after another, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> minies dropped in the bushes near, and as each <num value="1">one</num> seemed to cut a little closer, I thought a sharpshooter with a telescopic rifle, which we understood the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName></q> were using, had perhaps been attracted by my white paper and it would be safest to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>I did so, and getting up leaned against an oak tree, something larger than my body, which stood near, but the next minute I thought the earth had opened and that I and the tree were falling into it. As soon as I could shake myself together and rub some burnt powder out of my eyes, I realised that a shell had burst against the tree right behind me, the pieces striking the ground all around, throwing sand and leaves all over me. The concussion was so great, that I had to pass a hand over each limb and feel myself all over before I could be sure that I was not wounded, during which investigation <persName n="Cowley,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0273.0005.00050.00509" reg="mostcommon:Cowley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Cowley</surname></persName> ran up and congratulated me on being alive, saying that as he knew where I had been sitting a minute before and hearing the shell explode at the spot, he had come expecting <q direct="unspecified">to pick up what was left of me.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/></p> 
<p>After that fierce artillery duel was over, there was no further passage at arms between the opposing forces on this part of the line, except the continuous but irregular firing between the pickets, which lasted until it got too dark to see.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>And now we on the picket line&mdash;tired out with the constant activity of the day and the cramped position which most of the time we were forced to keep in the narrow, single rifle-pits&mdash;looked anxiously for the appearance of the <q direct="unspecified">relief.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Independently of the physical strain that the picket has to endure, the sense of responsibility, as he feels himself to be the eyes and ears of the army, is an intense mental tax, that no <num value="1">one</num> but he who has experienced it can realize.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>But there was no rest for us that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Instead of the <q direct="unspecified">relief</q> came an orderly with a squad heavily loaded with ammunition, and these were the orders he brought: Said he, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Edgar,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0005.00050.00510" reg="nearbymention:Edgar,George,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Edgar</surname></persName> says you are to keep your company on the picket line all night, <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> keep a close watch on the enemy, and in the morning annoy him all you can, and try to keep up the impression that our command is in the breastworks, still on the top of the hill above you, but we will not be there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/><persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00511" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> has discovered that his division is out of line nearly a mile too far to the front, and he is going to retire it at once, and in order that we may have time to fortify our new position he directs that you carry out your part of the ruse he is going to play on the enemy, by fighting as though the main body were directly in your rear, and that you hold your position until the enemy forces you out of it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/><q direct="unspecified">And what then?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>said I. <q direct="unspecified">Well, he says when you can't stay here any longer, you must get back to the command the best way you can, and I have brought you <num value="60">sixty</num> rounds of extra ammunition to do your extra fighting with.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/><q direct="unspecified">Are we to have any reinforcements, sergeant?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/><q direct="unspecified">No, sir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>And so we were in for it, and after making things as snug as circumstances would admit of, I sat down in my rifle-pit and began to think of home, and wife and children, whom I never expected to see again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>For what chance could <num value="200">two hundred</num> or so of men have in retreating a mile across open fields with <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00513" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,W.,S.,,:1"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s whole corps right after them and on them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>for we had to stay in our rifle-pits until they drove us out. As I sat there thinking, as I had never thought before, for never had death seemed so near, I heard a familiar voice in the dark calling my name in a low tone, for the enemy's line was within ear-shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Answering in the same tone, <persName n="Swann,Captain,John,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00514" reg="default:Swann,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Swann</surname></persName>, whose company was on my right, came up and asked me <q direct="unspecified">What orders I had?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>I told him. <q direct="unspecified">I have the same d&mdash;&mdash;n orders,</q> said he. <q direct="unspecified">We'll all be in hell or <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> before to-morrow night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>What matter is that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>We won't be missed down here,</q> he went on to say. <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00515" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> will report to-morrow night that in the morning he had had a skirmish in his front, his pickets engaging the enemy on <placeName><persName n="Taylor,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00516" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,W.,H.,,:8"><surname>Taylor</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, and only lost about <measure n="200" type="killed and missing">two hundred killed and missing</measure>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>That's all of us, you know, but we aren't hardly worth counting down here among all these men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>After talking over the situation and trying to arrange for some plan of concerted action with <persName n="Pratt,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00517" reg="mostcommon:Pratt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Pratt</surname></persName>, of <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Derrick,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00051.00518" reg="mostcommon:Derrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Derrick</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName>, whose company was also in line on my left, we parted, and soon after, squatting in my rifle-pit, I was fast asleep, nor did I awake till the noise of an exploding shell near aroused me to find the sun <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> shining brightly in my face as my head rested on the edge of the pit where I sat, while a Yankee gunner seemed to be practicing on different points along our line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Having no artillery with which to reply, we made no answer to that challenge, but after a while some of the enemy's infantry began to show themselves incautiously, and we let them have it with our long range rifles, and a brisk fire opened from the rifle-pits on both sides, which lasted, with some intermission, for several hours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Finally, the enemy concluded he would try the tactics of the day before, and commenced shelling with great fury our empty breastworks on the top of the hill behind us. Getting no response from the empty fortifications, after a good deal of waste of ammunition, the fire slackened and there was a lull all along both lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Just then occurred <num value="1">one</num> of those episodes in the conflict peculiar, I believe, to that civil war of ours, and showing that the men who fought it were akin, despite all the blood that was shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Looking far down the line to my right, I saw a Confederate walking boldly down the hill towards the creek carrying a white rag aloft on a stick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Startled, I called to a lieutenant and asked what that meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Said he, <q direct="unspecified">I don't understand it; he is not <num value="1">one</num> of our company.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>In another moment, however, it was all plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>A <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Yank,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00052.00519" reg="mostcommon:Yank,nomatch:0"><surname>Yank</surname></persName></q> was seen advancing to meet the <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Johnny</foreName></persName>,</q> as they called our boys, also carrying a white flag, and they were <q direct="unspecified">on a trade.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I understood afterwards, that during the lull in the firing <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's pickets had called across to his <hi rend="italics">vis-a-vis</hi>. <q direct="unspecified">Hello, <persName><foreName>Johnny</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Got any good tobacco?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes; good as you ever chawed!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/><q direct="unspecified">How'll you swap for some <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class <persName n="Rio,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00052.00520" reg="mostcommon:Rio,nomatch:0"><surname>Rio</surname></persName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/><q direct="unspecified">All right.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, meet meat the creek, and don't you fellows shoot till I get back, and we won't either.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>So the swap was made, whether with the consent of any officer, I never knew, but I dreaded the consequences of letting the <rs>Federal</rs> soldier get that near to our line, lest he should spy out its thinness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The whole thing may have been concocted on that side with that very end in view, for soon after the men had returned to their posts, there was an unusual stir among them over in the pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Loud commands could be heard, and we could catch glimpses of moving lines of men in blue, which seemed to thicken near the edge of the <q direct="unspecified">piney woods.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/></p> 
<p>At last a lieutenant near me cried, <q direct="unspecified">There they come!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>get ready for them, boys!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>I called out, <q direct="unspecified">And don't fire until you see their eyes!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Soon a long, close battle-line, several ranks deep, moved out of the cover and marched rapidly down the hill toward the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/><pb id="p.53" n="53"/> When they got nearly to the brush, which lined the creek's banks, a well-directed fire blazed all along our line of rifle-pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Every man had taken dead aim, and almost the whole front rank of the enemy went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The confusion among them was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>They struggled forward a few paces, only to receive another rattling volley, and then broke and ran back to the shelter of the pines, followed by the yells and cheers of our brave fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Again there was a lull in the firing, and we could distinctly hear the officers berating their men in the pines for giving away before a picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Oaths, and even sabre blows, could be plainly distinguished as the lines were reformed, and we knew we were to have it again very soon, and prepared for the tug of war which it was plain was now upon us. <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/></p> 
<p>Forward! Forward! <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>!</p></quote> were the orders we heard repeated from many voices along their concealed line, and then out of the thicket they burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/><q direct="unspecified">Double-quick!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>and down the hill they swept in a long trot, many, many times our numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>When they reached the <q direct="unspecified">dead line</q> we again poured a well directed fire into their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Scores fell in their tracks, but they answered with another volley, a huzzah that went to our hearts, and plunged into the brush and through the creek; no stop now, and on our side they came, and now it was plain that the time when we <q direct="unspecified">could not stand any longer and must retreat</q> had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/><q direct="unspecified">Retreat! Retreat!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>rang out along our long, thin line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The boys hustled out of their pits and away they scampered up the hill, pursued by the yelling enemy and volleys of ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Many fell, but the others pressed on to the top of the hill, paused in our old breastworks to turn round and give them a parting volley and then pushed on again across the wide level towards the distant wood where our division lay&mdash;by this time well entrenched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>But now, as ill-luck would have it, danger appeared from a new direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>The enemy, under the cover of the piece of wood on our left, had sent a force around with a battery and flanked us, and had we been a few minutes later abandoning our position they would have been in our rear and bagged the whole force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>As it was, they poured a galling fire into our flank, while the batteries from the hills in our late front, now our rear, opened on us to add to our discomfiture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Thus, admidst the whistle of minies, the bursting of shells and the whir of grape, we made our perilous way over the open fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Our only chance was to make a show of resistance, by loading as we ran, facing about and firing back at our pursuing foe, while the thinness and irregularity of our line was in our favor, for it took a good shot to bring down <num value="1">one</num> of our men, and we had a comparatively close <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> line to fire into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Nevertheless, what between the fire of the enemy and the fatigue of the retreat, we lost at every step, and when at last we dragged ourselves up to the welcome breastwork (I thought it was the dearest pile of logs and dirt I had ever beheld), it was a fearfully thinned line that climbed over and flung itself down bleeding and panting behind that grateful shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>But <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0273.0005.00054.00521" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s object had been accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>We sat upon the breastwork to the right of the point where the scrimmage took place, and with indescribable satisfaction and restfulness watched our boys charge our late antagonists in their pits and gather them in.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>That night we slept on our arms, and the next day moved again to our right to prevent <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00054.00525" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s flanking, and helping him to carry out his threat and <q direct="unspecified">fight it out on that line if it did take all summer.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/></p> 
<p>It was probably <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after this, during which we were constantly moving and halting, forming line of battle, sleeping on our arms, breaking the line and moving again, when we brought up in front of <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> afternoon, the <dateStruct value="-06-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>From all the signs which a soldier soon learns, it was evident that we were upon the eve of a great battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The massing of troops, the placing of batteries, the hurrying of staff-officers, the galloping to and fro of couriers and orderlies, and the something indescribable in the faces of the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs>, meant business as plainly as if it had been spoken.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The afternoon before the battle, our command was ordered to take position in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>A force of dismounted cavalry occupied the field, and were lying behind a low ridge of earth they had hastily thrown up to protect themselves from the enemy's sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>We were ordered to relieve them, which we did, under a galling fire from concealed riflemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Again was our position unfortunately chosen, being too far back from the brow of the slight eminence where we were posted, and an angle or salient about the centre of the line occupied by <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Edgar,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00055.00539" reg="nearbymention:Edgar,George,M.,,"><surname>Edgar</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> was thrown too far forward and exposed our part of the line to a concentrated fire from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>But we now had to make the most of it and stand or fall where we were.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>No sooner had we settled ourselves in our position than our men, who were handy with dirt&mdash;being most of them farmers and laboring men&mdash;set themselves to strengthening our breastworks, and it was not long before they presented a pretty fair protection against the constant fire from the enemy's pickets and sharp shooters, who were strongly posted in a piece of wood land immediately in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>So galling did this fire become, that <persName n="Edgar,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0005.00055.00540" reg="nearbymention:Edgar,George,M.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Edgar</surname></persName> determined to dislodge the force of pickets if possible, and ordered out a skirmish line consisting of <num value="2">two</num> companies, <orgName type="company" n="Company B">Company B</orgName>, <persName n="Read,Captain,E.,J.,," id="n0273.0005.00055.00541" reg="default:Read,E.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Read</surname></persName>'s, being <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>I do not recollect the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>But they met such a well-directed fire from the protected enemy, that they could not proceed far, and had to throw themselves flat upon the ground and behind logs and stumps to escape annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/><num value="1">One</num> by <num value="1">one</num> they made their way back to the breastworks, many of them wounded and several left dead in the timber; among the wounded were <persName n="Read,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0005.00055.00542" reg="nearbymention:Read,E.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Read</surname></persName> and <persName n="Patton,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0273.0005.00055.00543" reg="mostcommon:Patton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Patton</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>The day wore on, the sun was getting down in the west, and the enemy were evidently massing in our front, while his sharpshooters <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> were so vigilant and expert at their business that a head could hardly show itself above our earthwork without getting a ball through it. A hat put on a ramrod and raised a little would be perforated in a jiffy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>It was evident that the enemy was thus endeavoring to prevent his movements from being seen, and I felt sure that he was massing troops under the hill in the woods, with the design of charging our exposed position, and determined to risk a peep at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>I ordered the men to keep low while I cautiously raised my head, and at <num value="1">one</num> quick glance saw a heavy column of men in blue flanking towards our left, though partially concealed by the timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>At the same time I saw a puff of smoke issue from behind a big pine, perhaps <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> in my front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>I instantly ducked my head; the next <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> a minie-ball cut the dirt just behind me. Satisfied that the fellow was far enough away for me to dodge his ball by the flash of his gun, I again raised my head, took a good, long look, and saw more troops moving to the left, but another puff of smoke warned me to duck again, and again a ball cut the earth where my head had been.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I then dispatched a runner to my commanding officer to tell him what I had seen, and that our line was too weak to withstand the anticipated charge, and subsequently heard that <persName n="Finnegan,,,,," id="n0273.0005.00056.00544" reg="mostcommon:Finnegan,nomatch:0"><surname>Finnegan</surname></persName> with his Floridanians were ordered up within supporting distance in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Then calling the best riflemen in my company to me, I pointed out the place where <hi rend="italics">my</hi> enemy stood behind the tree and told him to watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Soon the man's head moved cautiously around the tree, and my man fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>He disappeared instantly, and thinking he had been settled, I raised and looked in another direction, when instantly I felt a shock, like a red-hot iron had pierced my brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>I experienced a great jar, saw a <num value="1000">thousand</num> stars, and then all was blank, and I saw no more of that fight.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/><hi rend="italics">Comrades and Friends</hi>:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>The motives which prompt a reunion of surviving Confederates are felt to be laudable and honorable, and the occasion awakens a sacred and melancholy pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>There is nothing of political significance or sectional aim in such an assemblage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>It has no purpose or wish to rekindle the embers of discord, or to drag forth from the grave the dead issues of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>The receding years have happily borne us far away from the era of angry recriminations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>The snows of more than <num value="20">twenty</num> winters have fallen with cooling effect upon the heated animosities of the war, and not <num value="1">one</num> of us would seek to inflame them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>As innocent as are the gently fallen leaves of this autumn day to disturb the dreamless slumber of the men who fell in the great conflict, would we be to arouse by word or deed <num value="1">one</num> of its slumbering passions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>We meet beneath this grove&mdash;consecrated to devotion and to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>&mdash;for no unholy purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>We come to this soldiers' reunion with no disloyal scheme and no unpatriotic sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>Our meeting is in the name of fraternity, of patriotism, and of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>We are drawn hither by the ties of that manly friendship which was formed in the dark hours of trial, and indissolubly sealed in the red heat of suffering and danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>We come with the interests, the sympathies, and the stirring recollections, born of a mutual experience in the camp, on the march, and in the battle, to touch hearts together again, and with gratitude to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for our preservation, to answer once more to the roll-call before we go to answer to it in the great reunion before the bar of our Maker.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>We meet to grasp once more in life and peace the hands we were wont to grasp amidst bloody scenes of strife, and in the clear sunlight of domestic quietude to look into the faces that we used to see bronzed with the exposure of the camp or begrimed with the smoke of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>We bring together hearts that once rose and fell in mutual sympathy with the hopes and fears of a great common cause and danger, that they may beat responsively to that patriotic interest and manly friendship which bound us <num value="1">one</num> to the other as with hooks of steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>We meet to commemorate our deeds of manhood on the arena of fiery trial, and to recall the names and recount the virtues of our fallen comrades, and, I trust, to pledge here, on this sacred spot, our <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> fidelity to both through every future change and circumstance, until our hearts shall become as cold as the clay that shall wrap them in the tomb.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>We who, in the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, have been spared to the present hour, as survivors of the war, are in a position to do much to vindicate the motives and to secure historic justice for the deeds of constancy and courage of the men of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 22" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, who, on the side of the <rs>South</rs>, met that tremendous shock of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>We have emerged from the era of deeply-excited prejudices and heated passions, when the actions of our people were so readily misrepresented and their motives impugned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>The calmer feelings of the present day, and the cooler judgments of the people, are more favorable to the establishment and perpetuation of the truth as regards the motives and the achievements of men who toiled and struggled under the banners of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>In their calmer and more sober days, the facts are coming to light that will be accepted in future years as the honest verdicts of history, and the temper of the public mind, and the spirit of legislative assemblies, both State and national, make the present era specially favorable for the survivors of the struggle on either side to aid in securing for coming ages a faithful record of their names, their principles, and their deeds; as men who trod the fiery paths of danger in deference to what they honestly felt to be a patriotic duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>As regards our cause in general, we feel no apprehension that history will not ultimately vindicate the integrity of its principles and aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>The disasters which befell it, and the early overthrow to which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> and <q direct="unspecified">overwhelming numbers and resources</q> consigned it, have cast a shadow over its history, and will, for a time, obscure its principles and the grounds of its being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>There will exist honest differences of opinion as to the justness of its claims and the wisdom of its policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Let this, however, be said of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, that in the hour of its overthrow, its chief leaders pleaded in vain for a trial on the charge of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>There was no tribunal to be found that would, by solemn judicial action, brand that stigma on their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>The names made most illustrious by association with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause have commanded the profoundest respect of the civilized world, and those who opposed them in battle have vied with others in doing homage to their private worth and public virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>In the integrity and virtue of the men who upheld that cause as the pillars of its strength, and in the purity of the women who sustained it with their prayers and lamented it with their tears, let us behold the <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> innocency and truth of the cause we loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>Our <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy</placeName> has fallen, but its virtue and its purity we may maintain, even as we reverence the piety of a lost mother.</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>realm of tears, but let her bear</l> <l>This blazon to the end of time;</l> <l>No nation rose so white and fair</l> <l>None fell so pure of crime.</l></lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>With respect to the motives that actuated the men of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 22" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, who flew to arms and battled for the cause of the <rs>South</rs> in the great civil struggle, it may be claimed that posterity is not likely to misjudge them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>The names of these men will not be associated with any schemes of restless sedition, or with any designs of unrighteous political ambition, or any spirit of unholy, mercenary conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>It was for no such purposes that they left their peaceful homes to brave the dangers of the fratricidal strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Their sole aim was to protect their altars, their families, and their rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, from the perils of an armed invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>They did not seek the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>They took up arms for no aggressive war. But, when the dark clouds were gathering and the storm threatened to burst upon the land, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 22" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> sought to act the part of mediator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>She called for a congress of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>Standing on the frontier, between the embittered sections, she pleaded, with <num value="1">one</num> hand reaching northward and the other southward, that calm reason might prevail and pacific measures be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>But her pleadings were in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>The heated passions of the sections could only be allayed in a baptism of blood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>It was only when <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 22" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was called to send her own sons for the invasion of the homes of their kindred of the <rs>South</rs>; only when armed regiments were gathering to traverse her domain on this mission, that she cast in her lot with the land of her kindred in blood, in sympathy, in interest, and in political conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>Bound thus as she was to the <rs>South</rs>, it would have been no more natural for her to have joined in the bloody crusade against her, than for a mother to plunge the dagger into the heart of the child she loves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>Every man who went forth from our borders, armed for the conflict, felt that he went to defend his home, his family, his kindred, and the graves of his sires, from invasion and defamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>Above every consideration of constitutional construction and the paramount claim of the <rs>State</rs> to the allegiance of her sons, there was rooted in the hearts of our people the conviction that their families and their kindred were assailed with the mailed hand of war; that their institutions <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> and rights were threatened with armed overthrow; that all that they held most sacred in life was in danger of being trampled beneath the foot of military invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>And, in the defence of these cherished objects, they sprung to arms with all the might they possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>And now, after more than a score of years have passed, as we recall our motives and ponder over our aims in the clear, calm atmosphere of sober afterthought, now, with the larger part of our comrades, who shared our feelings, asleep in their graves beneath the soil on which we stand, and the great Searcher of Hearts looking down upon us, we may look the whole world in the face and declare that, in our sincerest convictions, men never went forth to battle with a clearer consciousness of the rectitude of their motives or a more assured confidence in the inherent righteousness of their actions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>With respect to the military leaders, whose standards we followed and whose orders we obeyed, we need cherish no misgivings as to the honorable station their names shall hold in future history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>They indeed are among</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>the few, the immortal names,</l> <l>That were not born to die.</l></lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>In the brightness of a well-earned distinction, they have been sealed to an immortality of fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>With those of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01327" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Marlborough,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01328" reg="mostcommon:Marlborough,Malplaquet,,,:1"><surname>Marlborough</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Hampden,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01329" reg="mostcommon:Hampden,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampden</surname></persName> and of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the names of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01330" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01331" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:8"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> will be forever honorably associated on the roll of the military worthies who have illustrated the public virtue and genius of the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01332" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>And as future generations shall look back through the vista of American glory on the field, among the conspicuous forms that shall pass in view shall be those of our own gallant leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>There, at the head of their dashing columns, shall float, as of yore, the plumes of <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01333" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,nomatch:0"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01334" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:2"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>; and there shall be seen <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01335" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,George,E.,,:2"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01336" reg="mostcommon:Hill,D.,H.,,:6"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>, with outstretched arms, pointing their lines onward to victory or to death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>As regards, also, the great conflicts of arms that illustrated the skill of our leaders and tried the valor of our troops, we need harbor no apprehensions that the muse of history will not in coming years accord to them adequate justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>It may, indeed, be said of the men who followed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01337" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0273.0015.00112.01338" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:8"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> in these heroic struggles, that the light of their camp fires has cast its reflection, and the thunder of their guns sent its echoes, over the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>Appreciative historians, using other languages than our own, have written for distant people the story of our marches, our sufferings, our endurance <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> and our victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>The genius of our commanders and the daring of our men have given to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> a prominence among the great battlefields of the world, from which our struggling legions in their tattered garments of gray shall never fade from the admiring gaze of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>The government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, rejoicing in the returning harmony of the once alienated and contending sections, is with liberal care placing in permanent form the official records of our battles, and in her archives, along with the reports of the <rs>Federal</rs> commanders, is sacredly preserving those that tell of the movements, the numbers, the successes and the losses of the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>My comrades, the embers of the old camp-fires were long ago extinguished; the rifle-pits, from which flew our death-dealing volleys, have been plowed over; the forts and frowning earth-works that trembled beneath the fire of our heavy guns are fast levelling down, and our comrades are <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> passing rapidly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>Ere long the last of these grim relics and the last survivor of the war will be gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>But the valor and constancy of our soldiers on the field, their rapid marches, their fierce onslaughts in battle, their unflinching firmness in the face of immense odds, their unmurmuring endurance of hardships and suffering&mdash;in a word, their splendid bearing under every circumstance that called for patriotic devotion and manly virtue&mdash;will live in the traditions and history of the nation as long as a heart survives to appreciate noble fortitude, or an eye to kindle at the recital of heroic courage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>Of the brave comrades who fell at our sides or were borne away from the field to die, it is happily true that, in most of the counties represented here to-day, their names have been sacredly gathered up and carved on granite or marble monuments, there to remain through coming years a touching illustration of fidelity to patriotic duty even unto death, and also of the loving commemoration of a grateful people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>Fellow-survivors of the great struggle, on whose altar these fallen heroes poured out their blood, it behooves us to see that the name of no humble comrade, who went out from our counties and died for our cause, is left to dumb forgetfulness and cold oblivion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>We owe it to their sacred and gallant memories that some permanent memorial shall, with mute impressiveness, tell their names and their patriotic services to those who are to come after us. Let these monumental shafts rear their graceful forms at every county seat, where fathers and sons shall gather in coming years and look upon them; and may the showers fall gently upon them and the winds of <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> Heaven fan them softly as they shall bear our dead comrades' names carved on their shining faces; and may the memory and virtues of these fallen ones be forever graven deeply on the hearts of the people!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>Of those who justly claim our reverent regard in these reunion services, we must not omit our associates who, since their return to their homes and the pursuits of peace, have followed their fallen comrades into the shades of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>How many there are who answered to the last roll-call in the army, who cannot answer to it to-day because their lips are sealed in the grave!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>Many of these were as true and faithful as any men who ever buckled on the armour or withstood the deadly hail of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>It was apparent that it would not be practicable to keep the whole force on the parapet to-night as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>The men were directed to protect themselves as well as possible by keeping near the parapet, which afforded some shelter, except against shell bursting overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>During the night it was reported that the enemy were advancing to charge our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>It was a relief to men and officers to believe that the last struggle was about to be made, and that this awful cannonade was about to be exchanged for musketry and a hand-to-hand fight with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>The enemy displayed a calcium light, and lighted up our works brilliantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>The fort was going rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>Tolerably good water was thus obtained, but not in sufficient quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>The heat was intense, and the air in the bomb-proofs became very foul and hardly supported life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>In the event of its not coming, we had resolved to hold the fort while there was a man left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>A sortie had been talked of, and would probably have been made if the general commanding had not come to the conclusion to make an effort to save the garrison, or rather to permit us to make an effort to save ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>The work could not have been held, but we were resolved to sell our lives as dearly as possible, and I have no doubt but that our resistance would have been a very honorable death struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>The sharpshooters were directed to keep up a steady fire, not so rapid as to create the impression that it was done for effect, nor yet so slow as to induce the belief that the garrison had been weakened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>The firing was more spirited than it had been during the day or on the previous night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>Fresh troops fired more rapidly than soldiers worn out by days and nights of constant service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>He was not at liberty to leave his post, and he and the companies under his command could not accompany us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>The ground over which we had been passing was of such a character that I could not have used my horse, and he had been sent in charge of a man to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/><persName n="Mazyck,,,,," id="n0273.0016.00186.01919" reg="mostcommon:Mazyck,nomatch:0"><surname>Mazyck</surname></persName> directed me to leave the railroad, turn to the left at an acute angle, and after marching about a couple of <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> further to take position in the edge of a field, our line being parallel to the railroad, with the woods about <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>The enemy had gotten possession of the railroad, and both the <num value="21" type="ordinal">Twenty first</num> and <num value="27" type="ordinal">Twenty-seventh</num> had suffered severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>As soon as we got in line in our new position we opened fire on the enemy on the railroad in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>I soon perceived that while the enemy's shots were passing through our ranks and telling on our numbers, ours were doing them no harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>The railroad cut and the embankment (where the cut left the hill and reached the lower ground) effectually protected them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>Besides this, quite a number of men belonging to the <num value="21" type="ordinal">Twenty-first</num> and <num value="27" type="ordinal">Twenty-seventh</num> were coming from the left, and passing in confusion immediately in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>I concluded, under these circumstances, that there was danger of disorder in my ranks, and that we might be swept back to the woods in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>The surest way to prevent such a disaster was to move a force towards the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>I gave the command, and the men moved forward with a yell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>There was no wavering or hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3162"/>[I was under the impression, till long afterwards, that my forward movement was without orders from General <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> <persName n="Hagood,,,,," id="n0273.0016.00187.01920" reg="mostcommon:Hagood,Johnson,,,:9"><surname>Hagood</surname></persName>, but that officer has informed me since the war that he had sent <num value="1">one</num> of his staff to bear an order to me to move, and that at the same time he ordered the <num value="21" type="ordinal">Twenty-first</num> and <num value="27" type="ordinal">Twenty seventh</num> forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>The order never reached me. Probably the officers seeing my command in motion concluded that I had anticipated the general's wishes, and that it was unnecessary to deliver the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>It was not known to me nor (do I think) to the regiment that the <num value="21" type="ordinal">Twenty-first</num> and <num value="27" type="ordinal">Twenty-seventh</num> were moving upon the enemy.] The men were somewhat exhausted by the rapid march to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>About half way from where we started in our advance we came to a ravine which afforded shelter from the enemy's bullets, then making sad havoc in our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>I ordered a halt, to enable the men to take breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>It then occurred to me that the enemy might make a counter movement and charge us from their cover in the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>I happened to be in the part of the line filled by <orgName type="company" n="Company G">Company G</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>Desiring to have a look out kept on the movements of the enemy while we rested, and knowing that such service was hazardous in the extreme, I called for volunteers to go up the banks of the ravine and watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>I had little expectation of seeing either of them alive when we again moved forward up the slope of the ravine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>I have never seen minie-balls fly thicker than the shower poured upon us from the time we commenced the forward movement till the enemy left the railroad, and when it is remembered that for a few minutes these <num value="2">two</num> men were the targets for all of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0273.0016.00187.01923" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Y.,N.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s line in our front, their heroism in exposing their lives to prevent surprise can be appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>I recommended both of them for promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>The whole command behaved as gallantly as it was possible for men to do. I know many of both officers and men deserve to be specially mentioned, but I could not observe the deeds of daring of each <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>I called on the men and officers to move forward, and if there were any who were disposed to be laggards I did not see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>Before they were seized by the fervor of battle our line was well preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>But these gallant Irishmen seemed determined to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to reach the enemy in their advantageous position on the railroad track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>The sunlight gleaming on the burnished armour of the steel-clad knights; the gay trappings of the caparisoned steeds; the standards of the chieftains unfurled to the breezes, resplendent with armorial bearings; the blare of the trumpets sounding defiance and uttering the signal of battle; the evolutions of the glittering lines; the fierce onset of the knights with lances couched and bodies bent to the pommel; the swords leaping from their scabbards and clashing on shields and helmeted heads; the terrible crash of the battle-axe&mdash;oh, it seems to me that a man must needs have been a man, with a heart that knows not how to tremble, with a frame of iron, and with sinews of steel, to engage in such warfare as that.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Pegram Battalion Association</q> have conferred upon me the proud distinction of delegating to you a valuable trust in the presentation of this register.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>As the <q direct="unspecified">Vestal Virgins</q> kept the sacred fires at the <rs type="place">Temple of Vesta</rs> at <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, so are you to keep and guard this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>Remember, it embodies the names and memories of some of our <q direct="unspecified">household gods.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>Gratefully I have accepted the duty, not that, when so many voices more eloquent than mine were easily to be had, I saw any fitness in the selection of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>Yes, <num value="1">one</num> perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3510"/>When I recall the eventful scenes of the memorable day of the battle of <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">First Manassas</rs>, let me briefly recall some of them pertinent to my subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3511"/>It was a lovely Sabbath morn, all the surroundings of Nature in perfect harmony, nothing in them to portend the coming storm; each <pb id="p.208" n="208"/> soldier as he arose in the early morn, and gazing around, could say in the language of the good old missionary hymn,</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>Every prospect pleases,</l> <l>And only man is vile.</l></lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3512"/>Nothing but the passions of man were to disturb its solemn quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>This was not long to last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>Soon the bugle-call, the tap of the drum, the strains of martial music, the tramp of heavy bodies of moving troops broke upon the stillness of the air, and gave evidence of a coming strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>With elastic step, and with the proud confidence of new troops, we marched into position; we not only thought that we were invincible, but that we could whip <q direct="unspecified">the world.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3516"/>We had read and believed&mdash;</p> <lg type="pentameter"> <l>To hearts that the spirit of Liberty flushes.</l> <l>Resistance is idle&mdash;numbers a dream!</l> <l>They burst from control, as the mountain stream rushes</l> <l>From its pillows of ice in the warmth of the beam!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/></l></lg> 
<p>Later in the day we reflected that this was pretty poetry, embodying a noble sentiment, but somehow had so far not prospered us. Many, and I among them, found ourselves a mile in rear of the position we had assumed in the early day, and with no brilliant prospect of recovering our lost ground (we did so subsequently); and I tell you from the standpoint of that day things were very doubtful; my heart, and the hearts of the stoutest, almost quailed with silent apprehension&mdash;the scales of battle so hung upon an equipoise, that a breath might disturb them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>We expected reinforcements&mdash;we hoped for them&mdash;we prayed for them&mdash;eagerly we sent for them&mdash;as <persName><foreName>Elijah</foreName></persName> of old from <placeName key="tgn,7014116;tgn,2527034" n="0.091 000000.5456	placename;tgn,7014116;mount carmel, wabash, illinois,Wabash,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2728	placename;tgn,2527034;mount carmel, wilson, tennessee,Wilson,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America" reg="mount carmel, wabash, illinois,Wabash,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;mount carmel, wilson, tennessee,Wilson,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America">Mount Carmel</placeName> sent his servant to watch for the coming cloud, even if <q direct="unspecified">no bigger than a man's hand.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>They came at a late, but most opportune hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>There dashed upon the field in gallant style a battery, at the time engaged under orders from <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,E.,," id="n0273.0017.00208.02217" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, in rallying some broken troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>I was ordered by him to guide this battery into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>I did so; but here let me pause to say a word descriptive: This battery, subsequently, but not then, a part of this military organization, had its origin and existence in the loyal heart and generous purse of <num value="1">one</num> of my oldest and best esteemed friends, then and now <num value="1">one</num> of your oldest, most valued and valuable citizens, from whom it took its name&mdash;<persName n="Purcell,,John,,," id="n0273.0017.00208.02218" reg="default:Purcell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Purcell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>It was commanded by my almost life-long friend, <persName n="Walker,,Lindsay,,," id="n0273.0017.00208.02219" reg="default:Walker,Lindsay,,,"><foreName>Lindsay</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, as gallant a soldier as <pb id="p.209" n="209"/> ever carried a gun into action, and next in command, the <q direct="unspecified">boy</q> soldier, <persName n="Pegram,,Willie,,," id="n0273.0017.00209.02220" reg="default:Pegram,Willie,,,"><foreName>Willie</foreName> <surname>Pegram</surname></persName>, whom I had known and loved from his babyhood, and who in the beginning of the war, seemed like <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Minerva,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00209.02221" reg="mostcommon:Minerva,nomatch:0"><surname>Minerva</surname></persName>,</q> to have sprung armed from the <name n="God" type="God">god</name>-king of war. I do not unsex him in the simile, for with all the manliness of any man, he had all the gentleness and tenderness of a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>As charged against <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName></persName> of old by his brethren, I could not resist, in the <q direct="unspecified">haughtiness of my heart</q>&mdash;and though temporarily absent from my own command&mdash;resting upon my horse to see this <q direct="unspecified">battle.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>Rapidly they wheeled into position; I saw the boy soldier leap from his horse, and with a comrade (I wish I could give his name) sight the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun and fire it; I saw its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot surge through the advancing column of the enemy, and then like lightning flashes, shot after shot ploughing through their ranks, like some <q direct="unspecified">cyclone of desolation</q> through a narrow valley, leaving carnage in their tracks and aiding far to produce the demoralization which resulted in the memorable panic of that day. I can never forget &mdash; I do not wish even to forget&mdash;this scene, and when I recall it I feel there may be fitness, perhaps, in my voicing them, at least, in the solemn ceremonies of this day. Called, with his equally gallant and lamented brother to distant scenes of war in the west, I only once again saw this gallant hero and <name>Christian</name> warrior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>Sad, is it not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>to think that at the early age of <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty-three years</measure>&mdash;almost a bud, but a bud which had wonderfully blossomed&mdash;he should lay down his life, a sacrifice upon the altar of his country, but not before he had given his name to this <q direct="unspecified">battalion,</q> and it and himself to history; not before he had thrice been recommended for promotion by gallant corps commanders, and with an endorsement from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0273.0017.00209.02222" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> of which any man might well be proud: <q direct="unspecified">I would approve, but I cannot spare him from my command!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>Better than promotion&mdash;better die a <hi rend="italics">colonel</hi> with this encomium, than the <hi rend="italics">generalship</hi> he had earned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>Peace to thy ashes, brave and gentle comrade and friend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>Time forbids that I mention other names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>I would love to mention them&mdash;the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Crenshaw,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00209.02223" reg="mostcommon:Crenshaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Crenshaw</surname></persName>,</q> the outcome of another loyal and brave heart from our midst&mdash;the <name>Letcher</name> and the <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> batteries, with their noble men and officers&mdash;and last, but not least, the <placeName reg="Pee Dee, Anson, North Carolina" key="tgn,2573919">Pee Dee</placeName> Battery from our gallant and plucky little sister State, <placeName key="tgn,7007712" n="1.000 42" reg="south carolina">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>We will never forget any of you, and this register enshrines your noble dead.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>But the shadows of the coming evening warn me that I must not linger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>I can only present you this record as a whole &mdash; the register <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> of names and memories to be treasured&mdash;of those, many of whom gave their lives, and all risked them, for a holy cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>To us, the survivors of the war, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as a government is dead&mdash;as our buried heroes&mdash;beyond the power of human resurrection, even if we so willed it; but, though dead, it liveth to us in its memories, so sad, yet at times so joyous, in its regrets mingled, but never remorseful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>No true heart that ever wore the gray will ever apologize for so doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>We regret nothing that we did. Our regrets are, naturally, that we failed to accomplish that for which we hoped, for which we fought, and for which these brave men died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>Our regrets are for desolated homes and hearts, for so much blood and treasure seemingly shed and expended in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>Did I say seemingly?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>Yes. The gifted and eloquent orator who has just addressed you, and whose words linger in our ears, has given you a beautiful allegory in that window&mdash;a moment since obscure and dark&mdash;now unveiled, a radiant thing of beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>So some of these days when the veil is taken from our eyes we may see and understand the <q direct="unspecified">Divine</q> wisdom which hath ordered it all. I thank him for the thought (comforting, as beautiful); and our memories, how they brighten at the remembrance of scenes, of comrades and camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>Why I can quicken the blood of these old soldiers here if I tell them of the camp, the bivouac, the march, the simple jest, the song and the buttermilk raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>Then the excitement of the battle, softened by the memory of some comrade, our <q direct="unspecified">chum,</q> who, with light heart and merry eye, called out, <q direct="unspecified">Good-bye, old fellow!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>take care of yourself till I see you again.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>He never saw us again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>We saw him a few hours later, cold and stiff, with lifeless eyes upturned to heaven; and then we remember that some of them left widows and orphans&mdash;a sacred legacy to be treasured; and comrades, many dependent in advancing years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>I thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> this home, where day by day earthly wants and comforts are supplied to these time-worn and war-scarred veterans (their earthly refuge), this sacred building, in which each recurring Sunday they may worship and listen to the words of heavenly wisdom (to prepare them for their final march and eternal encampment) speak aloud the fact that we have not forgotten to remember them, nor will our children after us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>My comrades!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>this is not a roll of the living but of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>It is not the only roll of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>There is another, of mingled staff, infantry, cavalry and artillery, of officers and privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>Upon this may be found the names of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00210.02224" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00210.02225" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,H.,M.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00210.02226" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:2"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Johnson,,Sydney,,," id="n0273.0017.00210.02227" reg="default:Johnson,Sydney,,,"><foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Zollicoffer,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00210.02228" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> and <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n0273.0017.00210.02229" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,F.,,,:2"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName> (names we have honored), and some <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> of whose memories we almost worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>Neither of these rolls are yet complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>As the years glide by other names will be added.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>Sooner or later you and I must appear before the <num value="1">one</num> or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>It may not be a pleasant thought, but it is a fact in the future, which should remind us so to live, that when we are enrolled our comrades will not be ashamed of our companionship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>And there may be <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> roll of honor of which I love to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>When the <q direct="unspecified">Mother of the <name>Gracchi</name></q> was asked for her jewels, she pointed to her sons; when the sons of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> were asked for their jewels, little of diamonds, pearls, sapphires, <rs type="color">silver</rs> or <rs type="color">gold</rs>, could they show from the wreck, but with proud confidence they could point to the mothers, wives, daughters, sisters and sweethearts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, more precious than all the crown-jewels of the combined kingdoms of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>If the men fought the battles, who encouraged; nay, armed and uniformed them for the fray?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>Who toiled for them, suffered and wept for them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>Who nursed them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>Go to the bed-side of yonder soldier-boy, far from home and loved ones, fever-tossed, or with suffering wound, talk to him of diamonds, and he will turn his face to the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>What interest has he in them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>But let him but hear the gentle voice, or feel the soothing hand of the ministering angel standing by his hospital cot, he will turn his softened glance, and say of diamonds&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>We were brethren before the war (it was an internecine war), we are brethren again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>There were not desolated homes with them, because the scene of war was confined <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> to us, but there were desolated and anguish torn hearts, sad memories, vacant chairs, voids created, never again to be filled on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>We should sympathize with each other, as the brave soldier of either side felt for and gave the last drop of his canteen to a wounded or dying opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>Upon some quiet summer evening you may gaze upwards and see the tints of the blue and gray so commingled in the sky that human vision, at the immeasurable distance, fails to separate them, and may it not be a happy speculation that departed spirits of the blue and the gray&mdash;once opposed in angry contest, now in blended harmony&mdash;inhabit those airy mansions; and the spirits of our own departed comrades, where are they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>The <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>, in both branches, has had the question up, and the following speech from the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lord of the <rs>Admiralty</rs> on the subject, will be found interesting and instructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>The duke said, in reply to inquiries in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>, that&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>He was much obliged to the noble earl for having brought this subject before the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, the <name>Legislature</name> was very anxious to have the navy increased, and to augment the number of line-of-battle ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>Such was the state of things when he came into office, when he found the programme of the former government included <num value="2">two</num> iron-cased ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>So far from his not following that programme, he had found it necessary to increase the number of iron-cased ships from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="6">six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that was constructed was the <hi rend="italics">Warrior</hi>, and then the <hi rend="italics">Black Prince</hi>. He was not quite satisfied with those vessels, and he therefore called upon the <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> department to reconsider the question, with a view to a smaller kind of vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>In consequence of that, the <hi rend="italics">Defense</hi> vessels were laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>Those vessels were half the tonnage of the <hi rend="italics">Warrior</hi>. He was not quite satisfied even with those vessels, as their plates, he thought, ought to be carried further round, and then vessels of the <hi rend="italics">Resistance</hi> class were laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>All these vessels were built by contract; but it had been found impossible to build such vessels in a specific time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>With regard to the armament of the <term type="ship">vessels</term>, the <rs type="ship">Admiralty</rs>, seeing what was coming, gave orders last summer to build <num value="3">three</num> ships of upwards of <num value="6000">six thousand</num> tons each, that would carry any sized guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>They would have <num value="40">forty</num> guns each, protected all round with plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>That made <num value="10">ten</num> vessels built and building, <num value="5">five</num> of which would be afloat and effective in the course of the present year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>He had also, in the course of last year, ordered <num value="5">five</num> ships to be cut down to carry <num value="32">thirty-two</num> guns each, protected all round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>These vessels would be <measure n="4000horsepower">four thousand horse-power</measure>, <num value="5">five</num> of them would be completed this year, giving <num value="10">ten</num> <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs> completed this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>Still he did not think our ports were sufficiently defended, and therefore he ordered a cupola-vessel on <persName n="Cole,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0020.00219.02279" reg="mostcommon:Cole,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Cole</surname></persName>'s plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>The experiments that were made in that case had been attended with the most satisfactory results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>It was, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, found that the firing was much more rapid from the cupola than from the ordinary ship; and it was afterwards ascertained that the cupola has an extraordinary power of resisting any fire directed against it. The test to which it had been subjected was such as hardly any vessel would have to undergo in an action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>There had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been fired at it <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> <num value="40">40</num>-pounders, then <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> <num value="68">68</num>-pounders, and finally about <num value="4000">forty 100</num>-pounders, and yet the cupola sustained little or no injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> of its plates had been injured, and it was afterwards found that that plate was constructed of bad iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>Those experiments had been made last Autumn, but he had not thought it necessary to commence at once the construction of a vessel with a cupola; he had delayed any action in the matter until the assembling of Parliament; and in the estimates a vote was inserted for the building of such a ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>That vote has been passed, and the construction of the vessel was to be commenced in the course of a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>The length of that vessel would be about <measure n="250feet" type="distance">two hundred and fifty feet</measure>; its tonnage would be a little over <num value="2000">two thousand</num> tons, and it would not draw <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>He believed that it would be found to be a ship of a very effective description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>It was to be an entirely new vessel, but he believed that the principle of its construction might be applied to <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> some of our ships, by cutting them down for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>It was a vessel that could go all round the coast, but it had neither masts nor yards, and he felt persuaded that it would be found very effective for the protection of our shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3683"/>The Admiralty were at present constructing <num value="6">six</num> different kinds of plated vessels, but he was not quite satisfied with any of them, because the iron-plating hung heavily on all their sides without giving them the utmost conceivable amount of strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3684"/>We could cut down <num value="20">twenty</num> of our line-of-battle ships, and adapt them, with iron-plating, for coast and shallow water-service, and that change could be effected at a comparatively small cost, while we should, during these alterations, still possess a powerful fleet of about <num value="40">forty</num> vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3685"/>He believed, therefore, that if we were compelled to engage in a maritime war, in which we should have to fight with <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs>, we should be quite prepared for the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3686"/>He would next proceed to say a few words with respect to the recent sea fight in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>It had been said that that fight altered everything in maritime warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>He was not of that opinion, and he should state what he thought it left unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>He believed that it in no way changed the opinion, which all naval authorities had already held, that a timber-ship could not resist an <rs n="iron ship" type="product">iron ship</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>But it made this great difference in our case, that hitherto we had only wooden ships to encounter on distant stations, while we must henceforth be prepared to encounter iron vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>We should certainly have to meet that altered state of things: but he believed that the cost of meeting it would not be so expensive to us as many people seemed to imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>There was another point which he wished to notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>He perceived that many persons in this country had come to the conclusion that those <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs> were invulnerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>But he should say that he had arrived at a different opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>He believed that they were very far from being invulnerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>As against wooden ships they were <q direct="unspecified">invulnerable</q>; but his belief was, that when <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs> met <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs> then invulnerability would not be found so secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/>They were told that an <rs n="iron ship" type="product">iron ship</rs> could run down its opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>Now, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0273.0020.00220.02280" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi> was a vessel of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> tons, and it had run down a sailing vessel that was at anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>But he did not think that fact was conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>He believed that many of our wooden ships would have done the same thing, and it would necessarily not be so easy to run down a steamer, as such a vessel would be much better able to avoid the collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>It appeared, too, that the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0273.0020.00220.02281" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi> had been injured in that operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>He would next proceed to notice the other vessel, the <hi rend="italics">Monitor</hi>. That was a vessel of a very curious form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/><pb id="p.221" n="221"/> <persName n="Ericsson,Mister,,,," id="n0273.0020.00221.02282" reg="mostcommon:Ericsson,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ericsson</surname></persName>, if he was the author of a communication which had been attributed to him, stated that she was quite a new vessel, and that he had built her partly as an admonition to the <rs>British</rs> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>He (the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName>) was obliged to the people of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> for their admonition, and still more obliged to them for their experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>If they would only make a few more of these experiments they would save the naval authorities in this country a good deal of trouble in firing at their target at Shoeburyness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>The <hi rend="italics">Monitor</hi> appeared to be something between a raft and a diving-bell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>She was only <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> above water when the water was smooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>It was impossible to stand on her deck, and except in a calm sea her deck would be under water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>Her crew, therefore, had to live under water, and to breath through a pipe that came down through the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>She had a cupola that was plated with layers of iron of <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> of thickness over another; and it was found that such a plate was much less solid than iron of the same thickness formed of <num value="1">one</num> mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>He also learned from an account published in a Montreal paper that the <hi rend="italics">Monitor</hi>, in her voyage from New York, was very near being lost; that the waves broke over and extinguished her fires, and that but for a steamer which was employed to tow her, she must have gone down; and further, that her crew narrowly escaped suffocation during the fight; that living in such a vessel was a sort of Calcutta Blackhole existence, and that the eyes and nose of nearly every man at the guns literally shed blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/>Another important question was the nature of the armament which these vessels carried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>All the <rs>American</rs> guns were <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0273.0020.00221.02283" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, or shell guns, and every <num value="1">one</num> knew that shells were wholly ineffective against iron plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>The force, too, with which a projectile struck depended on its velocity, and it appeared that the velocity of the shells fired from the <name>Dahlgren</name>, which was a rifled gun, was only <measure n="900feet" type="distance">nine hundred feet</measure> per <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, while our <num value="68">68</num>-pounders gave a velocity of <measure n="1500feet" type="distance">fifteen hundred feet</measure> per <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>The velocity of a projectile from a smooth-bore gun, at a distance of only <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>, was much greater than that of a rifled gun, and amounted to <measure n="1700feet" type="distance">seventeen hundred feet</measure> per <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>Now his belief was, that those American vessels would not have withstood such a shock as that, and in all probability, before the lapse of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, much larger guns would be constructed and we should have to come back to smoothbore guns for firing at near objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>We should require <num value="3">three</num> classes of vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>There must be fast sailing ships as well as heavily armed vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>It was said recently, when a force was sent to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> <q direct="unspecified">Why do you not convoy the ships?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/>Why, that was like saying, <q direct="unspecified">Why do you not set a pony to catch a race-horse.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>Our heavy ships could not possibly catch up with the fleet merchantmen of the present day. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, that we should have vessels that could cruise at sea. With regard to wooden ships, he thought we ought to hold out our hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>No new line-of-battle ship of wood had been laid down since he had been in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>With regard to the vessels on <persName n="Coles,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0020.00222.02284" reg="mostcommon:Coles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Coles</surname></persName>' plan, he believed if we had many of those vessels it would make the approach to <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Rockingham, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7014275">Portsmouth harbor</placeName> almost impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>Considering, however, that forts could carry any sized guns, we ought not hastily to give up the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>[Hear, hear.] With reference to the action between the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0273.0020.00222.02285" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Monitor</hi>, he might say that it was anything but conclusive, because the <hi rend="italics">Monitor</hi> was so low in the water that the guns of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0273.0020.00222.02286" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi> could not be brought to bear on her opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>He had now, to the best of his ability, stated what the views of the <rs>Admiralty</rs> were on the subject which the noble earl had brought under the consideration of their lordships.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>You may find that I am occasionally led into the recital of facts irrelevant to the matter of inquiry, but they are concomitant facts, and serve to illustrate the statement I desire to make more fully than could be accomplished did I avoid all digression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>It is the history of a single charge that I propose to write, but no leaf in the history of any revolution bears record of a prouder heroism, a more invincible courage, than was on that day exhibited <pb id="p.225" n="225"/> along our depleted ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>I find it impossible to speak with certainty of our arrival on the field of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, or of our position at the fatal hour of encounter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3763"/>The more prominent incidents of the terrific scene are still pictured on my mind; but it is rather with the vividness of a strange, wild dream, in which much has faded from the waking memory, than as any past event of real life that I now contemplate them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>For a time the tremendous reverberations rendered it difficult for <num value="1">one</num> at a distance to determine the direction of the battle, but knowing the position it was easy to divine that, as the din became less distinct, we were steadily forcing the enemy at every point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>At the time our brigade was thrown from the serried form of the phalanx across the field which was so soon to become our battleground, it seemed the resistance of the enemy became more stubborn, the smoke became denser and darker, and curling up filled the immense sky.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>We were in ignorance of the juxtaposition of the enemy's cavalry, but anyone without risking his dexterity might have ventured to predict that the quietude of this part of the field was soon to be broken by the clash of sabres, the shout of triumph and the agonizing cry of death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>The quick eye of our stalwart leader, his rapid movements from regiment to regiment, his hurried, yet confident, tone of command, and above all his frequent anxious glances towards a certain dense oak forest <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> away, were indications sufficient of this even before the skirmishers had engaged <num value="1">one</num> another on the intermediate ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/>Soon a battery opened upon us from the enemy's line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3771"/>They managed their guns with admirable precision, and although branches of trees were rifted from their trunks and shells exploded in our very ranks, little damage was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3780"/>The enemy now appeared in a black compact line, and at a casual view appeared rather a continuation of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3781"/>The intervening ground over which we were passing was so crossed and seamed with fences and ditches as to greatly impede our progress, and the sharpshooters, concealed wherever concealment was possible, found in the moving mass of beings an excellent mark for their rifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3891"/>It is well for us to recur to the principle underlying the <rs>Confederate</rs> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>Never was a cause apparently less understood or more maligned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>The history of the world furnishes many instances of revolutions, rebellions and wars for insufficient causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>The maintenance of the claims of an individual or family to supreme authority, trivial complaints, trifling affronts, desire for aggrandizement, pride and ambition, have been prolific causes of popular uprising or national contests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>But none of these actuated our movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>It sprang from a spirit of independence, which is hereditary and part of our being; a belief in the right and a sublime determination to maintain it. If successful, it would have been pronounced right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/><hi rend="italics">Failure don't make it wrong</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>The impelling cause was far greater and more justifiable than led to the <rs>American Revolution</rs>, and the different result can't change the dictates of justice and the decision of right reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/>The spirit which has ever animated and will ever inspire the resisters of oppression, impelled the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>To judge fairly and determine justly, their action must be estimated from their standpoint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>This is the rule applied to individuals and is applicable to masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>We must transport ourselves to their situation, circumstances and surroundings, see as they saw, believe as they believed, feel as they felt, and consider the justice and reasonableness of their apprehensions from what they saw and felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>Doing this, it is discovered that the movement <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> sprang from the principle of self preservation&mdash;the mainspring of human conduct, innate in the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>For many years a bitter contest of words had been waged between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, originating in conscience and sentiment, gathering force as it progressed, and quickened into fervid zeal by union with party efforts, until it culminated in party triumph in the election of a president on a platform of hostility to an overshadowing interest of Southern society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3905"/>Then it was that apprehension of insecurity was aroused, and the momentous question arose: what should be done to secure safety and obtain protection to great interests, ramifying society and deemed to be seriously imperilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>The determination was to seek safety by withdrawing from a union, which it was thought was about to be made an engine for the destruction of our rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3907"/>There was nothing unnatural or unprecedented in this; there was no hostility to the people of the <rs>North</rs>; there was no dissatisfaction with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which had been left to us, as to them; there was no objection to the union of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; war was not desired nor sought by us, but was deprecated, and tried by every peaceful means to be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3908"/>War resulted; a long, a fierce and terrible war, waged by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for subjugation and by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> for existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3909"/>For a long time the contest seemed doubtful, but finally victory was declared for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag was furled forever, and in its folds were enclosed the hopes of <num value="1000000">millions</num> who had proudly gazed upon its stars and bars and fondly hoped that it would wave forever, an emblem of the right of self-government&mdash;the banner of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3910"/>No national standard was ever raised more justly nor rallied to by a nobler band of brave hearts; no contest was ever maintained more gallantly; choicer spirits were never sacrificed at any shrine; fairer hands never toiled for any object; sweeter voices never were heard in prayer for any effort; purer hearts were never enlisted in any cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3911"/>But still it failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3912"/>Sacrifices and prayers and efforts were, all combined, insufficient to bring final victory to our standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3913"/>Splendid battles were fought and victories won&mdash;all for naught as to the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3914"/>While recent history suggests to the thoughtful observer that the day is not distant, if not at hand, when even ardent votaries of the <rs>Union</rs> cause may well doubt if the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, with its consequences, was altogether beneficial to the cause of human progress and Republican government, the misrepresentations of current history are such that there is danger that the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, so overwhelmingly just and defensible before the tribunal of truth and impartial history, will be so covered <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> with obloquy from distortion of facts and suppression of truth as to be misjudged by posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3915"/>It devolves on the survivors of the <rs>Confederate</rs> period to preserve the truth of their history, and hand down, from generation to generation, a correct account of the impelling cause of the unfortunate struggle, in order that the cruelty of injustice to our motives shall not be added to the pangs of defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3916"/>The world has done justice to Southern valor, but the just meed of merit has not been awarded to the motives of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3917"/>If the apprehension of danger did not justify our movement, surely the anticipation of the result of subjugation, as practically illustrated in its consequences, has furnished ample vindication of the heroic effort to avert it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3918"/>What just historian of the future, with the experience of the <rs>Southern</rs> people since the war, will blame their movement for independence, if he shall grant their prescience to anticipate what has befallen them at the hands of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3919"/>Who can view the wreck and ruin around us, the subversion of society, the ascendancy of ignorance, the elevation of incompetency, the depreciation of virtue, integrity and intelligence, and the cruel exactions from industry, as exemplied in the reconstructed States, as the direct effect of the policy of the victorious government, without according the highest praise to the statesmanship which foresaw, and the valor which struggled to avert such dire calamities?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3920"/>It is a truth that the <rs>Southern</rs> movement sprang from just such anticipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3921"/>The oft-repeated charge that ambition incited the movement is false, and proceeds from ignorance or malice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3922"/>The course of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was that by many illustrated by a single individual, who seeks to avoid injury by withdrawing from an association, the continuance of which he considers to be fraught with evil to his interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3923"/>It was an exercise of the right inherent in every people to change their governmental relations when government ceases to effectuate the object of its institution..</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3924"/>Government is not itself an end. It is but a means to an end, and that is for the welfare of the people for whom it has been instituted, and, failing in this, it has no sanctity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3925"/>The doctrine of the <name>Divine</name> right of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName> and the sanctity of government in itself is an exploded fallacy of the past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3926"/>The movement of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, impelled by a sense of danger, and animated with the determination to avert it, presents <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.237" n="237"/> of the sublimest spectacles ever exhibited in the world's history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3927"/>Born to an inheritance of freedom; jealous of the glories of the <rs>Union</rs>, of which the <rs>South</rs> was so large and important a part, and to the formation of which her people had contributed so much, her sons reverenced the <rs>Constitution</rs> of their fathers and the <rs>Union</rs> it formed, and shrank with awe from the idea of being deprived of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3928"/>Proud of the historic memories of the fortitude and heroism of the men and women of the <rs>South</rs> in the <name>Revolution</name>, their descendants were full of admiration of the structure they reared; and taught to view the <rs>Constitution</rs> these patriots had made as the palladium of their rights, the <rs>Southern</rs> people clung to its plain provisions, and rendered the homage of devoted hearts to the <rs>Union</rs> it formed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3929"/>So strong was Southern devotion to the <rs>Union</rs>, that the idea of dissolving it had for a long time to be endured before it was embraced, even after thoughts of danger to the rights of the <rs>South</rs> were associated with its continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3930"/>The resources of the brightest intellects and most patriotic hearts of the statesmen of the <rs>South</rs> were exhausted in devising expedients to save the <rs>Union</rs>, by staying the march of aggression, which threatened to endanger it. The various compromise measures which for a time allayed excitement and quieted apprehension are an evidence of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3931"/>The suggestion of a dual presidency was a device of the great intellect and patriotic soul of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>'s greatest statesmen to protect the <rs>South</rs>, and yet preserve the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3932"/>The idea of nullification sprang from the same desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3933"/>The non-preparation of the <rs>Southern States</rs> for the necessities of war is an evidence of the hopeful trust of her people in fancied ability to preserve the <rs>Union</rs> and enjoy their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3934"/>If hostility to the <rs>Union</rs>, and desire to break it, were felt by the people of the <rs>South</rs>, their course was marked by inexplicable and unexampled folly, for it is part of history that no preparation whatever had been made by the <rs>South</rs> for war when it was found to be iminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3935"/>Neither military organization, nor armaments, nor provision for them, existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3936"/>The truth is, that disunion and war were a surprise to the <rs>South</rs>, and were accepted as a dire necessity to avert what seemed to be a greater evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3937"/>The charge that the <rs>Southern</rs> people were hostile to the <rs>Union</rs>, and desired to overthrow it, is a groundless calumny, falsified by their history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3938"/>Her sons were foremost in the <name>Revolutionary</name> struggle, her statesmen conspicuous in the councils of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3939"/>The banner of the <rs>Union</rs> was never unfurled on land or sea, where danger was to be encountered and death endured in her service, when Southern men did not rally around it. The brightest laurels of the wars <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> of the <name>Revolution</name>, of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, and of <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, were plucked on fields of carnage by Southern soldiers, while the whole people of the <rs>South</rs> rendered the homage of patriotic hearts to the glories of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3940"/>That it might be perpetual was the fervent wish of every Southern soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3941"/>It was in large measure the work of Southern minds and hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3942"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> itself was the offspring of Southern intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3943"/>Southern valor contributed largely to maintain it. The Constitution was, in a great degree, the work of Southern men. Southern statesmen shaped and moulded the policy of the government, and the whole <rs>South</rs> felt just pride in the triumphs of the <rs>Union</rs>, so largely their own. It was not until the mournful conviction forced itself on the great Southern soul, reluctant to accept it at last, that this <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName>, created by the conjoint efforts of <name>South</name> and <name>North</name>, was about to be employed as an engine to destroy the <rs>South</rs>, that affection and reverence for it were weakened, and a determination made to abandon the <rs>Union</rs> and <hi rend="italics">save the <rs>Constitution</rs>;</hi> and when the <rs>Union</rs> was abandoned by the <rs>Southern</rs> people, they immediately formed a union of their own, and built it upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> they had so long revered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3944"/>They thus evinced, unmistakably that Union was desirable, and that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was acceptable, and among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, thus formed, was to try to establish terms of friendship with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, thus showing that no hostility was felt to the people, or to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3945"/>A calm retrospect of the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> affords just grounds for wonder that the sectional controversy, which culminated in attempted separation and war, was not terminated in their favor by the <rs>Southern States</rs> in the day of their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3946"/>The philosophic historian of the future, who, from the lofty eminence of truth, far removed from the impure atmosphere of prejudice and hate, by the clear light of the collected facts of history, shall view the course of events in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, will discover and record the solemn truth, that a reverential love for the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs>, alike formed by our fathers, caused the people of the <rs>South</rs> to cling to the <rs>Union</rs> to their own peril, <hi rend="italics">with a fatal delay;</hi> and that when a sense of danger proved stronger than sentiment it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3947"/>It was in the power of the <rs>South</rs> to have established a separate government, and assumed the guardianship of its own peculiar interests, for years after it became manifest that this alternative or despoilment would be forced upon it. As the <rs>Southern States</rs> had borne a full part in achieving American independence, and formed the <rs>Constitution</rs> and <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> Union, their people felt a just pride in the <rs>Union</rs> to which they had contributed so much, and shrank from the abhorrent thought of abandoning it until affection was lost in the realization that danger was imminent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3948"/>Content with their institutions, and willing to allow others the full enjoyment of all their rights, the <rs>South</rs> sought not to meddle with the affairs of others, and asked only to be let alone in the quiet enjoyment of their own. But they were denied this, and continually were offended by the querulous voice of opposition to their peculiar institution and threatened with aggression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3949"/>The feeble cry, which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was uttered to unburden tender conscience, awakened by an imaginary responsibility for fancied sin committed by other people, oblivious of, or inattentive to its own, became at length the triumphant shout of a victorious host, arousing the too confiding South from its fancied security in the <rs>Union</rs> in which it was thus exposed; and then, when it was too late, was attempted what might sooner have been easily accomplished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3950"/>The Southern people had beheld with painful solicitude the growth of a sentiment hostile to their interests from small beginnings to a vast political power, which at last exhibited strength sufficient to control a Presidential election, and culminated in a party triumph, hostile to their dearest rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3951"/>What were they to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3952"/>Were they to sit still and look supinely on and take no step to avert threatened injury?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3953"/>Were they to imitate the simple, who passeth heedlessly on, and is punished; or the prudent who foreseeth the evil, and avoideth it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3954"/>The suggestion is readily and tauntingly made; they did not avoid it, but aggravated the evil they feared by the course pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3955"/>The declaration is more easily made than proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/>Who can say what would have been the result of quietly waiting the course of events?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3957"/>Has power ever been known to curb itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3958"/>Have enthusiasm and fanaticism ever placed impassable bounds to their excess?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3959"/>Would sentiment and religious fervor, quickened into zeal, and pressed into partisan service, have been contented with moderation in the exercise of official power?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3960"/>Would not the progress made and triumph gained soon have demanded greater?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3961"/>Let history answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3962"/>It is probably true that delay of action by the <rs>Southern</rs> people would have left them for a time in enjoyment of their rights; but how long, no <num value="1">one</num> can tell or plausibly conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3963"/>We might have escaped the contest, to be precipitated upon our children or theirs; but a time surely would have come when the alternative would have <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> been presented of despoilment or resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3964"/>How long it would have been postponed no <num value="1">one</num> can tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3965"/>Whether our people acted wisely in doing as they did, or would have been gainers by delay, or were culpable in loving the <rs>Union</rs> so well and deferring action so long, must forever remain unanswered because unanswerable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3966"/>All I seek to maintain is that, whether wise or unwise, the course of the <rs>South</rs> was justified by well-founded apprehensions of danger of great injury, as indicated by demonstrations apparently hostile and threatening on the part of the <rs>North</rs>; and that the indictment against the <rs>Southern</rs> people for wantonly and capriciously surrendering the ties that bind them to the <rs>Union</rs> is calumnious and unmaintainable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3967"/>The false view so often urged, that mad ambition incited prominent leaders, who misled the <rs>Southern</rs> people, is wholly groundless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3968"/>Never was the enthusiasm of the masses more nearly universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3969"/>History records no instance of greater approximation to unanimity among a people than characterized our Southern movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>True, there were differences of opinion as to what was best to be done, but the apprehension was general and the conviction universal that danger was iminent and that something must be done, in some way, to avert it. Surely the universality of the apprehension was an indication of some just ground for such widespread concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>All classes and conditions shared the feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>The non-slaveholder of the day, most generally, was found in the front rank of the advocates of action, while those who hesitated and were disposed to delay were ofttimes most largely interested in the great institution supposed to be directly imperilled by the crisis upon the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>When the mists of prejudice which now, to some extent, envelop it shall have been dispelled, and our cause shall be seen as it was by the unobstructed view of impartial history, full justice will be done to the motives of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, as has already been done to their valor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>The valor of our people compelled recognition, for it was so conspicuous, so tangible and manifest it could not but be seen, admired and acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>But motive is not thus capable at once of securing recognition, and the subjection of our motives to persistent misrepresentation has partially succeeded in obscuring from view the true impelling cause of our action; and besides this, we encountered the prejudices of the civilized world in our struggle for the maintenance of an institution which had received its condemnation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3976"/>It devolves on us, who were part of it, to vindicate the truth of our <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> history and preserve our self-respect in the same spirit in which we render true allegiance to our present government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>I will not be understood as counseling the cherishing of a feeling of bitterness to the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>Far from it. I affirm that the same principle which animated the ardent Confederate in expousing the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> will inspire his devotion to any government of which he is a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>In both cases it is love of country&mdash;an extension of the principle of self-love, born in every heart and going forth to family and country in its enlarging circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>A man loves his country, partly because it is his, partly from association, and partly from sentiment and duty in return for its benefits and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>The government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in return for justice and kindness and trust, could find no truer, braver, more attached people than the late Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3982"/>If there has been backwardness on the part of the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to accept in full the results it was because they involved a complete revolution of all their thoughts and feelings and sentiments&mdash;that their traditional ideas were shocked, their pride mortified, their sentiments offended, their sense of propriety disregarded &mdash; that their whole moral nature has been violently outraged in what they have been called to endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>No wonder they were not ready to sing paeans to the <rs>Union</rs> which called them to submit to so much that is distasteful, when they had so recently mourned the cause they loved so well and for which they had endured so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>Surely, enlightened statesmen can properly appreciate and tolerate a feeling like this!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>and can realize the truth that they who were faithful, amid the terrible troubles of war, to the cause they espoused, will in time of trial prove equally faithful to another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>It was natural, after the war had ended, by triumph on <num value="1">one</num> side and defeat and subjugation on the other, that the ecstasy of delight on the <num value="1">one</num> side should produce corresponding depression and bitterness on the other side of those chafing under defeat and goaded by the harassing taunts of the victors, as well as suffering under their inflictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>It is hard for the human mind to forget or forgive injuries, and between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> there were mutual crimination and recrimination of real or imaginary grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>Each party considered itself right and the other wrong, and had all the intensity of self-justification and condemnation of its adversary incident to such belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>The part of true wisdom and statesmanship is to accord to each a belief in the right, from its standpoint, and to do justice to <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> the impelling motives of both, and without wrangling over the no longer practical question of right, to admit the high qualities exhibited in the contest wherever found.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>I presume, if we had been in the <rs>North</rs> with the sentiments, ideas and interests incident to that position, we would have been in favor of war to maintain the <rs>Union</rs>, but being in the <rs>South</rs>, with the views, feelings, ideas and interests of that section, we yielded to them and were Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>I don't think a Northern man is to be blamed for going with the <rs>North</rs>, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>We are to a large extent creatures of education and the victims of circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>I would have been ashamed of any of my kindred if, being of the <rs>South</rs>, they had not united with the <rs>South</rs> in her heroic struggle, and am willing to accord to the people of the <rs>North</rs> the propriety of the same conduct I claim to have been right here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>It is a great misfortune that the clearing away of the smoke of the last battle of the war was not the signal for the subsidence of the passions it excited; that statesmanship did not rule and guide the councils of the victorious government, and that the idea of merely preserving the <rs>Union</rs>, which had rallied all classes at the <rs>North</rs> in support of the war to that end, did not find its fulfillment in the disbandment of armies and the resumption of the former relation of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>It is sadder still to reflect on what might have been our condition, if passion and prejudice had not exerted their baleful influence and prevented us from the wise use of our opportunities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>But it is not wise to repine, though it is a dictate of wisdom to profit by experience and adopt the salutatory suggestions of the past in our present and future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>Animated by these sentiments I cherish devotion to the memory of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, for which so many gave their lives, and which is hallowed to <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> most of us by the recollection of dear ones sacrificed in its struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>I would preserve, fresh as the flowers of spring, the recollection of all the virtues displayed in the <rs>Confederate</rs> contest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>Though a lost cause-though branded by authority of the victor as treason, and its followers as traitors, I, for <time value="1am">one am</time> not ashamed of it. My holiest memories cluster around it. No power can storm the fortress of a resolute heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>When the <rs>Confederate</rs> banner was furled, we, as Confederates, in sadness accepting the result, while weeping bitter tears of unfeigned sorrow, and experiencing the poignancy of keenest grief at the termination of our efforts and disappointment of our fond hopes, in good faith assumed allegiance to our present government, and have maintained it; but it would be hypocrisy to pretend it was by choice, as it is treason to the memory of our gallant dead to confess the heart-condemned falsehood that our cause was not just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>Our cause was just, our purpose honorable and upright, and attempted to be maintained by as noble a band as ever struck valiant blows for freedom and right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/>Falsehood cannot blacken it, malignity and calumny cannot disgrace it, misapprehension cannot dishonor it. It can never become odious until the men and women of the <rs>South</rs> forget what they owe to the memory of the gallant dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>They were patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>They loved their country and died for it. They were heroes, and displayed their heroism in gallantly striving to maintain the right.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>Is it not natural, then, that we should draw closer together while we live, and that we should sometimes meet, as we have done to-day, to recall the times when together we offered our lives and shed our blood for our State, and suffered cold and hunger and thirst and sickness for the faith in which we were reared, and for the cause which we still maintain to have been righteous&mdash;even though lost?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>For what, then did we fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>It is well, my comrades, that we who survive should take such occasions as this to tell to those who are growing up around us what were the great causes which impelled the young and the old of that time, the rich and the poor, the learned and ignorant, to take up arms and risk their lives in battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>It has been said by a great historian that <q direct="unspecified">a man who risked and lost his life for a cause he believed a just <num value="1">one</num>, though he was mistaken in so believing, is not among those whose fate deserves the most compassion, or whose career is least to be envied.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>But <hi rend="italics">we</hi> were not mistaken in the cause for which we fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>We did not fight for slavery&mdash;slavery, a burden imposed upon us by former generations of the world, a burden increased upon us by the falsely-pretended philanthropic legislation of Northern States, which legislation did not emancipate their slaves, but forced them to be sent to the <rs>South</rs> and sold here&mdash;was not the <hi rend="italics">cause</hi> of the war, but the incidents upon which the differences between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, and from <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> which differences the war was inevitable from the foundation of our government, did but turn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>That it was not slavery in itself for which we fought, is shown by the <num value="1000">thousands</num> and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of volunteers who owned no slaves, and yet who were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to hasten into our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>Take the instance of our own State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>The census of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> shows that there were but <num value="26701">26,701</num> slaveholders in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and yet she gave <num value="44000">44,000</num> volunteers during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> of the war. Supposing, then, that every slaveholder went into the service, we would have over <num value="17000">17,000</num> volunteers from the <rs>State</rs> who owned no slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>But as you and I, my comrades, well know, the slaveholders, as a class, were by no means more prompt in offering their services than those who did not own slaves; and, you recollect, there was a provision in the <rs>Conscript Act</rs> actually exempting from service those who owned and worked a certain number of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>I think we may safely assume that <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the volunteers owned no slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>I say it was not for slavery for which we fought, but that it was for the sovereignty of our State and for the supremacy of our race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>The instinct of our people felt that the <num value="1">one</num> was involved in the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>We fought for <placeName reg="State">State</placeName>'s rights and <placeName reg="State">State</placeName>'s sovereignty as a political principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>We fought for the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName>, with a loyal love that no personal sovereign has ever aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>But more, you and I, my comrades, whether owning slaves or not, could not but foresee, with the conviction of certainty, the calamities that would, that must follow, that <hi rend="italics">have</hi> followed the emancipation of the negro by the fanatical party which, by a mere minority of votes, obtained possession of the government in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>We of this generation had no part in the establishment of slavery in this country&mdash;as early as <dateStruct value="1741--"><year reg="1741">1741</year></dateStruct> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> unsuccessfully endeavored to check the importation of slaves with which the mother country was crowding the province; but we were born to the question: what was to be done with an institution which we had inherited from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which had been augmented by the casting off the slaves of the <rs>North</rs> upon the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>Northern philanthropists who had sent and sold their slaves to the <rs>South</rs> might safely, if not honestly, advocate their emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>But with us the question was not only as to the positive good or evil of the institution, but what would the negro be, and what would we do with him, and what would he do to us if freed?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>Had slavery never existed, I believe the war between the <num value="2">two</num> sections of this country was inevitable, and, as we know, had all but commenced in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct> while on the other hand its existence rendered <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> the political principle of State sovereignty more than a sentiment and a theory, and made it a practical question, essential to the <rs>South</rs>, in dealing with that institution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>We were so unfortunate as to permit the great underlying question at issue between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> to turn, apparently, <hi rend="italics">solely</hi> upon a matter on which the fanaticism of the world had been aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>But I maintain, with <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n0273.0029.00248.02357" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,A.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, that while <q direct="unspecified">slavery, so-called, that legal subordination of the black race to the white, which existed in all but <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> when the <rs>Union</rs> was formed, and in <num value="15">fifteen</num> of them when the war began, was unquestionably the occasion of the war&mdash;the main exciting proximate cause on both sides&mdash;on the <num value="1">one</num> as well as on the other, it was not the real, ultimate cause, the <hi rend="italics">casa causans</hi> of it.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>As it is so often said that whatever may have been the nice theoretical distinctions as to the forms of government, the <rs>North</rs> became in favor of a strong consolidated central government, because its interests were in manufactures and protection, while the <rs>South</rs> was <placeName reg="State">State</placeName>'s Rights in the defense of slavery, and that thus the real cause of the war was the antagonism between free labor and slave labor, I would call attention to the fact that as early as <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, a year before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> slave had been freed in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, when slavery still existed in every State in the <rs>Union</rs>, North as well as South, even then the different political theories of the government had already found for themselves more decidedly <q direct="unspecified">local habitations</q> than names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>You will at once see that if our Northern brethren had been earnest in freeing these people, in accordance with their righteous abhorrence of the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> and with their zealous love of universal freedom, they would all have been as philanthropic and disinterested as <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> with her <hi rend="italics"><num value="17">seventeen</num></hi> slaves, and would have emancipated their negroes as suddenly and more immediately than <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0273.0029.00250.02363" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> did ours by his famous proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>But such a course would have cost their citizens just the market value of their slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>What, then, could they do with these negroes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>The negroes came from a warmer climate, and could not live and thrive and be profitable with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/>It was expedient, therefore, as an economical measure, to get rid of the burden of their support, and the plan of emancipation, at a given time in the future, would accomplish the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>How? Mark you, it was the <hi rend="italics">negroes</hi> their slave traders had landed upon their shores they wished to get rid of&mdash; <hi rend="italics">not slavery</hi>. A provision of the law, then, that at a given day in the future all slaves would be free, would accomplish the purpose, because under such a law the owners of slaves did not lose the value of their slaves, but were only required by a given time to send them <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> to the <rs>South</rs> and to sell them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>This was the result of all the emancipation acts of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>The Northern people, as usual, beat us in the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>They sold their slaves to us, took our money for them, then freed them without paying for them, and then took credit for their philanthropy in freeing the negroes they had sold to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>Let us look at the conduct of our Northern brethren in another connection, and that in the worst feature with regard to slavery, and in doing so let us bear in mind that the superior morality and love of freedom in the <rs>North</rs> is supposed to have been peculiarly evinced in the suppression of this institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>If the <rs>Northern</rs> people were so zealous in freeing the negroes from slavery, had they not been as active in putting them into slavery?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>There is an old proverb, that the receiver is as bad as the thief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/>Unless history very much belies them, the righteous New Englanders, notwithstanding their pious abhorrence of slavery, have given a new reading to this old saw, <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., that the receiver is worse than the thief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4094"/>They thought it no sin to fit out ships to steal negroes to sell to Southerners, but their righteous souls were vexed at the idea that we should keep them in slavery after purchasing them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>In the remarks I submit to your Association to-night I shall attempt no abstract consideration of policies or principles, no philosophic discussion of the course and current of events, or of the effect and influence of results on the great and stirring times of our generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4616"/>The occasion would scarcely justify it, and such a line of thought would be aside from the purpose I have in view, which is to present some of the proofs of the powers of our Southerners in great emergencies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>I shall do this in plain narrative form, and without effort at rhetoric or declamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>I trust I shall not entirely exhaust your patience and forbearance in delivering this address hastily prepared amid engrossing official duties, and that you will make due allowances for its crudities and imperfections.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>The late war between the <name>States</name> destroyed a good many fallacies and delusions theretofore prevailing in regard to the qualities of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>Their capacity for the conduct of affairs, their genius for the organization and operation of large armies and fleets, their inventive talent for meeting and overcoming unexpected and great difficulties and providing for impending exigencies, and their energy and practicability had always been denied by their Northern cousins, and were not known to themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>It will be remembered that when, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> levies of <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> troops of <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men were provided at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to put down the so-called rebellion, it was currently asserted at the <rs>North</rs> that no longer enlistments would be <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> necessary, as the <q direct="unspecified">Rebel</q> forces would easily be dispersed in that time, and a peace conquered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>The result of the <rs n="First Battle of Manassas" type="battle">first battle of Manassas</rs> was a startling awakening to the folly of such a boast, and staggered the confidence, so hastily and unwisely adopted by a misapprehension of the <rs>Southern</rs> character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>On the other hand, the success of the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was, at the same time, damaging to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause by creating over-confidence, and causing the <rs>Southern</rs> people to underestimate the fighting qualities of the <rs>Northern</rs> soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>It was no uncommon thing to hear it said in the early days of the conflict that <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">one</num> Southern man could whip <num value="5">five</num> <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>,</q> inconsiderately failing to bear in mind that the <rs>Yankees</rs> were largely the same race as ourselves, and undervaluing the fact that organization and discipline will make good fighting soldiers of almost any race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>So that the war relieved <hi rend="italics">us</hi> also of many errors into which we had fallen in measuring the character of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>Assuming then, that the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of both armies were equal in courage, in fortitude, in intelligence, and in all those qualities that make good soldiers&mdash;it cannot be denied that the <rs>South</rs> was greatly at a disadvantage, in comparison with the <rs>North</rs>, in every other particular.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>In the first place, the <rs>North</rs> was largely superior in numbers&mdash;in the numbers of her own people, and unlimited in the drafts which she could make on foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>She had a thoroughly equipped, organized, regular army&mdash;organized, by the way, in its perfect staff appointments, by that greatest of war secretaries the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>She had also a navy in fighting trim, organized for prompt action, with a large merchant marine subject to her demands, all manned with trained sailors and seaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>The <rs>North</rs> had a government, complete in all its departments, in full vigor and operation, well supplied with revenue and material of war. She had workshops for the fabrication of arms, material to supply them, and the whole civilized world from which to draw whatever was best and most desirable in modern improvements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>On the other hand what had the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>She had, it is true, separate State governments, with power to enlist troops and defend their own borders, but these the <rs>North</rs> also had, in addition to her <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> other advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>There was no general government; no organized army or navy; no quartermaster, subsistence, ordnance or <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>; no vessels of war; no arms or ammunition or other war material, except such as fell into her hands with the capture or surrender of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> forts, arsenals or magazines within her borders; no levies to draw upon, except her own sons, to supply the ranks of her armies and ships, when called into being; no money, except that supplied by the <name>States</name> in their individual capacity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>I think, therefore, it may be safely claimed the <rs>North</rs> had every advantage except in the pluck and prowess and patriotism of her soldiers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/></p> 
<p>As an almost exclusively agricultural region the <rs>South</rs> had left to the <rs>North</rs> not only the manufacture of arms, powder, shot, and, in general, implements of war, but also of the necessary accessories&mdash;<rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, locomotives, cars, wagons, steam-boilers and engines, telegraph wire, carpenters' and entrenching tools, spikes and nails, chains and cordage, harness and saddles, cotton and woolen fabrics, shoes, <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs>, <rs n="chemical preparations" type="product">chemical preparations</rs> and drugs; in fine, of all the things absolutely necessary for the maintenance of an independent warfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>For this reason the <rs>South</rs> was still wanting in manufacturing establishments of all kinds when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun fired at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, gave, on the <dateStruct value="1861-04-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> the signal for the commencement of hostilities in good earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>Necessity, the mother of invention, taught the <rs>Confederates</rs>&mdash;who, by a strict blockade of all their ports, were soon to find themselves isolated from the balance of the world&mdash;to develop the rich, heretofore hardly imagined, resources of their land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>Foundries, powder mills, and other establishments for the manufacture of implements and equipments of war sprang up as if by magic; but here another difficulty was encountered, in the fact that the tide of immigration had hitherto turned almost entirely to the <rs>Eastern</rs>, Middle, and Western States, the inducement of higher wages offered by certain Southern capitalists being, in the opinion of the immigrants, more than counterbalanced by the greatly exaggerated danger of climatic diseases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>The South thus found herself, in a great measure, deprived of <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> skilful and experienced mechanics, a want that made itself sorely felt during the whole war, as the full capacity of the fine works at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, <placeName reg="Selma, Dallas, Alabama" key="tgn,2005248">Selma</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, from scarcity of workmen, could at no time be taken advantage of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>Southern engineers were compelled, in the first place, to recognize the inefficiency of the existing modes of defence, and to draw on their scientific knowledge and on their ingenuity for new ones; and secondly, the shifts to which they were reduced originating new combinations and improved methods, which, in some cases, proved to be of the highest value.</p></quote> These observations of an intelligent, well informed foreigner describes graphically and explicitly our true condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>The forts for sea-coast and harbor defence had been constructed when the largest guns in use were <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> Columbiads, so that they were wholly inadequate to resist high-power modern guns brought to bear upon them by the <rs>Federal</rs> fleets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>New modes of defence had to be improvised, and there is perhaps nothing in the history of warfare in any age that surpassed the skill and ingenuity of the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers and engineers in providing against our weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>The torpedo system of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> worked a revolution in naval warfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/>The limits of an address like this will, of course, not permit me to go into details to establish this assertion, but an examination of ail authorities, Confederate, Federal and foreign, will fully justify it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>They not only made it most effective for sea-coast and harbor defence, but terrible as an agency of attack upon hostile ships of war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> I was taken from the artillery service and appointed <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs> in the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName>, and assigned to duty as commandant of the <rs>Richmond</rs> arsenal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>Prior to that, I was <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> appointed by <persName n="Randolph,Secretary,,,," id="n0273.0034.00287.02889" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,Norman,V.,,:2"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName> president of a Board of Examiners, and, in conjunction with other officers of the board, conducted in the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> examinations for the purpose of selecting competent ordnance officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>This was an early application of the <q direct="unspecified">Civil Service System</q> to the military department.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>The arsenal in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was located near the river, below <address><street n="Cary street">Cary street</street></address>, in a number of large brick houses formerly used as tobacco manufactories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>On the island, connected by a foot-bridge, was the cartridge-house, where female employees made the cartridges then used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>It employed from <num value="1000">one thousand</num> to <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> operatives, and furnished the chief part of the ordnance supply used by the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>In the early part of the war ordnance stores were bought in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and in many instances reached their destination despite the blockaded forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>With these the troops were armed during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>After the <measure n="7Days" type="date">Seven Days</measure> battles around <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, large numbers of <name type="weapon">Enfield rifles</name> were secured from the battlefield and carried to the arsenal, repaired and issued to the troops to take the place of the old <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> rifles and smooth-bore muskets with which many were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>Subsequently the blockade became more stringent, and the supplies were becoming exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>All the arms used by the <rs>Confederates</rs> were muzzle-loaders, and it became a matter of extreme importance to furnish a supply of <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>The machines then used by us, modelled after the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> machines, failed to do the work with sufficient rapidity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>In this emergency an ingenious mechanic from <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg, Virginia</placeName>, invented and made a machine by which we were enabled in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> to make, fill and press a <num value="1000000">million</num> of caps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>But in a short time our supply of sheet copper was exhausted, and after the occupation of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> by the <rs>Union</rs> troops and the loss of our copper mines in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, we were placed in a serious dilemma.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>We had no copper&mdash;no mines&mdash;and the blockade was very stringent &mdash;it was impossible to obtain it. In this emergency, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, an officer was sent to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> by my order and with the approval of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Ordnance">Chief of Ordnance</rs>, <persName n="Gorgas,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0034.00287.02890" reg="mostcommon:Gorgas,Gen,Josiah,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName>, and directed to purchase, cut up, and ship to the <rs>Richmond</rs> arsenal all the turpentine and brandy stills he could find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>He was very efficient and successful, and with the copper of these old stills we made all the caps used by the army for the last year of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/><rs n="percussion caps" type="product">Percussion caps</rs> were filled with fulminate of mercury, made from <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> mercury and nitric acid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>The nitric acid was made at the arsenal of nitre and sulphuric acid&mdash;the nitre was made under the management of special officers from artificial nitre beds, and the sulphuric acid was made in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>There were no private manufactories, and these essential materials were all made during the war by the officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>Towards the close of the war our supply of mercury, of foreign importation, became exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>This was an extremely serious situation, as no mercury could possibly then be obtained in the limits of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>We began to experiment in substitutes, and fortunately found in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> <num value="2">two</num> chemicals, chlorate of potash and sulphuret of antimony, which, when properly combined, we found answered our purposes satisfactorily, and the battles of the last few months of the war were fought with caps filled with this novel substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>Our lead was obtained chiefly, and in the last years entirely, from the lead mines near <placeName reg="Wytheville, Wythe, Virginia" key="tgn,2115154">Wytheville, Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>The mines were worked night and day, and the lead converted into bullets as fast as received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>And the amount used, as shown by the reports, confirmed the old statement made in reference to the wars in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that for each man killed in battle his weight in lead is used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>The old regulation shrapnel shells were filled with leaden bails and sulphur; we had neither lead nor sulphur to spare and used instead iron balls and asphalt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>The <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar Works</orgName> made very superior cannon, field and siege, and when the copper was exhausted we planned a light cast-iron (<hi rend="italics">banded</hi> with wrought-iron) <num value="12">12</num>-pounder, that, in all respects, was equal to the bronze <rs>Napoleon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>But our best field guns, and in large numbers, were taken from the <rs>Federals</rs>&mdash;captured in battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>We had no private manufactories to assist, and frequently everything had to be done by the department and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>During the winter men from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0273.0034.00288.02891" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:38"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> cut the timber and shipped it to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, with which artillery carriages were made on which to mount the guns to fight the battles in the spring.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>Men followed the army and collected the hides of the slaughtered animals, with which to cover the saddle-trees made of timber cut by details from the men in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>The out-put of the army, brought from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harpers Ferry</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, was wholly inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>Our arms were of foreign importation somewhat, but mostly captured from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>At the close of the war the <rs>Richmond</rs> arsenal, the main <num value="1">one</num> in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, could not have armed <num value="5000">five thousand</num> troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>To make nitre a special bureau was organized; and on a large <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> scale, throughout the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, artificial nitre beds were early formed, and an abundant supply was furnished with which to manufacture gunpowder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>The large arsenal at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, Georgia</placeName>, under the management of <persName n="Rains,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0034.00289.02892" reg="mostcommon:Rains,Gabriel,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName>, was especially devoted to the manufacture of powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>Towards the close of the war it was making an abundant supply of very superior character, equal and superior to the best importation from foreign sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>In the explosion of the magazine by my order, on the morning of the surrender of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>&mdash;probably the last official act of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 21" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>&mdash;a large amount of this superior powder was destroyed, and its force manifested by a destruction not contemplated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>When we consider the absence of manufactories and machinery, and of skilled mechanics in the <rs>South</rs> at the beginning of the war, its successfully furnishing ordnance supplies for so large an army during the <num value="4">four</num> eventful years is a striking evidence of the wonderful energy and resources and ability of its people to overcome difficulties.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>I shall not apologize for quoting this letter at length, because it is full of interesting information, and I thank the author for his prompt response to my request, and for the valuable contribution he makes to the subject I am discussing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>His letter tells, in a brief and concise form, the story of difficulties, and the ability with which they were overcome by a devoted people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>It discloses how full of expedients the <rs>Southern</rs> people were and with what singular ingenuity and energy they put them in practice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>It would be highly instructive and interesting if I could procure, in this connection, statements in regard to the other great bureaus of the <rs>Confederate Government</rs>&mdash;the quartermaster, subsistence and medical&mdash;and lay before you what was accomplished by them, and enumerate some of the disadvantages under which the distinguished <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> heads of these bureaus labored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>They were organized without even a nucleus, and organized and put in vigorous operation after active hostilities had begun, and while armies were fighting in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>The staff corps, including the adjutant and inspector-general's and engineer departments, were equal to any in the military establishments of modern times, and although material to supply them was scarce, they were able to meet the exigencies of a stupendous destructive war in a satisfactory manner, and kept armies in the field which often defeated, by their irresistible courage and discipline, the finest armies in Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>They enabled these armies to continue an unequal struggle for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and command the admiration of the world by their dashing courage, fortitude and sacrifices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>Now, when we can look back and calmly survey the fields of our embarrassments, and dispassionately contemplate what was accomplished in the face and in spite of them, it does appear <q direct="unspecified">almost phenomenal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/></p> 
<p>Who of those trying days does not recall the shifts which the <rs>Southern</rs> people had to adopt to provide for the sick and wounded: the utilization of barks and herbs for the concoction of drugs, the preparation of appliances for hospitals and field infirmaries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>What surgeons in any age or in any war excelled the <rs>Confederate</rs> surgeons in skill, ingenuity or courage?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/>Who does not recall the sleepless and patient vigilance, the heroic fortitude and untiring tenderness of the fair Southern women in providing articles of comfort and usefulness for their kindred in the field, preparing with their dainty hands from their scanty supplies food and clothing for the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers, establishing homes and hospitals for the sick and disabled, and ministering to their wants with a gentle kindness that alleviated so much suffering and pain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>Do the annals of any country or of any period furnish higher proofs of self-sacrificing courage, self-abnegation and more steadfast devotion than was exercised by the <rs>Southern</rs> women during the whole progress of our desperate struggle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>If so, I have failed to discover it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>The suffering of the men from privations and hunger, from the wounds of battle and the sickness of camp, were mild inconveniences when compared with the anguish of soul suffered by the women at home, and yet they bore it all with surpassing heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>No pen can ever record the half of their sacrifices, and no tongue can ever do justice to their imperishable renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>The shot and shell of invading armies could not intimidate, nor could the rude presence of a sometimes ruthless enemy deter their dauntless souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/><pb id="p.291" n="291"/></p> 
<p>To my mind there has been nothing in history or past experience comparable to their fortitude, courage and devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/>Instances may be cited where the women of a country battling for its rights and liberties have sustained themselves under the hardest fate, and made great sacrifices for the cause they loved and the men they honored and respected, but I challenge comparison in any period of the world's history with the sufferings, anxieties, fidelity and firmness of the fair, delicate women of the <rs>South</rs> during the struggle for Southern independence and since its disastrous termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/>Disappointed in the failure of a cause for which they had suffered so much, baffled in the fondest hopes of an earnest patriotism, impoverished by the iron hand of relentless war, desolated in their hearts by the cruel fate of unsuccessful battle, and bereft of the tenderest ties that bound them to earth, mourning over the dismalest prospect that ever converted the happiest, fairest land to waste and desolation, consumed by anxiety and the darkest forebodings for the future they have never lowered the exalted crest of true Southern womanhood, nor pandered to a sentiment that would compromise with dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4731"/>They have found time, amid the want and anxiety of desolated homes, to keep fresh and green the graves of their dead soldiers, when thrift and comfort might have followed cringing and convenient oblivion of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4732"/>They had the courage to build monuments to their dead, and work with that beautiful faith and silent energy which makes kinship to angels, and lights up with the fire from heaven the resistless power of woman's boundless capabilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>When men have flagged and faltered, dallied with dishonor and fallen, the women of the <rs>South</rs> have rebuilt the altars of patriotism and relumed the fires of devotion to country in the hearts of halting manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>They have borne the burden of their own griefs, and vitalized the spirits and firmness of the men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4735"/>All honor, all hail to woman's matchless achievements, and thanks, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> thanks, for the grand triumph and priceless example of her devoted heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4741"/>A recent writer in <num value="1">one</num> of the periodicals of the day has graphically described the straits of the <name>Press</name> of the <rs>South</rs>, in the following language: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4742"/><cit><quote> 
<p>Side by side with the reports of battles and the records of peace commissions, congresses and legislatures, the blurred columns of the <rs>Confederate Press</rs> were wont to teem with domestic recipes for cheap dishes, directions for raising and utilizing various vegetable products, instructions for making much of little in matters pertaining to every phase of household life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4743"/>Hard by a list of dead and wounded would stand a recipe for tanning dog skins for gloves; while the paragraphs just succeeding the closing column of the description of a naval engagement off <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> were directions for the use of boneset as a substitute for quinine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4744"/>The journals of that day were printed usually upon the poorest paper, made of straw and cotton rags, and so brittle that the slightest touch mutilated it. The ink, like the paper, was of the cheapest and commonest, and left its impression, not only on the face of the sheet, but on the hands no less than on the mind of the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4745"/>Few fonts of new type found their way into the <rs>Confederacy</rs> during the war, and at the end of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> the facilities for printing had come to a low ebb. It was no uncommon thing for publishers to issue half sheets in lieu of a complete paper, with scarcely an apology to subscribers for the curtailment of their literary and news rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4746"/>It was generally understood that this happened only through stern necessity, and not from any disposition on the part of the newspaper men to give less than an equivalent for the subscription price.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4747"/>Sometimes the journal which on yesterday appeared in all the glory of a <orgName type="regiment" key="6Command">six-column</orgName> page was to-day cut down to a <orgName type="regiment" key="4Command">four-column</orgName> half sheet, or publication was suspended with the announcement that the stock of materials had been exhausted, and that as soon as the office could be replenished publication would be resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4748"/>Eagerly as the rough sheets were looked for, and closely as they were read, a diminution of matter in them, or a failure to appear, caused only passing comment or dissatisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4749"/>Men's minds were so filled with the <num value="1000">thousand</num> things that each day brought forth about them, there were so many rumors in the air, and news flew so rapidly, even without newspaper aid, as to cause them not too greatly to miss that which to-day has come to be <num value="1">one</num> of the veriest necessities <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> of American life&mdash;a daily journal full of all the doings of all the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4750"/>Sometimes even the coarse straw paper failed the publishing fraternity, when an edition was absolutely imperative, yet in such emergency the inventive talent never deserted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4751"/>It was considered a wonderful journalistic feat on the part of its publishers for <hi rend="italics">The Vicksburg Citizen</hi>, during the siege of that city, to make its appearance, when all other resources had failed, upon wall-paper.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4752"/>Publishers of books and sheet-music occupied a scarcely less helpless condition than the newspaper people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4753"/>Their sole grounds of superiority consisted in the fact that the demands upon them were not so urgent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4754"/>The girl who sang to her soldier-lover the popular songs of that time, <q direct="unspecified">Lorena,</q> <q direct="unspecified">When This Cruel War is Over,</q> <q direct="unspecified">The <orgName n="Standard Bearer" type="newspaper">Standard Bearer</orgName>,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Harp of the <rs>South</rs>,</q> which were all duly advertised <q direct="unspecified">at the retail price of <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> per sheet; the trade supplied, however, at half off, with an additional discount where <num value="100">one hundred</num> of <num value="1">one</num> piece are ordered,</q> did not experience that immediate and insistent need of the song and its music which men and women alike felt for the newspaper that would tell them where the last battle had been fought, which army had been victorious, who had been promoted, and who had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4755"/>The fateful column might contain evil or good report of some dear <num value="1">one</num>, and its coming was full of interest and apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4756"/>Yet the sheet-music, printed, like the newspapers, in the roughest style, upon the commonest paper, with now and then a caricatured lithographic likeness of some Confederate general on the title-page, continued to be sold and sung, even though its price ran from <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> to <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> per sheet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4757"/>War-songs and war-music were the order of the day, and the soldiers in the camps and the small boys in ragged jackets shouted with an equal zest, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>Some of the sentiments which found their expression under such circumstances are as imperishable as the human language, and will survive the brilliant exploits of war and outlive the glamour of military glory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4765"/>I need not advert to the perfect form of constitutional government, brought into being by Southern men, nor do more than refer to the <rs>Constitution</rs> framed by her statesmen, to prove their capacity for the conduct of affairs, and to disprove the charge that they aimed at the subversion of republican government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>In principle they are the same, but in detail they differ.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>The laws passed by the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName>, composed exclusively of Southern men, may well challenge comparison in wisdom, in simplicity, in sufficiency with the statutes of any country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>They are matters of record, and I cannot and need not do more than refer to them to illustrate how well equipped and capable Southern statesmen were for the successful conduct of constitutional government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>And I need only call attention to the messages of that illustrious man, the chief executive of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, profound in their knowledge and acquaintance with the truest science of human government, to the reports of his chief Cabinet officers, to prove how well fitted they were for the administration of a republican form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>Nor is it needful to do more than invite criticism of the opinions and decisions of the judges who adorned the <rs>Confederate</rs> courts, to demonstrate their capabilities for judicial administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/><pb id="p.295" n="295"/></p> 
<p>If I were to venture into the domain of criticism myself, I should be tempted to complain that all departments of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> hewed too closely to constitutional lines for the most efficient results in times of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>But if this be true, it only shows how devoted they were to the principles of a government restrained by constitutional limitations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/>The strategic and tactical talent of Confederate generals, their capacity to organize large armies, to discipline and supply them from scanty and constantly diminishing stores, their executive ability, their fertility in expedients; in fine, their genius for war will not, I think, be questioned by any fair-minded critic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4775"/>And the dash and <hi rend="italics">elan</hi> of the private soldier, his aptitude for arms, his powers of endurance, his audacity and pluck in battle, his tenacity, his intelligent conformity to the rigid rules of discipline, will be readily admitted by the most hypercritical observer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4776"/>Our enemies of that day, in fact, the military students of all countries, learned some valuable lessons in the art of war from Confederate soldiers, and the former turned many of them upon us, and thereby compassed our discomfiture and ultimate defeat.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>I brought up my brigade, and under the most destructive fire I ever witnessed, I threw my brigade into the outside ditch of his massive works, and my men fought the enemy across the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>The engagement had by this time fairly opened in our front, and we immediately advanced towards the firing, in a westerly direction, crossing (what I understood was) the <placeName reg="LaFayette, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,2444045">Lafayette</placeName> road just to the left of a small house on the left of the road as you approach <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and thence through the woods in front, until we reached the fence on the edge of a large corn and stubble field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>The enemy's line in front of my regiment rested on the summit of a commanding hill on the west or farther side of the field, along which ran a thickly wooded forest, and I had to encounter their fire, delivered from this advantageous position, before they were driven from it, and after they gave way I suffered considerably while passing over this hill by a fire delivered from the high ground in the woods beyond the field.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5825"/>We passed <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> pieces of artillery on this hill, which I suppose the enemy had failed to put into position before we were upon them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5827"/>Soon afterwards, hearing firing on our right, which I suppose was <persName n="Humphries,General,,,," id="n0273.0042.00378.03649" reg="mostcommon:Humphries,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Humphries</surname></persName>, we were again ordered forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5828"/>We pressed on under a <hi rend="italics">very severe</hi> infantry and artillery fire, from which my regiment suffered very heavily until we got within about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of the enemy's line posted on a strong and elevated position on (what I am informed was) <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Peavine ridge</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5829"/>Here the fire directed against my regiment was very deadly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5830"/>In the meantime, the regiment immediately on my right (and which had already obliqued much too far to the right of mine) veered still further to the right, and left a gap between us, I suppose, of at least <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>. With my right flank thus exposed, and my line terribly thinned by the galling fire that still raged in my front, and with no signs of a continued advance on my left, I found it impossible to advance farther with any advantage, and I, therefore, halted and returned the enemy's fire as effectively as I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>I directed an officer to report my surroundings to <persName n="Kershaw,General,,,," id="n0273.0042.00378.03650" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,J.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>, who sent an order to retire behind a low ridge just in front of the fence, which ran along the northern side of the field and which we had just before crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>Here the line was reformed and, seeing the importance of holding this position, I directed my men, in the lull of battle which then ensued, to bring forward the rails from the fence mentioned to make a rude breastwork just behind the crest of the ridge, where we had taken position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>Soon afterwards the enemy advanced against us, but were very handsomely repulsed by the cool and deliberate fire of our then thinned line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5834"/>An irregular fire was <pb id="p.379" n="379"/> then kept up until, at length, reinforcements came up in <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gracie,General,,,," id="n0273.0042.00379.03651" reg="mostcommon:Gracie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gracie</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which passed over my line and attacked the enemy in the position in which we had last assailed him; but, so far as I could discover, with no better success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5835"/>After these reinforcements became engaged, my regiment took no <hi rend="italics">active</hi> part in the action as, on account of my heavy losses and of the importance of holding the line then occupied in case of failure of the pending attack, I understood that I was to act on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/>The wisdom of this order was afterwards illustrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>When <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gracie,,,,," id="n0273.0042.00379.03652" reg="mostcommon:Gracie,nomatch:0"><surname>Gracie</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> failed to carry this strong position of the enemy, they retired, with other troops that had been unsuccessfully thrown against the same point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5838"/>Night was now near and the battle thus terminated in my immediate front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5840"/>And, though we did not succeed in forcing this position, the enemy eagerly availed himself of the cover of night to retreat from it. A list of casualties is herewith submitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5856"/>At <time value="3:30pm">3:30 P. M.</time>, on the evening of the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct>, the brigade was ordered forward, we occupying our natural position in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5857"/>We had advanced but a short distance when we met quite a number of men returning (command not known). Soon after a sharp fire commenced on the left of the brigade, and extended down the line to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5858"/>Up to the time we met this line, our progress had not been impeded except by a line of skirmishers and a heavy fire of grape and canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5859"/>The regiment moved up in fine style, and met and charged the enemy gallantly, driving them from their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5860"/>They then took refuge behind a house, some fencing, trees, etc. Here a desperate struggle ensued, and here it was that <persName n="Bane,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0043.00380.03667" reg="mostcommon:Bane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bane</surname></persName>, whilst gallantly discharging his duties, received a wound which compelled him to leave the field (the command consequently devolved upon <persName n="Bassett,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0043.00380.03668" reg="mostcommon:Bassett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bassett</surname></persName>).

In driving the enemy from this position the fighting was desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5861"/>As many as <num value="2">two</num> individual hand-to-hand engagements with the bayonet occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5862"/>In taking this position we forced them to desert a battery that occupied a position in front of the left of the regiment; but by this time our line becoming deranged, we fell back some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in the timber, reformed the regiment, moved up and held position a short distance in front of the house until recalled by order about sunset.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5863"/>On the following day, about noon, we again moved forward in the same position in line we had occupied the day previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5864"/>We moved immediately in rear of another line, and consequently had gone a considerable distance before we received a heavy fire except from the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5865"/>On arriving at a field about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> from where <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> the advance commenced, the enemy appeared on our right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5866"/>This made it essential that our direction should be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5867"/>This was done on the move by making a wheel to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5868"/>We moved direct against their position, which was a very strong <num value="1">one</num>, they occupying an eminence covered with heavy timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5869"/>On our gaining the height they deserted it. After holding the position a short time the line on our left gave way, crying out <q direct="unspecified">they were flanked,</q> and consequently we fell back across the field, and reformed in the timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5870"/>In crossing this field the gallant and highly esteemed <persName n="Billingsley,Captain,Joseph,,," id="n0273.0043.00381.03672" reg="default:Billingsley,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName n="Joseph">Jo.</foreName> <surname>Billingsley</surname></persName> fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5871"/>Several other gallant men fell in this fight, and a number of men and officers were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5872"/>After our line was reformed a temporary breastwork was constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5873"/>We were here exposed to a heavy fire from the enemy's artillery; and here it was that <persName n="Bassett,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0043.00381.03673" reg="mostcommon:Bassett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bassett</surname></persName>, who had ably and gallantly commanded the regiment since the wounding of <persName n="Bane,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0043.00381.03674" reg="mostcommon:Bane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bane</surname></persName>, received a severe wound by a fragment of shell, which deprived us of his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5875"/>I cannot close without adding my testimony to the gallant bearing of both men and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5883"/>They delivered but <num value="1">one</num> volley, and fell back across the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5884"/>The regiment pressed them and urged them into a field, across which they fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5885"/>The enemy up to this time were in possession of this entire field; but where the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName> engaged them, the woods extended much farther out in the direction of the enemy than it did upon our immediate right or left, and we were thus covered by the timber in our advance some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> further forward than our friends on our flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5886"/>Our numbers being thus hid from the view of the enemy, the impression prevailed among them, both upon the right and left of us, that they were flanked, and after delivering a feeble fire into our flanks they fled across the field to the cover of the woods beyond, and it was with the greatest difficulty that our men could be held back from their pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5887"/>After a time <persName n="Rogers,Major,,,," id="n0273.0044.00382.03682" reg="nearbymention:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, assisted by <persName n="Cleveland,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0044.00382.03683" reg="nearbymention:Cleveland,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName>, succeeded in getting the regiment in line on the side of a ravine running near and parallel to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5888"/>Here we remained for <num value="1">one</num> hour or more, the enemy giving us occasional volleys from their small arms, and throwing over us charge upon charge of grape and canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5889"/>We held them in check, preventing any forward movement in our immediate front or flanks, and we thus remained until ordered to fall back, <persName n="Rogers,Major,,,," id="n0273.0044.00382.03684" reg="nearbymention:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName> having sent repeatedly in the meantime to notify our friends upon our left of our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5890"/>After falling back some <measure n="250yards" type="distance">two hundred and fifty yards</measure> we were halted, and in a short time the enemy advanced and showed themselves about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> off. <persName n="Rogers,Major,,,," id="n0273.0044.00382.03685" reg="nearbymention:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName> ordered us to charge, and we threw ourselves upon them at a run, the enemy falling back in great disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5891"/>The men followed the fleeing enemy to a ravine in the field, the brave <persName n="Rogers,Major,,,," id="n0273.0044.00382.03686" reg="nearbymention:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName> all the time urging them forward, until he saw that our friends had failed to come up upon our right and left, when the order was reluctantly given to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5892"/>We were here exposed in going in and returning to an incessant shower of grape and canister from a battery on the opposite side of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5893"/>It was in falling back from this field to our original position that the gallant <persName n="Rogers,Major,,,," id="n0273.0044.00382.03687" reg="nearbymention:Rogers,J.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName> fell from a severe wound, and the regiment is thus deprived for a time of the services of <num value="1">one</num> of its best officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5894"/>In this last charge the regiment sustained <pb id="p.383" n="383"/> its greatest loss in men and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5896"/>This was about <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time>, and we were ordered back some <measure n="150yards" type="distance">hundred and fifty yards</measure>, where we lay in line of battle until the next <time>morning</time>, <dateStruct value="1863-09-20"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="20">20th</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5897"/>At daylight on this morning (<num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>) we were aroused and remained drawn up in line for some time, when we were moved by the right flank about half a mile, where we were held in line of battle until about <time value="10am">10 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5898"/>We remained thus until about <time value="11am">11 o'clock A. M.</time>, a spirited fire being kept up upon our right and left, when we were ordered up and forward, there being, as we were told, <num value="2">two</num> lines of battle (Confederate) in front.

We were moved forward in quick time across a wooded flat, and before we gained the hill beyond the enemy hailed down upon us a perfect shower of shot and shell; but we pressed forward and, just after crossing a small field, we found the enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of breastwork, but we encountered no <num value="1">one</num> here, the enemy having fled precipitately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5900"/>About <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> further on we crossed the <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> road, and, on entering a thicket beyond, we were hid for a time from the rest of the brigade, and here an order came from our right to fall back, and <persName n="Cleveland,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0044.00383.03692" reg="nearbymention:Cleveland,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName>, supposing it was a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs>, commanded us to fall back, and the regiment dropped back about a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, but, failing to see that our left had done so, he halted us, and had just got us in line, when an order came from <persName n="Robertson,General,,,," id="n0273.0044.00383.03693" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,Anna,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> for the regiment to press forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5901"/>The regiment soon pressed forward, and by the time we had entered the field beyond the road before mentioned, the balance of the brigade, assisted by a portion of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, had run over and captured a battery on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5902"/>We were advancing rapidly across this field to rejoin our brigade when we received a fire into our right flank, the enemy being in the woods to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5903"/>The regiment immediately made a right half wheel, and fired a volley which proved so fatal that they scattered and fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5905"/>When <persName n="Cleveland,Captain,,,," id="n0273.0044.00384.03695" reg="nearbymention:Cleveland,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName> moved off to join the brigade, he left me and some <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> officers and men to hold in check the enemy that were then making their appearance in this quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5906"/>This we did, and, at the same time, drove a body from their breastworks near by, causing them to set fire to them and their knapsacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5907"/>We here took several prisoners, and <num value="3">three</num> pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5978"/>During the whole day there was heavy skirmishing in front and considerable cannonading from our batteries, the effort being to carry a high hill on the left of the road, and just to the southwest of <placeName><persName n="Armstrong,Mister,M.,M.,," id="n0273.0046.00389.03728" reg="default:Armstrong,M.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Armstrong</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5980"/>I was told that the line of these works was indicated by <num value="2">two</num> cedar trees on the top of the hill, and I directed my men not to stop short of these trees, but not to go beyond them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5981"/>We then advanced in excellent condition, under heavy fire, until we reached the cedars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5982"/>But perceiving that the trees were short of the works, I urged my men forward by every means in my power, but perhaps because of the general direction, <q direct="unspecified">not to go beyond the cedars,</q> and on account of having once halted and the difficulty of renewing the advance under such a terrible fire, there was some hesitation, which was further increased by the regiments on my right failing to come up in time on account of natural obstacles encountered in their advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5983"/>At length the left of the regiment reached the breastworks, when cries of <q direct="unspecified">we surrender</q> issued from their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5984"/>I ceased firing and went forward to receive the surrender, but, upon being fired on, I immediately renewed the firing and soon took possession of their works, after killing about <num value="17">seventeen</num> of their men and taking several prisoners, a few of whom were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5985"/>It is but truth to state that this was the most desperate encounter in which my command was ever engaged, and as it was perhaps <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant charges of the war, I cannot speak too highly of the conduct of my comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5986"/>In reference to the alleged bad faith of the enemy in pretending to surrender, it is a charitable construction, and perhaps not an unreasonable <num value="1">one</num>, to suppose that they did not understand each other, rather than that they intended to deceive.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5987"/>A list of casualties from this assault is herewith submitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>After the line commenced on our left to retreat, we remained in position until <orgName n="division"><persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00391.03740" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,W.,B.,,:3"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> had all fallen back and in great disorder, and the brigades of our own division following suit up to ours, which was the extreme right of <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00391.03741" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,J.,B.,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>; and then, with no troops for a considerable distance on our right and the field to the left a mass of fugitives, <persName n="Sims,Colonel,,,," id="n0273.0047.00391.03742" reg="mostcommon:Sims,J.,Marion,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Sims</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 21">Twenty-first regiment</orgName>, at this time in command of the brigade, consulted me and we both deemed it prudent to withdraw the brigade, which was done under fire and in reasonable order, for <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half mile</measure>, or about that distance, when the brigade was halted on the brow of a hill and formed by him on a stone fence fronting to the enemy, and all the regiments in their places.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>I passed up and down the whole length of my brigade, seeking to inspire among my men a confidence of holding them in check and of repairing the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>About an hour after we had halted, <persName n="Ramseur,General,,,," id="n0273.0047.00391.03745" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ramseur</surname></persName> rode up to me and asked if I thought I could hold my men in their position until night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>I answered I could, I thought, if my ammunition did not fail, and that I had sent several couriers to the rear for the same and none had returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>He proposed to send some of his, and turned to ride to his command, and, as I afterwards learned, was mortally wounded before he rode <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> from the right of my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>His men soon gave way, and the enemy pressing upon the disordered line on our left, they retreated in the utmost confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>I gave the order for my brigade to retreat, and designated a piece of woods as a point for the regiments to rally, but before the retreat was advanced <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> the men began to break into squads and hurried away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6013"/>All efforts to pursue order now became useless, and in a few moments the organization of the brigade was gone; myself and staff were on foot, and I had been wounded twice (slightly) in the arm and once in the foot, and from the latter I was suffering a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/>I attempted to form a skirmish line of a few scattering men that still remained with me, and partially succeeded in presenting some show of resistance until I <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> reached the hill overlooking the creek, and I then halted with the squad, placing them in some Federal breastworks, hoping and believing that there had been enough men rallied and formed, or would be, to prevent the enemy from crossing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>I had been here but a few moments when an officer, riding rapidly from the left towards the bridge, informed me that I had better leave unless I wished myself and men captured, as the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry had crossed the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>I then ordered those who had stood by me to the last (about <num value="40">forty</num> men) to get away the best they could, and leaning upon the arm of a faithful soldier (<persName n="Bass,Private,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03746" reg="mostcommon:Bass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Private">private</roleName> <surname>Bass</surname></persName>) of my own regiment, I hobbled off the field thoroughly disheartened, crossed the bridge under the fire of the advancing infantry and passed in <placeName><distance reg="20yards">twenty yards</distance> of the <rs>Federal</rs></placeName> cavalry, who were hurrahing over our captured artillery, and made the best of my way through the rapidly and, to me, most welcomely approaching night by a circuitous route to <placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's Hill</placeName>, having picked up upon the road almost half of what was left of my brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>I do not know the strength of my brigade when it entered the fight, but I don't think it could have much exceeded <num value="500">five hundred</num>; my regiment I know went under fire that morning with <num value="92">ninety-two</num> muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>I am also fully satisfied that when the brigade was formed behind the stone fence referred to, after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> retreat, that it contained as many men as <persName n="Ramseur,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03747" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><surname>Ramseur</surname></persName>'s whole division (I think my brigade at this time contained <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> men), and the crumbling ashes of the gallant dead of my own brigade who fell behind this wall, bravely defending their country, their liberty and their flag, will not permit me to remain silent when opportunity offers to controvert the report of <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03748" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,A.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, which, as well as I remember, says that <orgName n="division"><persName n="Ramseur,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03749" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><surname>Ramseur</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> and some scattering men of <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03750" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,J.,B.,,:1"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>'s were all that halted after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> retreat and attempted to retrieve the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>As to the amount of straggling in the morning, referred to by him, I can only say in regard to my own regiment that upon the retreat that evening there was from its ranks less straggling than I ever saw before in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>I don't pretend to deny but that the last scene was a disgraceful <num value="1">one</num>, but <q direct="unspecified">render unto <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03751" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,Julius,,,:3"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> the things that are <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0273.0047.00392.03752" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,Julius,,,:3"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>'s.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6402"/>The committee are dissatisfied with the motto on the seal proposed by the <rs type="place">House</rs> resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6403"/>The motto proposed is as follows: <foreign lang="la">Deo Duce Vincemus</foreign>&mdash;(Under the leadership of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> we will conquer).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6404"/>The word <foreign lang="la">duce</foreign> is too pagan in its signification, and is degrading to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, because it reduces him to the leader of an army; for scarcely does the word <foreign lang="la">duce</foreign> escape the lips before the imagination suggests <hi rend="italics"><quote>exercitus,</quote> </hi> an army for a leader to command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6405"/>It degrades the <rs>Christian</rs> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to the level of pagan gods, goddesses and heroes, as is manifest from the following quotation; <foreign lang="la">Nil desperandum Tenero duce.</foreign> This word <foreign lang="la">duce</foreign> is particularly objectionable because of its connection with the word <foreign lang="la">vincemus</foreign>&mdash;(we will conquer). This connection makes <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the leader of a physical army, by means of which we <hi rend="italics">will</hi> conquer, or must conquer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6406"/>If <name n="God" type="God">God</name> be our leader we must conquer, or he would not be the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>, and of <persName><foreName>Isaac</foreName></persName>, and of <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName>, nor the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of the <rs>Christian</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6408"/>The word <foreign lang="la">vincemus</foreign> is equally objectionable because it implies that war is to be our normal state; besides, it is in the future tense &mdash; <quote>we will conquer.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6409"/>The future is always uncertain, and ,therefore, it implies doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6410"/>What becomes of our motto when we <hi rend="italics">shall have</hi> conquered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6411"/>The future becomes an accomplished fact, and our motto thus loses its significance.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6413"/>As to the motto proposed by us, we concur with the <rs type="place">House</rs> in accepting the word <foreign lang="la"><persName n="Deo,,,,," id="n0273.0049.00421.04074" reg="mostcommon:Deo,nomatch:0"><surname>Deo</surname></persName></foreign>&mdash;<name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6417"/>Having discarded the word <quote>duce,</quote> the committee endeavored to select in lieu of it a word more in consonance with the attributes of the <name>Deity</name>, and therefore more imposing and significant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6418"/>They think success has crowned their efforts in the selection of the word <quote>vindex,</quote> which signifies an assenter, a defender, protector, deliverer, liberator, a mediator and a ruler or guardian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6422"/>What word can be suggested of more power, and so replete with sentiments and thoughts consonant with our idea of the omnipotence and justice of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6423"/>At this point the committee hesitated whether it were necessary to add anything further to the motto <quote><persName n="Deo,,,,," id="n0273.0049.00421.04076" reg="mostcommon:Deo,nomatch:0"><surname>Deo</surname></persName> vindice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6424"/>These words alone were sufficient and impressive, and, in the spirit of the lapidary style of composition, were elliptical and left much to the play of the imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6425"/>Reflection, however, induced us to add the words <quote>majores aemulamur,</quote> because without them there would be nothing in the motto referring to the equestrian figure of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0273.0049.00421.04077" reg="mostcommon:Washington,William,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>It was thought better to insert something elucidative or adaptive of the idea to be conveyed by that figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6427"/>Having determined on this point, the committee submitted to the judgment of the <name>Senate</name> the words <quote>majores aemulamur,</quote> as best adapted to express the ideas of <quote>our ancestors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6428"/><q direct="unspecified">Patres</q> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suggested, but abandoned because <pb id="p.422" n="422"/> <q direct="unspecified">majores</q> signifies ancestors absolutely, and is also more suggestive than <quote>patres.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/>The latter is a term applied to our immediate progenitors who may be alive, whereas <q direct="unspecified">majores</q> conveys the idea of a more remote generation that has passed away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/>That being disposed of, the question arose as to the proper signification of the word <quote>aemulamur.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/>Honorable emulation is the primary signification of the word; in its secondary sense it is true it includes the idea of improper rivalry, or jealousy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>But it is used in its primary and honorable sense by the most approved authors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6433"/>The secondary and improper sense of the <hi rend="italics">aemulari</hi> is excluded in the proposed motto by the relation it hears to <quote><persName n="Deo,,,,," id="n0273.0049.00422.04078" reg="mostcommon:Deo,nomatch:0"><surname>Deo</surname></persName> vindice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/>This relation excludes the idea of envy or jealousy, because <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, as the asserter of what is right, justifies the emulation, and as a punisher of what is wrong checks excess in case the emulation runs into improper envy or jealousy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6435"/>In adopting the equestrian figure of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0273.0049.00422.04079" reg="mostcommon:Washington,William,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, the committee desires distinctly to disavow any recognition of the embodiment of the idea of the <quote>cavalier.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6436"/>We have no admiration for the character of the cavalier of <dateStruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></dateStruct> any more than for his opponent, the <rs>Puritan</rs>.
