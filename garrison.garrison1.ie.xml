<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>The custom of <q direct="unspecified">company-treating,</q> as the furnishing of liquor to the militia on training days was called, was then universal, and scenes of drunkenness and debauchery were naturally the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>It is proper, therefore, at the commencement of our enterprise, that we should explain the motives by which we are actuated, the objects which we shall pursue, and the principles upon which we base our faith.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>This shall be done briefly&mdash;for <num value="1">one</num> article in our creed is, that practice is better than profession, and the fulfilment of a promise worth more than the contract itself;&mdash;hence we have issued no prospectus, nor solicited a single subscription, nor made any provision for an extensive support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>Our paper shall be sustained by its merits, or it shall perish, even though the sympathy of friendship should open its coffers for our relief; and therefore we choose, in looking to the people of this county for encouragement, to place this sheet in their hands before we ask them to subscribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>Our terms and our pretensions are before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/><pb id="p.103" n="103"/></p> 
<p>In the first place, the <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi> shall be independent, in the broadest and stoutest signification of the term; it shall be trammelled by no interest, biassed by no sect, awed by no power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Of all diminutive objects that creep on the face of the earth, that bask in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sunshine, or inhale the rich atmosphere of life&mdash;of all despicable and degraded beings, a time-serving, shuffling, truckling editor has no parallel; and he who has not courage enough to hunt down popular vices, to combat popular prejudices, to encounter the madness of party, to tell the truth and maintain the truth, cost what it may, to attack villainy in its higher walks, and strip presumption of its vulgar garb, to meet the frowns of the enemy with the smiles of a friend, and the hazard of independence with the hope of reward, should be crushed at a blow if he dared to tamper with the interests, or speculate upon the whims of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>Look at our motto&mdash;watch us narrowly in our future course&mdash;and if we depart <num value="1">one</num> tittle from the lofty sentiment which we have adopted as our guide, leave us to a speedy annihilation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>Secondly. We have <num value="3">three</num> objects in view, which we shall pursue through life, whether in this place or elsewhere&mdash; namely, the suppression of intemperance and its associate vices, the gradual emancipation of every slave in the republic, and the perpetuity of national peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>In discussing these topics, what is wanting in vigor shall be made up in zeal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>Thirdly. Education will be another prominent object of our attention; not that kind, however, which is found in our colleges alone&mdash;not the tinsel, the frippery, and the incumbrance of classical learning, so called&mdash;but a popular, practical education, which will make science familiar to the mechanic, and the arts of easy attainment, and which will best promote public virtue by the extension of general knowledge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>Fourthly. The encouragement of national industry will form another of our purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>We are friends, even to enthusiasm, to what is significantly styled the <q direct="unspecified">American System.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>We wish to see a manufactory by the side of every suitable stream, and, if possible, the entire amount of cotton that may be grown in the country made into good, substantial fabrics for home consumption and exportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>Every day's experience teaches this whole people that their interests are best promoted by the erection of <hi rend="italics">national houses of industry;</hi> that <placeName key="tgn,7013952" n="1.000 6" reg="providence, providence, rhode island">Providence</placeName> has made them necessarily dependent on no other country for the comforts of life; and that the great secret of national aggrandizement <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> consists in improving their natural advantages, and exploring their own resources.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>Finally. We have started the <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi> with the conviction that, to be well and permanently supported, it need only <hi rend="italics">merit</hi> support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>We are satisfied, moreover, that the public voice is nearly unanimous in favor of this establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>This county has probably a population of <hi rend="italics"><num value="20000">twenty thousand</num></hi>,&mdash;nineteentwen-tieths of whom are friendly to the reelection of <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0196.0005.00104.00656" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>; but their confidence has been abused, their views misrepresented, their feelings insulted; they have had no organ through which to express their desires, or hold communications with other sections of the country; they have been upbraided with apostasy, with treachery, with insincerity; and they have in their meekness borne till endurance has passed its bounds, and the pen of the slanderer become intolerable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>Be ours the task, not to rake open the smouldering embers of party, but to extinguish them; not to nourish animosities, but to encourage the growth of liberal principles; not to fight with the shadows of things which are dead, but with existing evils of national magnitude; not to give sound for sense, or <hi rend="italics">roaring</hi> for argument; not to inflame, but to heal; not to swagger and brag about our exclusive patriotism, but to enlarge the number of patriots; not to divide the community, but to unite all hearts. </p><closer><signed><persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0196.0005.00104.00657" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName>  <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, Editor.</signed> <signed><persName n="Hull,,Henry,S.,," id="n0196.0005.00104.00658" reg="default:Hull,Henry,S.,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Hull</surname></persName>, Proprietor.</signed></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>That no justificative plea for the perpetuity of slavery can be found in the condition of its victims; and no barrier against our righteous interference, in the laws which authorize the buying, selling and possessing of slaves, nor in the hazard of a collision with slaveholders.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>This sort of patriotism is common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>I suspect the reality, and deny the productiveness, of that piety which confines its operations to a particular spot&mdash;if that spot be less than the whole earth; nor scoops out, in every direction, new channels for the waters of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>The proof, then, is found in the fact, that a very large proportion of our colored population were born on our soil, and are therefore entitled to all the privileges of American citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>This is their country by birth, not by adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>This exposition must be made briefly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, in regard to the plan of the <orgName n="American Colonization Society" type="society">American Colonization Society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>No man contemplates with more intense interest and unmingled satisfaction the colony at <placeName key="tgn,1000171" n="1.000 3" reg="liberia,africa">Liberia</placeName> than the subscriber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>I have elsewhere termed it the lungs and heart of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, full of generous respiration and warm blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>But the work of colonization is exceedingly dilatory and uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>It can never entirely relieve the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>It may pluck a few leaves from the <rs>Bohon Upas</rs>, but can neither extract its roots nor destroy its withering properties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Viewed as an auxiliary, it deserves encouragement; but as a remedy, it is altogether inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>I wish to see its funds as exhaustless as the number of applicants for removal, and the fruits of its enterprise yet more abundant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>I fear, however, that a majority of the people place too much reliance upon the ability of this Society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>Many are lulling <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> themselves into a belief that the monster has received his mortal wound, and they scarcely feel any interest to be in at the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>The crafty advocates of slavery rejoice at this delusion, for they can now repose in comparative security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>For my own part, I do not believe that the removal of the great body of the blacks can be effected by voluntary contributions or individual sacrifices; and if we depend alone upon the efforts of colonization societies, slavery will never be exterminated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>As a home for emancipated slaves, I view the republic of Hayti with a favourable eye. In many points it is superior to <placeName key="tgn,1000171" n="1.000 3" reg="liberia,africa">Liberia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>Its climate is more salubrious, its government is stable, its locality is near, and transportation can be effected more cheaply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>Emigrants are received with cordial affection, and allowed extraordinary privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>Our free coloured people, moreover, generally cherish less repugnance to Hayti than to <placeName key="tgn,1000171" n="1.000 3" reg="liberia,africa">Liberia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>But while I would encourage every feasible plan for the reduction of this part of our population, I shall rely on nothing but the eternal principles of justice for the speedy overthrow of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>Since the delivery of my address in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, relative to this subject, I am convinced, on mature reflection, that no valid excuse can be given for the continuance of the evil a single hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>These, therefore, are my positions:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/><num value="1">1</num>. That the slaves are entitled to immediate and complete emancipation: consequently, to hold them longer in bondage is both tyrannical and unnecessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/><num value="2">2</num>. That the question of expediency has nothing to do with that of right, and it is not for those who tyrannise to say when they may safely break the chains of their subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>As well may a thief determine on what particular day or month he shall leave off stealing, with safety to his own interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/><num value="3">3</num>. That, on the ground of expediency, it would be wiser to set all the slaves free to-day than to-morrow&mdash;or next week than next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>To think of removing them all out of the land is visionary: not <num value="2">two</num>-fiftieths of the annual increase are taken away during the same period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>Hence the sooner they receive the benefits of instruction, the better for them and us. We can educate <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of slaves, now, with more facility and success than <num value="4000000">four millions</num> at the expiration of <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>. Give them liberation, and every inducement to revolt is removed; give them employment as free labourers, and their industry will be more productive and beneficial than mines of gold; give them religious and secular instruction, restrict them <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> with suitable regulations, and they will make peaceable citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/><num value="1000000">One million</num> of degraded slaves are more dangerous to the welfare of the country than would be <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of degraded freemen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/><num value="4">4</num>. That, as a very large proportion of our colored population were born on American soil, they are at liberty to choose their own dwelling-place, and we possess no right to use coercive measures in their removal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>Cherishing these views, therefore, I shall give no quarter to the open advocates of slavery, nor easily excuse those pseudophilanthropists who find an apology for its continuance in the condition of the slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>It would give me pleasure, in concluding these remarks, to pass an elaborate eulogium upon the zealous and amiable philanthropist with whom I am associated; but, for obvious reasons, I forbear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>Elsewhere I have not hesitated to bear testimony to his worth, and witnesses thereto are multiplying in every quarter.

Slaveholders were warned that they could not escape perdition for their sins, if they failed to repent and release their captives. The book, written from the extreme orthodox standpoint, bore evidence on every page of the vigor and earnestness of the writer, though he weakened it by an Appendix, in which he assented that the blacks should be kept under a certain tutelage for a time after emancipation, subject to patrols, obliged to bear passes, etc. It seems strange that so masterly an argument should have fallen dead, making no stir or impression, and being consigned to a speedy oblivion, in which it remained until discovered and reprinted in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> by the <orgName n="American Anti Slavery Society" type="society">American Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>; but the writer had the disadvantage of publishing his work in an obscure town and a remote State, where he had no facilities for forcing it upon the attention of the country at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>Your encomiums I receive with pleasure and humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>The esteem of a good man is always worth possessing; but to him who stands comparatively alone in the world&mdash;fatherless, motherless, without wealth, and unassisted by the influence of relatives&mdash;and who has just passed the vestibule of manhood, it is invaluable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>respected and benevolent sir: At the request of my Counsel, and at the desire of my friend <persName n="Lundy,,,,," id="n0196.0007.00192.01203" reg="nearbymention:Lundy,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Lundy</surname></persName>, I visited <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014220" n="1.000 4" reg="newburyport, essex, massachusetts">Newburyport</placeName> a few weeks since, in order to get some essential evidence to be used in the civil action which is now pending against me in this city; and also to see whether anything could be done towards renewing, and permanently establishing, the weekly publication of the <hi rend="italics">Genius</hi>. I left <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> without adequate means to carry me home, relying upon <placeName key="tgn,7013952" n="1.000 6" reg="providence, providence, rhode island">Providence</placeName> to open a door of relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>On my arrival in New York, I was accidentally introduced to a gentleman named <persName n="Leggett,,Samuel,,," id="n0196.0007.00192.01204" reg="default:Leggett,Samuel,,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Leggett</surname></persName>, who generously offered me a passage to <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, in the splendid steamboat <rs type="role2">President</rs>, he being a stockholder therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>Thus I was most unexpectedly relieved of my embarrassment, and enabled to reach my place of destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> L. said that he had read with indignation the proceedings of the court at my late trial, and was glad to have an opportunity of serving me. I gave him many thanks for his kindness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>I found the minds of the people strangely indifferent to the subject of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>Their prejudices were invincible,&mdash;stronger, <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> if possible, than those of slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>Objections were started on every hand; apologies for the abominable system constantly saluted my ears; obstacles were industriously piled up in my path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>The cause of this callous state of feeling was owing to their exceeding ignorance of the horrors of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>What was yet more discouraging, my best friends&mdash;without an exception &mdash;besought me to give up the enterprise, and never to return to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>It was not my duty (they argued) to spend my time, and talents, and services, where persecution, reproach and poverty were the only certain reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>My scheme was visionary&mdash;fanatical&mdash;unattainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>Why should I make myself an exile from home and all that I held dear on earth, and sojourn in a strange land, among enemies whose hearts were dead to every noble sentiment? &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. I repeat&mdash;<hi rend="italics">all were against my return</hi>. But I desire to thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that he gave me strength to overcome this selfish and pernicious advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>Opposition served only to increase my ardor, and confirm my purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>But how was I to return?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>I had not a dollar in my pocket, and my time was expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>No <num value="1">one</num> understood my circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>I was too proud to beg, and ashamed to borrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>My friends were prodigal of pity, but of nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>In the extremity of my uneasiness, I went to the <orgName n="Boston Post" type="newspaper">Boston Post</orgName>-office, and found a letter from my friend <persName n="Lundy,,,,," id="n0196.0007.00193.01205" reg="nearbymention:Lundy,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Lundy</surname></persName>, enclosing a draft for <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, from a stranger&mdash;yourself, as a remuneration for my poor, inefficient services in behalf of the slaves!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>Here <placeName key="tgn,7013952" n="1.000 6" reg="providence, providence, rhode island">Providence</placeName> had again signally interfered in my behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>After deducting the expenses of travelling, the remainder of the abovenamed sum was applied in discharging a few of the debts incurred by the unproductiveness of the <hi rend="italics">Genius</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>As I lay on my couch <num value="1">one</num> night, in jail, I was led to contrast my situation with that of the poor slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>Ah! my dear Sir, how wide the difference!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>In <num value="1">one</num> particular only, (I said,) our conditions are similar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>He is confined to the narrow limits of a plantation&mdash;I to the narrow limits of a prison-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>Further all parallels fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>My food is better and more abundant, as I get a pound of bread and a pound of meat, with a plentiful supply of pure water, <hi rend="italics">per diem</hi>. I can lie down or rise up, sit or walk, sing or declaim, read or write, as fancy, pleasure or profit dictates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>Moreover, I am daily cheered with the presence and conversation of friends;&mdash;I am constantly supplied with fresh periodicals from every section of the country, and, consequently, am advertised of every new and interesting occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/><pb id="p.194" n="194"/> Occasionally a letter greets me from a distant place, filled with consolatory expressions, tender remembrances, or fine compliments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>If it rain, my room is a shelter; if the sun flame too intensely, I can choose a shady retreat; if I am sick, medical aid is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>Besides, I have been charged with a specific offence&mdash;have had the privilege of a trial by jury, and the aid of eminent counsel&mdash;and am here ostensibly to satisfy the demands of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>A few months, at the longest, will release me from my captivity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>Now, how is it with the slave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>He gets a peck of corn (occasionally a little more) each week, but rarely meat or fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>He must anticipate the sun in rising, or be whipped severely for his somnolency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>Rain or shine, he must toil early and late <hi rend="italics">for the benefit of another</hi>. If he be weary, he cannot rest&mdash;for the lash of the driver is flourished over his drooping head, or applied to his naked frame; if sick, he is suspected of laziness, and treated accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>For the most trifling or innocent offence, he is felled to the earth, or scourged on his back till it streams with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>Has he a wife and children, he sees them as cruelly treated as himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>He may be torn from them, or they from him, at any moment, never again to meet on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>Friends do not visit and console him: <hi rend="italics">he has no friends</hi>. He knows not what is going on beyond his own narrow boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>He can neither read nor write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>The letters of the alphabet are cabalistical to his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>A thick darkness broods over his soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>Even the <q direct="unspecified">glorious gospel of the blessed <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,</q> which brings life and immortality to perishing man, is a sealed book to his understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>Nor has his wretched condition been imposed upon him for any criminal offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>He has not been tried by the laws of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>No <num value="1">one</num> has stepped forth to vindicate <hi rend="italics">his</hi> rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>He is made an abject slave, simply because <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given him a skin not colored like his master's; and Death, the great <rs>Liberator</rs>, alone can break his fetters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>Reflections like the foregoing turned my prison into a palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>Can you wonder, benevolent Sir, that I was enabled to sing,&mdash; after such an amazing contrast,&mdash;with a heart overflowing with gratitude,&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"> <l>When all thy mercies, O my <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,</l> <l>My rising soul surveys,</l> <l>Transported with the view I'm lost</l> <l>In wonder, love and praise!</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>If the public sympathy is so strongly excited in my behalf, because justice has been denied me in a single instance, <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> how ought it to flame for <emph><num value="2000000">two millions</num></emph> of as valuable and immortal souls, who are crushed beneath the iron car of despotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>O that my countrymen would look at things in their true light!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>O that they might feel as keenly for a black skin as for a white <num value="1">one</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>forgetting me entirely, and thinking only of the poor slave!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>Your generosity deeply affects my heart; but as I have done nothing, and can do nothing, in the cause of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> emancipation, to merit such a gift, I must receive your donation only <hi rend="italics">as a loan on interest</hi>&mdash;to be repaid as soon as <placeName key="tgn,7013952" n="1.000 6" reg="providence, providence, rhode island">Providence</placeName> may enable me to do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2412"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> suit betrays the meanness of avarice and the littleness of revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2413"/>It was <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> not so much a desire to clear his reputation, as to gain a few dollars or gratify a vindictive spirit, that induced the prosecution.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>With regard to the truth of my allegation, that chains were used on board the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Francis</foreName></persName></hi>, it could not be substantiated except by summoning the crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>Generally speaking, irons are inseparable from the slave trade; nor is this usage a grievance in the eye of the law, but a preservative right on the part of owners and masters of vessels engaged in the perilous traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>Whether the slaves, in this instance, were confined or not, was immaterial to the formation of a verdict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>I am now disposed to believe, however, that no chains were used on board of the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Francis</foreName></persName></hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>They are disposable property; and he who bought them to make money, would assuredly sell them for the same reason, whenever an opportunity presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>To say that they were not intended for public sale, is a contemptible quibble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>Of this I was aware: that they were slaves&mdash;the creatures of an absolute despotism; that they were human beings, entitled to all the privileges and enjoyments of liberty; and that no man could assist in their oppression without participating in the guilt of the purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>I must ever regret that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> men were engaged in the inhuman traffic, but not that I promptly exposed them to public censure. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>The decision of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> upon my trial forms the paradox of paradoxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>The law says that the domestic slave trade is a legal business, and no more criminal than the most innocent mechanical or commercial pursuit; and, therefore, that any man may honestly engage in it. Yet, if I charge an individual with following it, either occasionally or regularly, I am guilty of <quote>a gross and malicious libel</quote> &mdash;of <quote>defaming his good name, fame and reputation</quote> &mdash;of <quote>foul calumny and base innuendo</quote> &mdash;with sundry other law phrases, as set forth in an indictment!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>So much for the consistency of the law!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>So much for the equity of the <rs type="place">Court</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>The trial, in fact, was not to ascertain whether my charges were true, but whether they contained anything disreputable to the character of the accused; and the verdict does not implicate or condemn me, but the law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>The hat-making business, for instance, is an authorized trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>Suppose I were to accuse a man of making hats, and should believe, and publicly declare as my opinion, that every hat-maker ought be imprisoned for life: would this be libellous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>It is my belief, that every distiller or vender of ardent spirits is a poisoner of the health and morals of community; but have I not a right to express this belief without subjection to fine and imprisonment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2440"/>I believe, moreover, that every man who kills another, either in a duel or battle, is, in the eye of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, guilty of his blood; but is it criminal or punishable to cherish or avow such an opinion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>What is freedom of thought, or freedom of expression?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>It is my right&mdash;and no body of men can legally deprive me of it&mdash;to interrogate the moral aspect and public utility of every pursuit or traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2443"/>True, my views may be ridiculous or fanatical; but they may also be just and benevolent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2444"/>Free inquiry is the essence, the life-blood of liberty; <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> and they who deny men the right to use it, are the enemies of the republic.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>Dear sir: Having directed the paper which you have very politely sent me to be discontinued, various considerations render it proper that I should frankly state to you my reasons for having done so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>I believe as strongly as any other man that slavery is very wicked, and very destructive to the best interests both of master and slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>But this does not seem to me to decide that immediate emancipation of all the slaves in the U. S. would be either wise or just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>Very much may be required to be done before liberty would be a blessing to the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>I may have embezzled the property of a minor, and may have brought him up in misery and vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>It is wrong for me to hold this property for my own benefit, but it would be neither wise nor right to put it at once into the possession of my ward, and by so doing to expose him to temptations which his previous education had not prepared him to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>I should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> teach him how to use it, and then put him in possession of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>But even granting the propriety of Immediate Emancipation, there are other important questions to be settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>Shall we seek to bring about this event by enlightening, convincing, and persuading the masters, or by exciting to rebellion the slaves?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>If this desirable event can be accomplished by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these methods, it will prevent bloodshed; it will improve the moral character of both parties; it will bind them together by the feeling of benevolence on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and gratitude on the other; it will be permanent in its effects, and will be a glorious triumph to the cause of philanthropy by inducing man voluntarily to perform a great and noble action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>Such seems to me the mode which Christianity would approve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/>If we, on the contrary, attempt to accomplish this result by exciting the slaves to rebellion, success can only be looked for after a most bloody servile war, destructive to all the better feelings of both parties, leaving them in interminable hatred, and utterly unfit for any permanently amicable adjustment; and after all, the event will be left to the mere accident of physical superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/>Whichever might succeed, neither party would be substantially better off than at present, and an ocean of blood would have been needlessly shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/>Men are not often made better or happier by war, specially by servile war, the most destructive and demoralizing of all the forms of human massacre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/>Now I regret to say, my dear sir, that so far as I can judge, the tendency of your paper is to produce the latter of these results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>Its attitude to the slave-owners is menacing and vindictive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>The tendency of your remarks is to prejudice their minds against a cool discussion of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>On the contrary, the miseries of the slaves are set forth in a manner calculated to arouse their most destructive passions [and urge] them on to resistance at all hazards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>Should such a catastrophe ever occur, I am sure that you or I would rather have lost our right hand than have written a word which should have contributed in the least degree to hasten it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>I believe that you, my dear sir, have suffered injustice in consequence of your efforts in this cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/>But let us remember the <name>Gospel</name> teaches us forgiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>Let us strive to do <hi rend="italics">good to all men</hi>&mdash;masters as well as slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>In this course we shall be more useful, and, I think, follow more closely our Master in Heaven.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>Their grievances, great as they were, were trifling in comparison with the wrongs and sufferings of those for whom we plead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>Our fathers were never slaves&mdash;never bought and sold like cattle&mdash;never shut out from the light of knowledge and religion&mdash;never subjected to the lash of brutal taskmasters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>But those for whose emancipation we are striving&mdash;constituting at the present time at least <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> part of our countrymen&mdash;are recognized by law, and treated by their fellow-beings, as marketable commodities, as goods and chattels, as brute beasts; are plundered daily of the fruits of their toil without redress; really enjoy no constitutional nor legal protection from licentious and murderous outrages upon their persons; and are ruthlessly torn asunder&mdash;the tender babe from the arms of its frantic mother&mdash;the heart-broken wife from her weeping husband&mdash;at the caprice or pleasure of irresponsible tyrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>For the crime of having a dark complexion, they suffer the pangs of hunger, the infliction of stripes, the ignominy of brutal servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>They are kept in heathenish darkness by laws expressly enacted to make their instruction a criminal offence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5452"/>These are the prominent circumstances in the condition of more than <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of our people, the proof of which may be found in <num value="1000">thousands</num> of indisputable facts and in the laws of the slaveholding States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5453"/>Hence we maintain&mdash;that, in view of the civil and religious privileges of this nation, the guilt of its oppression is unequalled by any other on the face of the earth; and, therefore, that it is bound to repent instantly, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5454"/><pb id="p.410" n="410"/></p> 
<p>We further maintain&mdash;that no man has a right to enslave or imbrute his brother&mdash;to hold or acknowledge him, for <num value="1">one</num> moment, as a piece of merchandise&mdash;to keep back his hire by fraud&mdash;or to brutalize his mind, by denying him the means of intellectual, social and moral improvement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5455"/>The right to enjoy liberty is inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5456"/>To invade it is to usurp the prerogative of Jehovah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5459"/>Surely, the sin is as great to enslave an American as an African.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>Therefore we believe and affirm&mdash;that there is no difference, in principle, between the <name>African</name> slave trade and American slavery:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>That every <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName> who retains a human being in involuntary bondage as his property, is, according to Scripture (Ex.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/><num value="21">XXI</num>. <num value="16">16</num>), a man-stealer:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5463"/>That the slaves ought instantly to be set free, and brought under the protection of law:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>That if they had lived from the time of <persName><foreName>Pharaoh</foreName></persName> down to the present period, and had been entailed through successive generations, their right to be free could never have been alienated, but their claims would have constantly risen in solemnity:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>That all those laws which are now in force, admitting the right of slavery, are therefore, before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, utterly null and void; being an audacious usurpation of the <name>Divine</name> prerogative, a daring infringement on the law of nature, a base overthrow of the very foundations of the social compact, a complete extinction of all the relations, endearments and obligations of mankind, and a presumptuous transgression of all the holy commandments; and that therefore they ought instantly to be abrogated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>We further believe and affirm&mdash;that all persons of color who possess the qualifications which are demanded of others, ought to be admitted forthwith to the enjoyment of the same privileges, and the exercise of the same prerogatives, as others; and that the paths of preferment, of wealth, and of intelligence, should be opened as widely to them as to persons of a white complexion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5467"/>We maintain that no compensation should be given to the planters emancipating their slaves:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>Because it would be a surrender of the great fundamental principle, that man cannot hold property in man; <pb id="p.411" n="411"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/>Because slavery is a crime, and therefore is not an article to be sold;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>Because the holders of slaves are not the just proprietors of what they claim; freeing the slave is not depriving them of property, but restoring it to its rightful owner; it is not wronging the master, but righting the slave&mdash;restoring him to himself;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>Because immediate and general emancipation would only destroy nominal, not real, property; it would not amputate a limb or break a bone of the slaves, but, by infusing motives into their breasts, would make them doubly valuable to the masters as free laborers; and</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>Because, if compensation is to be given at all, it should be given to the outraged and guiltless slaves, and not to those who have plundered and abused them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>We regard as delusive, cruel and dangerous any scheme of expatriation which pretends to aid, either directly or indirectly, in the emancipation of the slaves, or to be a substitute for the immediate and total abolition of slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>We fully and unanimously recognize the sovereignty of each State, to legislate exclusively on the subject of the slavery which is tolerated within its limits; we concede that Congress, under the present national compact, has no right to interfere with any of the slave States in relation to this momentous subject:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5475"/>But we maintain that Congress has a right, and is solemnly bound, to suppress the domestic slave trade between the several States, and to abolish slavery in those portions of our territory which the <rs>Constitution</rs> has placed under its exclusive jurisdiction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5476"/>We also maintain that there are, at the present time, the highest obligations resting upon the people of the free States to remove slavery by moral and political action, as prescribed in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>They are now living under a pledge of their tremendous physical force, to fasten the galling fetters of tyranny upon the limbs of <num value="1000000">millions</num> in the <rs>Southern States</rs>; they are liable to be called at any moment to suppress a general insurrection of the slaves; they authorize the slaveowner to vote for <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of his slaves as property, and thus enable him to perpetuate his oppression; they support a standing army at the <rs>South</rs> for its protection; and they seize the slave who has escaped into their territories, and send him back to be tortured by an enraged master or a brutal driver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/><pb id="p.412" n="412"/> This relation to slavery is criminal, and full of danger: it must be broken up.</p>

<p>Permit us briefly to trace our career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>We commenced the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> without having obtained previously a single subscriber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5731"/>In the course of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, about <num value="500">500</num> subscribers were added to our list: of course, this number was inadequate to our support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>It slowly increased, however, during the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> volumes, up to <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct>, and then to about <dateStruct value="1400--"><year reg="1400">1400</year></dateStruct>; and so did its expenses increase, owing to its enlargement without enhancing the terms of subscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>All this time, we lived in the most frugal and humble manner, in order by the utmost selfdenial to sustain the paper, and disappoint the hopes and predictions of its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>Still we struggled under many embarrassments, and were in bondage to penury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>We gratefully acknowledge that several generous donations were made to us for the support of the paper, from various persons and societies; and had it not been for these, it would have long since ceased to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5736"/>These were not sufficient to remove the burden, although they alleviated its pressure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5737"/>In commencing our present volume (the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>) we again enlarged the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, still affording it at its original price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5738"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the prospect looked very encouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5739"/>In less than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, <num value="600">six hundred</num> new subscribers were added to our subscription list&mdash;principally obtained in the cities of New York and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, but under such circumstances as to afford us no substantial aid: in fact, so remiss have they been up to this hour, in complying with the terms of the paper, that they have only increased our difficulties.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>To carp at my composition, and yet confess the justness of my principles, as many do, is very much like sneering at the black man on account of his complexion, and yet conceding that he has all the marks and attributes of manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6866"/>If not, sir, you will help me to additional reasons for our staying here at the <rs>North</rs>, in my answer to another question which is iterated on all occasions&mdash;viz.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6867"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>What have <hi rend="italics">we</hi> to do with Southern slavery?</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6868"/>This question is put, sometimes with reference to legislation &mdash;at others, it refers to moral obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6869"/>I answer, then, that we, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, have legislated on the subject of slavery, and we have a right to legislate upon it, within certain limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6870"/>As to our moral obligation, it belongs to our nature, and is a part of our accountability, of which neither time nor distance, neither climate nor location, neither republican nor monarchical government, can divest us. Let there be but <num value="1">one</num> slave on the face of the globe&mdash;let him stand on <num value="1">one</num> extremity of the globe, and place me on the other&mdash;let every people, and tribe, and clime, and nation, stand as barriers between him and myself: still, I am bound to sympathize with him &mdash;to pray, and toil, and plead for his deliverance&mdash;to make known his wrongs, and vindicate his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6871"/>It may not be in my power, it may not be my duty, directly to emancipate him; <pb id="p.509" n="509"/> for the power rests in the hands of the tyrant who keeps him in chains, and it is his duty to break them asunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6872"/>But it matters not, except to demand an increase of zeal and activity, if every interposing tribe or nation, if the whole world, is to be changed, before that solitary slave can go free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6873"/>Then I will begin with him who stands next by my side, and with my associates, and with my country; and if the impulse must be sent by proxy, if every man, woman and child must be abolitionized by detail, before the captive can be disenthralled, I am nevertheless bound to commence the work, if no others will, and to cooperate with them if they have begun it. Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6874"/>Because he is my neighbor, though occupying the remotest point of the earth; and I am charged by the <name>Lamb</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the judge of quick and dead, to love my neighbor as myself. . . . Because by it an example is set which, if passively submitted to, <hi rend="italics">may lead to the enslavement of others</hi>&mdash;of a community&mdash;of a people&mdash; of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6875"/><hi rend="italics">Enslave but a single human being, and the liberty of the world is put in peril</hi>. . . . Hence it is, that whether I contemplate slavery singly or in the aggregate, my soul kindles within me&mdash;the entire man is moved with indignation and abhorrence&mdash;I cannot pause, I cannot slumber&mdash;I am ready for attack, and will admit of no truce and of no compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6876"/>The war is a war of extermination; and I will perish before an inch shall be surrendered, seeing that the liberties of mankind, the happiness and harmony of the universe, and the authority and majesty of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, are involved in the issue. . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6880"/>Now, if <hi rend="italics">Old</hi> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may meddle with this <quote>delicate</quote> subject, surely <hi rend="italics">New</hi> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may venture to do so likewise.
