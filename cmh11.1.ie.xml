<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> was several months behind some other States of the <rs>South</rs> in the preparation to do her part in the war. This was due to <num value="2">two</num> causes: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, a course of political events that placed the chief executive of the <rs>State</rs> in opposition to the will of the mass of the people in regard to the right and policy of immediate State action; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, being a frontier State, she had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to expel from her borders a large body of Federal troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>These causes which delayed <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> demanded that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> efforts of the people should be made for their removal, and therefore it was near the <dateStruct value="1861-06-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> before attention could be given to raising troops for the <rs>Confederate</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>It is due to the people of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> that these embarrassments should be explained in the history of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>There was no record of the organization of the <rs>Texas</rs> troops kept in the executive offices of the <rs>State</rs>, and hence, in writing this history, the principal sources of information were found in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">war department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as follows: <num value="1">1</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In none of these, however, are stated the original organization of the commands, or the changes of the field officers by promotion or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>These had to be obtained, when practicable, from other sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Much information <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> on these and other subjects was derived from the <name>History</name> of <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n0255.0001.00004.00002" reg="mostcommon:Walker,John,G.,,:5"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName>, by <persName n="Blessington,,J.,P.,," id="n0255.0001.00004.00003" reg="default:Blessington,J.,P.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Blessington</surname></persName>, from officers and soldiers still living, and from other reliable persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Information in regard to the government and civil officers of the <rs>State</rs> has been obtained from the executive offices of the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName> at <placeName reg="Austin, Travis, Texas" key="tgn,7013346">Austin</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The effort, at this late day, to make a consecutive and consistent account of the part taken by <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and her people in the war between the <name>States</name> has been an arduous and difficult task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>While it must fail to do full justice to the subject, it is hoped that the perusal of it will exhibit an earnest effort to make the best performance practicable under the circumstances by the</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>When the crisis was pending in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> was in an unfavorable condition, politically, to promptly join her sister Southern States in the movement for secession from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This was not from the lack of Southern sentiment generally pervading the mass of the people of the <rs>State</rs>, but from political differences that had resulted from the course of events previous to that time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The great struggle in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to the <rs>Union</rs> exhibited parties in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, formed or forming, antagonistic to the institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, and to their extension to other territory to become a part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The fact that the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, in control of the government, admitted <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs>, caused the great body of the people of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> afterward to align themselves with that party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This action was so nearly unanimous that in <num value="6">six</num> general elections for State executive officers, during the <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure>, it was not necessary to hold conventions to make nominations by the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>There were political events before the end of that time which tended to make inroads upon the unanimity, and caused the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> to make nominations for governor and other executive officers in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, when <persName n="Runnels,,H.,R.,," id="n0255.0002.00005.00006" reg="default:Runnels,H.,R.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Runnels</surname></persName> was nominated for <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> the office of governor, and <persName n="Lubbock,,F.,R.,," id="n0255.0002.00006.00007" reg="expanded:Lubbock,Francis,R.,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Lubbock</surname></persName> for that of lieutenant-governor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><num value="1">One</num> of those events was when, upon the passage of the <rs>Kansas</rs> and <rs>Nebraska</rs> bill in Congress, in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Houston,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00006.00008" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> voted against the bill, with the <rs>Northern Free Soilers</rs>, and <persName n="Rusk,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00006.00009" reg="mostcommon:Rusk,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Rusk</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> voted for the bill, with the <rs>Democratic</rs> and Whig senators of the <rs>South</rs>, except <persName n="Bell,,John,,," id="n0255.0002.00006.00010" reg="default:Bell,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, who also voted against it. This, with other votes given by <persName n="Houston,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00006.00011" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName>, caused a strong opposition to be made against him politically in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>That, however, did not prevent him from openly and vigorously defending his course in the <name>Senate</name>, which drew to him large numbers of adherents, who became alienated from the regularly organized <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Another political event was the advent, from the <rs>North</rs> into <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, of the <q direct="unspecified">Know Nothing</q> order, a secret organization, afterward called the <rs>American</rs> party, that crept almost unknown to the public into the different parts of the <rs>State</rs>, and embraced a large number of citizens who organized as a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, advocating the extension of time to <measure n="21years" type="date">twenty-one years</measure> for the naturalization of foreign immigrants, and opposition to Catholicism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>As a party they did not publicly nominate a candidate for the various offices from the lowest to the highest in the <rs>State</rs>; but their concerted action in voting for particular candidates, generally in opposition to the nominees of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, when nominations were made, soon exhibited a strong influence in county district and State elections.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Still another dangerous event was the formation in the <rs>North</rs> of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> with a platform, as it was regarded in the <rs>South</rs>, embracing all the leading principles of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, as held by different portions of their people; they being centralism, federalism, free-soilism and abolitionism, upon which <persName n="Fremont,Colonel,,,," id="n0255.0002.00006.00012" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> ran as a candidate for <rs type="role2">President</rs> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>. <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> Though not elected, he received of the popular vote, <num value="1341812">1,341,812</num>, and of the presidential electors, <num value="127">127</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This remarkable combination portended danger to all the cherished political principles of Southern Democrats and ultimately to their peculiar industrial institutions; notwithstanding which it was currently reported that if <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00013" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> had been elected an effort would have been made by leading men in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> for submission to his administration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The political situation was made still more perplexing by the espousal by Northern Democrats, and even by some Democrats in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, of what was denominated squatter-sovereignty, which was a contention for the right of a territory before becoming a State, but when organized in a territorial government, to admit or exclude slavery at its own discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Southern Democrats held that it was only when a constitution was framed in a territory that this could be done; and they believed they had the precedents of the acts of Congress and the decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme court</orgName> in support of the <rs>Southern</rs> view on that subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>With all these matters agitating the minds of the people of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, by which differences of opinion had been generated, <persName n="Houston,Senator,Sam,,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00014" reg="default:Houston,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> became an independent candidate for governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This was in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, the most exciting canvass that was ever witnessed throughout <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>As the nominee, <persName n="Runnels,,H.,R.,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00015" reg="default:Runnels,H.,R.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Runnels</surname></persName>, did not make public speeches, <persName n="Houston,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00016" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> was answered in many, if not most of the places where he spoke, by prominent Democratic orators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>That brought out all of <persName n="Houston,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00017" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName>'s powers to arouse the people in vindication of his course in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He styled himself an old-time Democrat, but he was supported by the <rs>Americans</rs>, disaffected Democrats, and his old <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> friends who would vote for him irrespective of their individual views as to his course in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At the election that year, <persName n="Runnels,,H.,R.,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00018" reg="default:Runnels,H.,R.,,"><foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Runnels</surname></persName> received <num value="32552">32,552</num> votes, and <persName n="Houston,,,,," id="n0255.0002.00007.00019" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Sam,,,"><surname>Houston</surname></persName> <num value="23628">23,628</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>For <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> <persName n="Lubbock,Lieutenant-Governor,F.,R.,," id="n0255.0002.00008.00020" reg="expanded:Lubbock,Francis,R.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Governor">lieutenant-governor</roleName>, <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Lubbock</surname></persName> received <num value="33379">33,379</num>, his opponent, <persName n="Grimes,,Jesse,,," id="n0255.0002.00008.00021" reg="default:Grimes,Jesse,,,"><foreName>Jesse</foreName> <surname>Grimes</surname></persName>, <num value="20818">20,818</num>, and <persName n="Smith,,F.,,," id="n0255.0002.00008.00022" reg="default:Smith,F.,,,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> <num value="878">878</num>. <persName n="Houston,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00008.00023" reg="nearbymention:Houston,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Houston</surname></persName> continued to occupy his seat in the <name>Senate</name> until his term expired, which was before the next general election.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> <persName n="Runnels,Governor,,,," id="n0255.0002.00008.00024" reg="nearbymention:Runnels,H.,R.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Runnels</surname></persName> delivered a message to the legislature, in which he discussed the revolutionary proceedings in the <placeName key="possibilities=14" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Territory of Kansas</placeName> to the injury of Southern interests, and referred to the action of Congress as encouraging and not repressing the growing agitation of the slavery question, all of which made it incumbent upon each State to look to its own protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He recommended resolutions to be passed, making provision for co-operation with other Southern States in a consultation for the mutual protection of their constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The legislature passed resolutions (approved <dateStruct value="1858-02-16"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>) authorizing the governor to order an election for <num value="7">seven</num> delegates to meet delegates appointed by the <rs>Southern States</rs> in convention whenever the executives of a majority of the slaveholding States shall express the opinion that such convention is necessary to preserve the equal rights of such States in the <rs>Union</rs>; and appropriated <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">$10,000</measure>, or as much thereof as was necessary, to pay the expenses of the delegates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> resolution provided that should an exigency arise, in the opinion of the governor, in which it is necessary for the <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">State of Texas</placeName> to act alone through a convention representing the sovereignty of the <rs>State</rs>, he is hereby requested to call a special session of the legislature to provide for such <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State convention</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This message and the resolutions give evidence of being prompted by serious apprehension of great trouble prevailing in the minds of the people of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>That apprehension was justified by the long-continued agitation of the slavery question, which continually increased in virulence in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, and was led by such distinguished statesmen as <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0255.0002.00008.00025" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> and <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n0255.0002.00009.00026" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The newspapers were teeming with it from day to day. <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n0255.0002.00009.00027" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> said in the <name>Senate</name> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, <q direct="unspecified">To the overthrow of the slave power we are summoned by a double call, <num value="1">one</num> political and the other philanthropic: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, to remove an oppressive tyranny from the national government; and secondly, to open the gates of emancipation in the slave States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Such sentiments continued to be publicly uttered during the year <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>. <persName n="Seward,Senator,,,," id="n0255.0002.00009.00028" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, in his speeches at <placeName reg="Rochester, Monroe, New York" key="tgn,7014348">Rochester</placeName> and at <placeName reg="Rome, Oneida, New York" key="tgn,7014359">Rome, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>That issue he discussed under the following question: <q direct="unspecified">Shall the social organization of the <rs>North</rs> supplant that of the <rs>South</rs>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>and asserted that <q direct="unspecified">free labor and slave labor cannot exist together in the <rs>Union</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This doubtless reflected the real sentiments of his party, of which he was known to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most prominent leaders, as he had been <num value="1">one</num> of its most efficient originators.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Notwithstanding all this, there was a large body of the citizens of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> who still had confidence that the general government would be administered so as to protect the constitutional rights of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>These were classed politically as Union men; they generally objected to the action of the governor and legislature, as prematurely encouraging the sentiment of disunion among the people of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Thus was raised the questions of the right and expediency of secession, which, during <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, up to the time of the general State election, brought out those great debates and discussions by the leading statesmen of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, by which the people were thoroughly aroused, although many held aloof, believing the agitation premature and that it was unnecessary at that time to submit the questions to ballot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Unfortunately, there was another disturbing subject thrust before the public view during that period in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>That was the <name>African</name> slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Sir: On the morning of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> the blockading fleet off the bar of <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName> consisted of <num value="8">eight</num> vessels, <num value="4">four</num> of which were armed steamers, <num value="1">one</num> a mortar boat, and all but <num value="1">one</num> of them apparently of such draught as to admit of their crossing the bar. At about <time value="7am">7 a. m.</time> <num value="1">one</num> of the steamers (the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs>) crossed the bar flying a white flag, and when opposite <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName>, a shot from our battery was fired across her bow, and she immediately came to anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>An officer soon after landed from the steamer in front of the battery and asked an interview with the commander of the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Immediately upon being advised of this, I repaired to <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName>, and was informed by the officer who had landed that the commander of the fleet desired me to send out a messenger to receive a communication from him. Having no boat at the <rs type="place">Point</rs>, I returned to the city and immediately dispatched a messenger in a boat, flying a white flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The boat left the wharf <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> about <time value="1pm">1 p. m.</time>, and before she could be worked out to the <rs type="place">Point</rs> the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> weighed anchor, repassed the bar and communicated with the fleet, and the <num value="4">four</num> steamers with the mortar boat in tow came in over the bar and up to about the position where the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> had been brought to anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>As soon as this movement was observed, I started for <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName>, but before I could reach there a shot was fired from our battery in front of the foremost of the advancing vessels&mdash;our flag of truce boat then being but a short distance off&mdash;when the enemy, disregarding their own white flag, immediately opened fire from all the vessels with about <num value="20">twenty</num> guns on our battery, which consisted of but <num value="1">one</num> gun, a <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure>, and they continued to play upon it until the gun was struck by a shot and so disabled as to be unserviceable, and the officer in command ordered the gun to be spiked and the barracks fired, and the men retreated across the low, open ground toward the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>I joined them soon after they left the battery, and the <num value="5">five</num> vessels of the enemy having passed entirely around the point into the harbor, continued to throw shot and shell at us until we were out of their range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Upon the fleet turning up the channel toward the city, the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="24">24</num>-pounders in battery on the bay side, near the east end of the city, opened fire on them, but our shot fell short, and the vessels having now come up to our flag of truce boat, ceased firing and took our messenger on board their flagship, and the fleet came to anchor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The assemblage of vessels off the bar on the day previous had given us every reason to expect an attack, and during that day and the morning of the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>, I had made arrangements with the <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName> to be ready with transportation to meet any emergency that might occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Having some time previous to this been ordered by the general commanding the department to withdraw our troops from the city in case the enemy should bring to bear against our position such a force as to overcome our defenses at <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName> and enable them to command the harbor, and after the gun at <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName> was silenced, having no further effective means of defending the harbor or protecting the city from bombardment by the enemy or inflicting any injury on them, immediately after our troops had abandoned <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName>, I ordered the <num value="2">two</num> guns which were in position at <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> battery, on the south side of <placeName reg="Galveston Island, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,1007166">Galveston island</placeName>, to be spiked and all our material at that and <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> other points in the city to be taken to the railroad depot, which was done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>At about <time value="3:30pm">3:30 p. m.</time> our flag of truce returned to the city bearing a demand from the commander for the surrender of the city, and demanding an immediate answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>I sent a messenger with the answer that I should not surrender the city, directing the messenger also to say to the commander of the fleet that there were many women and children, and to demand time to remove them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>After some negotiation it was agreed that no attack should be made upon the city for <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>; that during that time we should not construct any new or strengthen any old defenses within the city, and the fleet not be brought any nearer the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>This arrangement gave us ample time for the removal of all who desired to leave the island, also for the removal of our troops and material of every kind.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>I caused the people of the city to be fully notified in relation to matters which you directed they should be advised of. All machinery of any value was removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The civil authorities removed all county records of every kind and all the records of the city corporation and of the <orgName n="District Court" type="court">district court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName> removed all their material of every kind, and by <time value="11am">11 a. m.</time> of the <dateStruct value="--8"><day reg="8">8th</day></dateStruct> we had removed all the government property of any value, except the <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure> gun at <placeName reg="Fort Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2335472">Fort Point</placeName>, and a large majority of the population of the city left their houses and the island.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The troops having all been removed in accordance with your orders, I left with my staff for <placeName reg="Virginia Point, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,2108288">Virginia point</placeName>, leaving a sufficient force to hold the battery at the south end of the railroad bridge, and that evening I reported at this place to <persName n="Debray,Colonel,X.,B.,," id="n0255.0009.00075.00937" reg="expanded:Debray,Xavier,Blanchard,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>X.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Debray</surname></persName>, commanding sub-military district of <placeName reg="Houston, Harris, Texas" key="tgn,7013727">Houston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The officer in charge of the flag replied that <num value="1">one</num> hour was the time he was authorized to grant, but in consideration of the fact that an epidemic (yellow fever) was still raging in the town, he would extend the time to <num value="1">one</num> hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>; at the expiration of which period they moved up abreast the town and opened fire from both steamers upon both the town and batteries.
