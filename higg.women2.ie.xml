<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The world is full of books that narrate the deeds and utter the praises of men. The lives of eminent men of our own time are made familiar to us in newspapers and magazines, in individual sketches and autobiographies, as well as in histories, dictionaries of biography, cyclopedias and other works of greater or less range of subject and extent of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>But, while many things have been written both by and for women, and much information has been published in <num value="1">one</num> form and another in respect to eminent women of our age, there is not in existence, so far as the publishers are aware, any work, or series of works, which supplies the information contained in this volume, or preoccupies its field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>And it appears to the publishers that there is a demand for this very work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The discussions of the present day in regard to the elevation of woman, her duties, and the position which she is fitted to occupy, seem to call for some authentic and attractive record of the lives and achievements of those women of our time who have distinguished themselves in their various occupations and conditions in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The knowledge of what has been attempted and accomplished by eminent women of our time is fitted to make an impression for good upon the young women of our land, and upon the whole American public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>It will tend to develop and strengthen correct ideas respecting the influence of woman, and her share in the privileges and responsibilities of human life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In selecting the subjects for the sketches here presented, regard has been had not only to individual excellence or eminence, but also to a proper representation of the various professions in which women have distinguished themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>For obvious reasons, also, the selection has been confined chiefly to American women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>In selecting the writers for the various sketches, the publishers have chosen those only whom they knew to be thoroughly qualified for the particular tasks assigned them, and so interested in the subjects of their sketches as to be prepared to do them full justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Great attention has been given to the collection of materials which should be at once interesting and authentic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Variety and freshness of interest are secured by obtaining sketches from a large number of able writers, and by arranging their contributions so that no <num value="2">two</num> consecutive chapters are the production of the same person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>As it was impossible, on account of the lack of space, to give extended sketches of all who ought to be noticed in this volume, and in some cases, also, the requisite materials for such sketches could not be procured, briefer notices have been prepared of certain groups, which, it is believed, will be no unacceptable addition to the more elaborate chapters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This work aims to present in its literary department, as well as in its engravings, an attractive series of accurate and life-like pictures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>As a literary production, containing the best essays and finest thoughts of many of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> writers of the day, it must be a source of profit and pleasure to every reader of critical taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The engravings, like the written sketches, are no creations of fancy, but trustworthy delineations of the features of those whom they profess to represent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The publishers have spared neither time nor expense in the preparation of the present work, and they confidently believe that the importance of the field which it occupies, the ability and reputation of its writers, the freshness and reliableness of its facts, and the excellence of its engravings and typography, will justify the praises already bestowed upon its plan and execution by men and women of discernment, and insure to it a wide-spread and lasting popularity.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Nightingale,,Florence,,," id="n0202.0002.00011.00004" reg="default:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><foreName>Florence</foreName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the fortunate of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Inheriting from nature a striking and beneficent talent, she was able to cultivate that talent in circumstances the most favorable that could be imagined, and, finally, to exercise it on the grandest scale in the sight of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Whatever difficulties may have beset her path, they were placed in it not by untoward fortune; they existed in the nature of her work, or were inseparable from human life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>She has had the happiness, also, of laboring in a purely disinterested spirit, and has been able to do for love what money could neither procure nor reward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The felicity of both her names, <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName></hi> and <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Nightingale,,,,," id="n0202.0002.00011.00005" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><surname>Nightingale</surname></persName></hi>, has often been remarked; and it appears that she owes both of them to accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Her father is William Edward Shore, an English gentleman of an ancient and wealthy <persName n="Sheffield,,,,," id="n0202.0002.00011.00006" reg="mostcommon:Sheffield,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheffield</surname></persName> family, and her mother is a daughter of <persName n="Smith,,William,,," id="n0202.0002.00011.00007" reg="default:Smith,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who was for many years a member of Parliament, where he was particularly distinguished for his advocacy of the emancipation of the slaves in the <rs>British</rs> possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, her father inherited the estates of his grand-uncle, <persName n="Nightingale,,Peter,,," id="n0202.0002.00011.00008" reg="default:Nightingale,Peter,,,"><foreName>Peter</foreName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName>, on the condition expressed in his uncle's will, of his assuming the name of <persName n="Nightingale,,,,," id="n0202.0002.00011.00009" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Peter,,,"><surname>Nightingale</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It so happened that she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> the light while the family were residing at the beautiful city of <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, and to this fact she is indebted for her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The family consists of but <num value="4">four</num> members, father, mother, and the <num value="2">two</num> daughters, <persName n="Parthenope,,,,," id="n0202.0002.00012.00010" reg="mostcommon:Parthenope,nomatch:0"><surname>Parthenope</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The date of the birth of the younger sister, <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, is variously given in the slight accounts which have been published of her life; but it was said in the public prints, at the time when her name was on every tongue, that she was born in the same year as <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Victoria</foreName></persName>, which was <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Her father is a well-informed and intelligent man, and it was under his guidance that she attained a considerable proficiency in the <rs>Latin</rs> language and in mathematics, as well as in the usual branches and accomplishments of female education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Early in life she was conversant with <name>French</name>, <name>German</name>, and <name>Italian</name>; she became also a respectable performer upon the piano; and she had that general acquaintance with science, and that interest in objects of art, which usually mark the intelligent mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Even as a little girl she was observed to have a particular fondness for nursing the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>She had the true nurse's touch, and that ready sympathy with the afflicted which enables those who possess it to divine their wants before they are expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, as in most other densely peopled countries, poverty and disease abound on every side, in painful contrast to the elegance and abundance by which persons of the rank of <persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00012.00011" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Peter,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> are surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><num value="1">One</num> consequence of this is, that the daughters of affluence, unless they are remarkably devoid of good feeling, employ part of their leisure in visiting the cottages of the poor, and ministering to the wants of the infirm and the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It was thus that <persName n="Nightingale,,Florence,,," id="n0202.0002.00012.00012" reg="default:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><foreName>Florence</foreName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> began her voluntary apprenticeship to the noble art of mitigating human anguish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Not content with paying the usual round of visits to the cottages near her father's estate, and giving, here a little soup, and <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> there a flannel petticoat, and at another place a poor man's plaster, she seriously studied the art of nursing, visited &mdash; hospitals in the neighborhood, and read with the utmost eagerness whatever she could find in her father's library relating to the treatment of disease, and the management of asylums</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>This was no romantic fancy of her youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00013.00013" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> is a truly intelligent and gifted woman,--as far as possible removed from the cast of character which is at once described and stigmatized by the word romantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>She earnestly desired to know the best manner of mitigating the sufferings of the sick, the wounded, and the infirm; and she studied this beautiful science as a man studies that which he truly and ardently wishes to understand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>As it is the custom of wealthy families in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to spend part of every year in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, <persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00013.00014" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> was enabled to extend the sphere of her observation to the numberless hospitals and asylums of that metropolis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>These institutions are on the grandest scale, and were liberally endowed by the generosity of former ages; but at that time many of them abounded in abuses and defects of every description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Everywhere she saw the need of better nurses, women trained and educated to their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Excellent surgeons were to be found in most of them; but in many instances the admirable skill of the surgeon was balked and frustrated by the blundering ignorance or the obstinate conceit of the nurse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Those who observed this elegant young lady moving softly about the wards of the hospitals, little imagined, perhaps, that from her was to come the reform of those institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00013.00015" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> may almost be said to have created the art of which she is the most illustrious teacher; but she was yet far from having perfected herself; many years were still to elapse before she was prepared to speak with the authority of a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><persName n="Camp,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0002.00013.00016" reg="mostcommon:Camp,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Camp</surname></persName> still flourished for a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>although her days were numbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><pb id="p.14" n="14"/></p> 
<p>It must not be supposed that this noble-minded lady denied herself the pleasures proper to her age, sex, and rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>She enjoyed society and the pleasures of society, both in the country and in town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Without being strictly beautiful, her face was singularly pleasing in its expression, and she had a slight, trim, and graceful figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Her circle of friends and acquaintances was large, and among them she was always welcome; but, like most properly constituted persons of our <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0202.0002.00014.00017" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> blood, the happiest spot to her on earth was her own home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The family connection of the <name>Nightingales</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is numerous, and she had friends enough for all the purposes of life among her own relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>About <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>, in company with her parents and sister, she made an extensive tour in <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, visiting everywhere the hospitals, infirmaries, and asylums, and watching closely the modes of treatment practised in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The family continued their journey into <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, where they resided &mdash; for a considerable time, and where the gifts of <persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00014.00018" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> in nursing the sick were, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, called into requisition beyond the circle of her own family and dependants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Several sick Arabs, it is said, were healed by her during this journey, which extended as far as' the farthest cataracts of the <rs>Nile</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Her tour was of eminent use to her in many ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It increased her familiarity with the languages of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and gave her a certain knowledge of the world and of men, as well as of her art, which she turned to such admirable account a few years later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Returning to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, she resumed her ordinary life as the daughter of a country gentleman; but not for a long time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00014.00019" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName>, born into the <orgName n="England Church" type="church">Church of England</orgName>, was then, and has ever since remained, a devoted member of it. In her religion, however, there is nothing bigoted nor excessive; she is <num value="1">one</num> of those who manifest it chiefly by cheerfulness, charity, and good-living; nor does her attachment to <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> her own church blind her to the excellences of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>In her travels upon the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, she had often met the <rs>Sisters</rs> of Charity, and members of other Catholic Orders, serving in the hospitals.and asylums, and serving, too, with a fidelity, constancy, and skill, which excited in her the highest admiration and the profoundest respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was a favorite dream of her youth, that, perhaps, there might <num value="1">one</num> day be among Protestants some kind of Order of Nurses,a band of women devoted, for a time, or for life, to the holy awl arduous work of alleviating the anguish of the sick-bed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>About the year <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, she heard that there was something of the kind in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, under the charge of a benevolent lady and a venerable Lutheran pastor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>She hastened to enter this school of nurses, and spent <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> there, acquiring valuable details of her art. In the hospital attached to it she served as <num value="1">one</num> of the regular corps of nurses, among whom she was greatly distinguished for her skill and thoroughness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Upon her return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, an opportunity was speedily furnished her for exercising her improved skill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>A very numerous class in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> are family governesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><name>English</name> people are not so well aware, as we are, how much better it is for children to go to a good school than to pursue their education at home, even under the most skilful private teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Consequently, almost every family in liberal circumstances has a resident governess, an unhappy being, who suffers many of the inconveniences attached to the lot of a servant, without enjoying the solid advantages which ought to accompany servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Upon salaries of <num value="20">twenty</num> or <measure n="30l." type="pounds"><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> a year, many of these ladies are required to make a presentable appearance, and associate, upon a sort of equality, with persons possessing a <num value="100">hundred</num> times their revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Unable to save anything for their declining years, nothing can be conceived more pitiable than the situation of a friendless <name>English</name> governess whom age or infirmities have deprived <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> of employment and of home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>For the benefit of such, an asylum was established in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> several years ago, which, however, had but a feeble life and limited means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><persName n="Nightingale,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0002.00016.00020" reg="nearbymention:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName>, on her return from <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, was informed that the institution was on the point of being given up, owing to its improper management and the slenderness of its endowment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Her aid was sought by the friends of the asylum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>She accepted the laborious post of its superintendent, and she left her beautiful abode in the country, and took up her residence in the establishment in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, to which she g*e both her services and a large part of her income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>For many months she was seldom seen at the entertainments, public and private, which she was formerly in the habit of enjoying; for she was in her place by the bedside of sick, infirm, or dying inmates of the governesses' hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She restored order to its finances; she increased the number of its friends; she improved the arrangements of the interior; and when her health gave way under the excessive labors of her position, and she was compelled to retire to the country, she had the satisfaction of leaving the institution firmly established and well regulated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But the time was at hand when her talents were to be employed upon a grander scale, and when her country was to reap the full result of her study and observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The war with <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In <dateStruct value="1854-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1854-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, ship-loads of troops were leaving <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for the seat of war, and the heart of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> went with them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In all the melancholy history of warlike expeditions, there is no record of <num value="1">one</num> which was managed with such cruel inefficiency as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Everything like foresight, the adaptation of means to ends, knowledge of the climate, knowledge of the human constitution, seemed utterly wanting in those who had charge of sending these <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> <name>British</name> troops to the shores of the <placeName reg="Black Sea" key="tgn,7016619">Black Sea</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rendezvous <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> was at <placeName key="tgn,7005730" n="1.000 2" reg="malta">Malta</placeName>, an island within easy reach of many of the most productive parts of <num value="2">two</num> continents; but even there privation and trouble began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><num value="1">One</num> regiment would find itself destitute of fuel, but overwhelmed with candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In <num value="1">one</num> part of the island there was a superfluity of meat, and no biscuit; while, elsewhere, there was an abundant supply of food for men, but none for horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It afterwards appeared that no <num value="1">one</num> had received anything like exact or timely information, either as to the number of troops expected to land upon the island, or as to the time when they would arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>A curious example of the iron rigidity of routine in the <rs>British</rs> service was this: In the old wars it took <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> for a transport to sail from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7005730" n="1.000 2" reg="malta">Malta</placeName>; but although these troops were all conveyed in steamers, every steamer carried the old allowance of <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> supply of medicines and wines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The chief physician of the force had been <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> in service, and the whole machinery of war worked stiffly from long inaction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>When the troops reached <placeName reg="Gallipoli, Lecce, Puglia" key="tgn,7004089">Gallipoli</placeName>, on the coast of the <rs type="place">Sea of Marmora</rs>, their sufferings really began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had thought to provide interpreters; there were neither carts nor draught animals; so that it frequently happened that a regiment would be on shore several days without having any meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>This new production was the hasty work of a young woman of <num value="22">twenty-two</num>, inspired by these few examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>When <num value="1">one</num> thinks how little an American author finds in the influences around him, even now, to chasten his style or keep him up to any high literary standard, it is plain how very little she could then have found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Accordingly <quote>Hobomok</quote> seems very crude in execution, very improbable in plot, and is redeemed only by a certain earnestness which carries the reader along, and by a sincere attempt after local coloring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Instead of the original lover who heroically yields his place, it is to him that the place is given up. The hero of this self-sacrifice is an Indian, a man of <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> nigh and noble character, whose wife the heroine had consented to become, when almost stunned with the false tidings of her lover's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The least artistic things in the book are these sudden nuptials, and the equally sudden resolution of Hobomok to abandon his wife and child on the reappearance of the original betrothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The success of this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort was at any rate such as to encourage the publication of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> tale in the following year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>This was <quote>The Rebels; or, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> before the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>By the author of Hobomok.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>It was a great advance on its predecessor, with more vigor, more variety, more picturesque grouping, and more animation of style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The historical point was well chosen, and the series of public and private events well combined, with something of that tendency to the over-tragic which is common with young authors, -it is so much easier to kill off superfluous characters than to do anything else with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It compared not unfavorably with <persName n="Cooper,,,,," id="n0202.0003.00043.00082" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s revolutionary novels, and had in <num value="1">one</num> respect a remarkable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Both of these were soon transplanted into <quote>School readers</quote> and books of declamation, and the latter, at least, soon passed for a piece of genuine revolutionary eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>I remember learning it by heart, under that impression, and was really astonished, on recently reading <quote>The Rebels</quote> for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, to discover that the high-sounding periods which I had always attributed to <persName n="Otis,,,,," id="n0202.0003.00043.00084" reg="nearbymention:Otis,James,,,"><surname>Otis</surname></persName> were really to be found in a young lady's romance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The fears must soon have seemed useless, for the young novelist soon became almost a fashionable lion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>They must be perfect in that preliminary requisite before they could proceed to advanced standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It was not quite as in <persName n="Marvell,,,,," id="n0202.0003.00044.00091" reg="mostcommon:Marvell,nomatch:0"><surname>Marvell</surname></persName>'s satire on <placeName reg="Holland, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049915">Holland</placeName>, <quote>Invent a shovel and be a magistrate,</quote> but, Give us our dinner and then, it you please, what is called the intellectual feast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The <quote>Frugal housewife</quote> now lies before me, after <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of abstinence from its appetizing pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The words seem as familiar as when we children used to study them beside <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> the kitchen fire, poring over them as if their very descriptions had power to allay an unquenched appetite or prolong the delights of <num value="1">one</num> satiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>There were the animals in the frontispiece, sternly divided by a dissecting-knife of printer's ink, into sections whose culinary names seemed as complicated as those of surgical science,--chump and spring, sirloin and sperib,--for I faithfully follow the original spelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>There we read with profound acquiescence that <quote>hard gingerbread is good to have in the family,</quote> but demurred at the reason given; <quote>it keeps so well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It never kept well in ours!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>There we all learned that <num value="1">one</num> should be governed in cookery by higher considerations than mere worldly vanity, knowing that <quote>many people buy the upper part of the sparerib of pork, thinking it the most genteel; but the lower part is more sweet and juicy, and there is more meat in proportion to the bone.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Going beyond mere carnal desires, we read also the wholesome directions <quote>to those who are not ashamed of economy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>We were informed that <quote>children could early learn to take care of their own clothes,</quote> --a responsibility at which we shuddered; and also that it was a good thing for children to pick blackberries,--in which we heartily concurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>There, too, we were taught to pick up twine and paper, to write on the backs of old letters, like paper-sparing <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0202.0003.00045.00094" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, and if we had a dollar a day, which seemed a wild supposition, to live on <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure>. We all read, too, with interest, the hints on the polishing of furniture and the education of daughters, and got our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glimpses of political economy from the <quote>Reasons for hard times.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>So varied and comprehensive was the good sense of the book that it surely would have seemed to our childish minds infallible, but for <num value="1">one</num> fatal admission, which through life I have recalled with dismay,the assertion, namely, that <quote>economical people will seldom use preserves.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/><quote>They are unhealthy, expensive, and useless to <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> those who are well.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>This was a sumptuary law, against which the soul of youth revolted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Really the line of asceticism must be drawn somewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>If preserves were to be voted extravagant, economy had lost its charms; let us immediately become spendthrifts, and have a short life and a merry <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The wise counsels thus conveyed in this more-than-cookery-book may naturally have led the way to a <quote>Mother's book,</quote> of more direct exhortation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>This was published in <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, and had a great success, reaching its <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> American edition in <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>, besides <num value="12">twelve</num> <name>English</name> editions and a German translation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Probably it is now out of print, but <num value="1">one</num> may still find at the bookstores the <quote>Girl's own book,</quote> published during the same year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>This is a capital manual of indoor games, and is worth owning by any <num value="1">one</num> who has a houseful of children, or is liable to serve as a Lord of Misrule at <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas</occasion></dateStruct> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>It is illustrated with vignettes by that wayward child of genius, <persName n="Graeter,,Francis,,," id="n0202.0003.00046.00095" reg="default:Graeter,Francis,,,"><foreName>Francis</foreName> <surname>Graeter</surname></persName>, a German, whom <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00046.00096" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName> afterwards described in the <quote>Letters from New York.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Indeed the drollest games which he has delineated in the <quote>Girl's own book</quote> are not so amusing as the unintentional comedy of his attempt at a <quote>Ladies' sewing circle,</quote> which illustrates American life in the <quote>History of woman.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>All these aimed at a popular, not a profound, treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>She was, perhaps, too good a compiler, showing in such work the traits of her brother's mind, and carefully excluding all those airy flights and bold speculations which afterwards seemed her favorite element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The <quote>History of woman,</quote> for instance, was a mere assemblage of facts, beginning and ending abruptly, and with no glimpse of any leading thought or general philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>It was, however, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> American storehouse of information upon that whole question, and no doubt helped the agitation along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Its author evidently looked with distrust, however, on that rising movement for the equality of the sexes, of which <persName n="Wright,,Frances,,," id="n0202.0003.00047.00104" reg="default:Wright,Frances,,,"><foreName>Frances</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> was then the rather formidable leader.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>I have a vague, childish recollection of her next book, <quote>The coronal,</quote> published in <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, which was of rather a fugitive description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The same year brought her to <num value="1">one</num> of those bold steps which made successive eras in her literary life, the publication of her <quote>Appeal for that Class of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0202.0003.00047.00105" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> called Africans.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The name was rather cumbrous, like all attempts to include an epigram in a title-page,--but the theme and the word <quote>Appeal</quote> were enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>It was under the form of an <quote>Appeal</quote> that the colored man, <persName n="Walker,,Alexander,,," id="n0202.0003.00047.00106" reg="default:Walker,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, had thrown a firebrand into Southern society which had been followed by <persName n="Turner,,Nat,,," id="n0202.0003.00047.00107" reg="default:Turner,Nat,,,"><foreName>Nat</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>'s insurrection; and now a literary lady, amid the cultivated circles of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, dared also to <quote>appeal.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>She adds: <quote>Her works were bought with avidity before, but fell into sudden oblivion as soon as she had done a greater deed than writing any of them.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>It is evident that this result was not unexpected, for the preface to the book explicitly recognizes the probable dissatisfaction of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>These words have in them a genuine ring; and the book is really worthy of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>In looking over its pages, after the lapse of <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, it seems incredible that it should have drawn upon her such hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The tone is calm and strong, the treatment systematic, the points well put, the statements well guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The successive chapters treat of the history of slavery, its comparative aspect in different ages and nations, <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> its influence on politics, the profitableness of emancipation, the evils of the colonization scheme, the intellect of negroes, their morals, the feeling against them, and the duties of the community in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>As it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> anti-slavery work ever printed in America in book form, so I have always thought it the ablest; that is, it covered the whole ground better than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>I dreamed that I arose early in the morning and went into my garden, eager to see if the crocus had yet ventured to <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> peep above the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>To my astonishment, that little spot, wnich, the day before, had worn the dreary aspect of winter, was now filled with flowers of every form and hue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Some were diving, some floating, and some undulating on the surface of the sea; and ever as they rose up, the water-drops glittered like gems on the pure white marble.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>She seemed always to be talking radicalism in a greenhouse ; and there were many good people who held her all the more dangerous for her perfumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>There were young men and maidens, also, who looked to her as a teacher, and were influenced for life, perhaps, by what she wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>I knew, for instance, a young lawyer, just entering on the practice of his profession under the most flattering auspices, who withdrew from the courts forever,--wisely or unwisely,--because <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00054.00134" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>'s book had taught him to hate their contests and their injustice.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>This disappointment was no doubt due partly to the fact that the book set itself in decided opposition, unequivocal though gentle, to the prevailing religious impressions of the <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>It is perhaps the best attempt in our language to bring together in a popular form, or indeed in any form, the religious symbols and utterances of different ages, pointing out their analogies and treating all with respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Recognizing all religions as expressions of <num value="1">one</num> universal and ennobling instinct, it was impossible that she should not give dissatisfaction to many sincere minds; had it been possible to avoid this, she would have succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Not only is there no irreverence, but the author is of almost too sympathetic a nature to be called even a rationalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The candor is perfect, and if she has apparently no prejudice in favor of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion, she has certainly what is rare among polemics who tend in her direction,--no prejudice <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> against it. She takes pains &mdash; some readers would say exaggerated pains-to point out its superiority to all others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>In <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00145" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName> published a volume entitled <quote>Autumnal Leaves; Tales and Sketches in Prose and Rhyme.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>It might seem from this title that she regarded her career of action as drawing to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>If so, she was soon undeceived, and the attack of <persName n="Brown,Captain,John,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00146" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> upon <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> aroused her, like many others, from a dream of peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Immediately on the arrest of <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00147" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> she wrote him a brief letter, asking permission to go and nurse him, as he was wounded and among enemies, and as his wife was supposed to be beyond immediate reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>This letter she enclosed in <num value="1">one</num> to <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00148" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>She then went home and packed her trunk, with her husband's full approval, but decided not to go until she heard from <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00149" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, not knowing what his precise wishes might be. She had heard that he had expressed a wish to have the aid of some lawyer not identified with the anti-slavery movement, and she thought he was entitled to the same considerations of policy in regard to a nurse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Meantime <persName n="Brown,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00150" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> was sent for, and promptly arrived; while <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00151" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> wrote <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00152" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName> <num value="1">one</num> of his plain and characteristic letters, declining her offer, and asking her kind aid for his family, which was faithfully given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>But with his letter came <num value="1">one</num> from <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00153" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>,courteous, but rather diplomatic,--and containing some reproof of her expressions of sympathy for the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>To this she wrote an answer, well-worded, and quite effective, which, to her great surprise, soon appeared in the <quote><orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>She wrote to the editor (<dateStruct value="1859-11-10"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>): <quote>I was much surprised to see my correspondence with <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n0202.0003.00058.00154" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> published in your columns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>This correspondence soon led to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>If you do, read there, <q direct="unspecified">Woe unto you hypocrites,</q> and take to yourself, with <num value="2">two</num>-fold damnation, that terrible sentence; for, rest assured, in the day of judgment, it shall be more tolerable for those thus scathed by the awful denunciations of the <name>Son</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> than for you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>This startling commencement &mdash; of which it must be calmly asserted that it comes very near swearing, for a lady &mdash; leads to something like bathos at the end, where <persName n="Mason,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00157" reg="nearbymention:Mason,M.,J.,C.,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> adds in conclusion, <quote>no Southerner ought, after your letters to <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00158" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>, to read a line of your composition, or to touch a magazine which bears your name in its list of contributors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>To begin with doubly-dyed future torments, and come gradually to the climax of <quote>Stop my paper,</quote> admits of no other explanation than that <persName n="Mason,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00159" reg="nearbymention:Mason,M.,J.,C.,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> had dabbled in literature herself, and knew how to pierce the soul of a sister in the trade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>But the great excitement of that period, and the general loss of temper that prevailed, may plead a little in vindication of <persName n="Mason,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00160" reg="nearbymention:Mason,M.,J.,C.,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>'s vehemence, and must certainly enhance the dignity of <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00161" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>'s reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the best things she ever wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>She refuses to dwell on the invectives of her assailant, and only <quote>wishes her well, both in this world and the next.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Nor will she even debate the specific case of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00162" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, whose body was in charge of the courts, and his reputation sure to be in charge of posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/><quote>Men, however great they may be,</quote> she says, <quote>are of small consequence in comparison with principles, and the principle for which <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0202.0003.00059.00163" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> died is the question at issue between us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/><pb id="p.60" n="60"/></p> 
<p>She accordingly proceeds to discuss this question, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> scripturally (following the lead of her assailant), then on general principles; and gives <num value="1">one</num> of her usual clear summaries of the whole argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Now that the excitements of the hour have passed, the spirit of her whole statement must claim just praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>The series of letters was published in pamphlet form in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and secured a wider circulation than anything she ever wrote, embracing some <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> copies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>In return she received many private letters from the slave States, mostly anonymous, and often grossly insulting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Having gained so good a hearing, she followed up her opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>During the same year she printed <num value="2">two</num> small tracts, <quote>The Patriarchal institution,</quote> and <quote>The Duty of Disobedience to the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>;</quote> and then <num value="1">one</num> of her most elaborate compilations, entitled <quote>The Right Way the <rs>Safe Way</rs>, proved by Emancipation in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">British West Indies</placeName> and elsewhere.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>This shows the same systematic and thorough habit of mind with its predecessors; and this business-like way of dealing with facts is hard to reconcile with the dreamy and almost uncontrolled idealism which she elsewhere shows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>In action, too, she has usually shown the same practical thoroughness, and in case of this very book, forwarded copies at her own expense to <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> persons in the slave States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>In <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> she published <quote>Looking towards sunset,</quote> --a very agreeable collection of prose and verse, by various authors, all bearing upon the aspects of old age. This was another of those new directions of literary activity with which she so often surprised her friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The next year brought still another in the <quote>Freedmen's book,</quote> --a collection of short tales and sketches suited to the mental condition of the <rs>Southern</rs> freedmen, and published for their benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>It was sold for that purpose at cost (<measure n="60cents" type="currency">sixty cents</measure>), and a good many copies <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> are still being distributed through teachers and missionaries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Her latest publication, and perhaps (if <num value="1">one</num> might venture to guess) her favorite among the whole series, appeared in <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>,--<quote>A romance of the <rs>Republic</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>It was received with great cordiality, and is in some respects her best fictitious work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The scenes are laid chiefly at the <rs>South</rs>, where she has given the local coloring in a way really remarkable for <num value="1">one</num> who never visited that region,--while the results of slavery are painted with the thorough knowledge of <num value="1">one</num> who had devoted a lifetime to their study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The leading characters are of that type which is now becoming rather common in fiction, because <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> affords none whose situation is so dramatic,--young quadroons educated to a high grade of culture, and sold as slaves after all. All the scenes are handled in a broad spirit of humanity, and betray no trace of that subtle sentiment of caste which runs through and through some novels written ostensibly to oppose caste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The characterization is good, and the events interesting and vigorously handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The defect of the book is a common <num value="1">one</num>,--too large a framework, too many <hi rend="italics">vertebrae</hi> to the plot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Even the established climax of a wedding is a safer experiment than to prolong the history into the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> generation, as here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the story would have been more effective without the conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>But it will always possess value as <num value="1">one</num> of the few really able delineations of slavery in fiction, and the author may well look back with pride on this final offering at that altar of liberty where so much of her life had been already laid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>I have now enumerated all of <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00061.00164" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>'s writings, so far as I can ascertain them,--some having been attributed to her which she did not write,--and have mentioned such of her public acts as are inseparable from her literary career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Beyond this it is not now right to go. It is now nearly <num value="20">twenty</num> <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> years since she left not only the busy world of New York, but almost the world of society, and took up her abode (after a short residence at <placeName reg="West Newton, Allen, Ohio" key="tgn,2082536">West Newton</placeName>), in the house bequeathed to her by her father, at <placeName reg="Wayland, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050839">Wayland, Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>In that quiet village she and her husband have peacefully dwelt, avoiding even friendship's intrusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Into the privacy of that home I have no right to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Times of peace have no historians, and the later career of <persName n="Child,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0003.00062.00165" reg="nearbymention:Child,David,Lee,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName> has had few of what the world calls events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Her domestic labors, her studies, her flowers, and her few guests keep her ever busy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>She has no children of her own,--though, as some <num value="1">one</num> has said, a great many of other people's,--but more than <num value="1">one</num> whom she has befriended has dwelt with her since her retirement, and she comes forth sometimes to find new beneficiaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>But for many of her kindnesses she needs not to leave home, since they are given in the form least to be expected from a literary woman,--that of pecuniary bounty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>If those who labor for the freedmen, in especial, were to testify, they could prove that few households in the country have contributed on a scale so very liberal, in proportion to their means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>During the war this munificence was still farther enhanced in the direction of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>But it is not yet time for the left hand to know what these right hands have done, and I forbear.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/><num value="1">One</num> published letter, however, may serve as a sample of many.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Of course the rancorous pride and prejudice of this country cannot be cured by any short process, not even by lessons so sternly impressive as those of our recent bloody conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>There is cause for great thankfulness that <quote>war Abolitionists</quote> were driven to perform so important a part in the great programme of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>; but their recognition of human brotherhood is rarely of a kind to be trusted in emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>In most cases, it is not <quote><hi rend="italics">skin</hi> deep.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Those who were Abolitionists in the teeth of popular opposition are the only ones who really made the case of the colored people their own; therefore they are the ones least likely to be hoodwinked by sophistry and false pretences now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>To us the present crisis of the country seems more dangreous than that of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The insidiousness of oppressors is always more to be dreaded than their open violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>There can be no reasonable doubt that a murderous feeling toward the colored people prevails extensively at the <rs>South</rs>; and we are far from feeling very sure that a large party could not be rallied at the <rs>North</rs> in favor of restoring slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>We have ho idea that it ever <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be restored; but if we would avert the horrors of another war, more dreadful than the last, we must rouse up and keep awake a public sentiment that will compel politicians to do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>This we consider the appropriate and all-important work of the old Anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">slavery Society</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The British Anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">slavery Society</orgName> deserted their post too soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>She is <num value="1">one</num> of those prominent instances in our literature, of persons born for the pursuits of pure intellect, whose intellects were yet balanced by their hearts, and both absorbed in the great moral agitations of the age. <quote>My natural inclinations,</quote> she once wrote to me, <quote>drew me much more strongly towards literature and the arts than towards reform, and the weight of conscience was needed to turn the scale.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>She has doubtless gained in earnestness far more than she has lost in popularity, in wealth, or even in artistic culture; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> losses count for little, and the last may not be due to her advocacy of reforms alone, but to the crude condition, as respects even literary art, which yet marks us all. In a community of artists, she would have belonged to that class, for she had that instinct in her soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>But she was placed where there was as yet no exacting literary standard; she wrote better than most of her contemporaries, and well <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> enough for her public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>She did not, therefore, win that intellectual immortality which only the very best writers command, and which few <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0202.0003.00065.00175" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> have attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>But she won a meed which she would value more highly,--that warmth of sympathy, that mingled gratitude of intellect and heart which men give to those who have faithfully served their day and generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>No rural retirement can hide her from the prayers of those who were ready to perish, when they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> knew her; and the love of those whose lives she has enriched from childhood will follow her fading eyes as they look towards sunset, and, after her departing, will keep her memory green. </p></div1>

Not that she is wanting in a poet's sensuous delight in bright colors, rich textures, beautiful, refined faces, grand music and noble church-architecture, but that in the lives of the poor, colorless, homely, ungraceful, almost blindly aspiring and devout, there is something that moves her heart more tenderly and yet more solemnly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>In <quote>the low, sad music of humanity</quote> there is something that touches a higher than the poetic sense; and to her the humblest <name>Christian</name> soul, simple and ignorant, but trusting and loving, is a grander temple of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> than the <rs type="place">Cathedral of Milan</rs>, with its wondrous Alp-like peaks of snowy architecture, sentinelled with sculptured saints.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>At her grave I learned my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson of a bursting grief that has never been forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Let none say that the aged die unloved or unmourned by the young.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>It must have been an influence of great power which such a character wielded over such a nature; and we cannot wonder that, long years after that hallowed intimacy, we find the grateful child thus recording her remembrance of it: <quote>The cream of all my happiness was a loving intercourse with venerable old age.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Nor can we deny her the dutiful Joy of dedicating <num value="1">one</num> of her earliest publications, as <quote>an offering <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> of gratitude to her whose influence, like a golden thread, had run through the whole woof of my life.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>It was under influences like these that her life had its dawning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Exceedingly sensitive and impressible, she readily responded to their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>They found her a keen observer, and a very rapid learner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Her infancy seems to have been like the later childhood of most girls, and her girlhood wore the thoughtfulness and reached the attainments of ordinary womanhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>The insight into this earliest period of her life, which her <quote>Letters of life</quote> so artlessly give us, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most curious pages in our autobiographic literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>We have here, perhaps, the most unaffected and childlike prattle about child-life, in the language of doting old age. Possibly there may be something excessive in the coloring given to the whole picture; but surely we can afford to let the pen of old age use the freedom which a warm heart, warming anew amid the scenes and play-places of its young life, might dictate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>Let the venerated authoress, if in her deep joy she recalls the events which seemed so important to her young fancy, tell the whole story, which once she might have hesitated to do, and which other authors, more careful to prune their thoughts to the accepted proprieties, would not assuredly have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>It certainly cannot harm us to be made, once in our lives, familiar in letters with the very precocities, if you will, which are so often seen in bright children, yet which we do not usually elevate to the dignity of the printed page.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>If she speaks of the little attempts at conversation made in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of her life, have we not all heard and been charmed with hearing the same thing in our own little ones?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>If she details even the prattle, and the occasional wise and overscholarly sayings or fancies of her <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> summer among the flowers, why not give her credit for what, though perhaps not <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> very common, is still plainly possible to a child of gifts, especially if she has spent her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> under the most helpful of influences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>It need not be counted an offence if she tell us over what nobody else will be likely to tell us, -the whole story of her doll-teaching and training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>It is a pretty picture which that same scene makes when acted in all of our homes, and why should not its sketch, whether by the pencil of the artist or the pen of the writer, charm us too?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>But is there not, also, in this the very best of sense?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>How it aids us to understand the woman, to see the little <num value="1">one</num> with her dolls around her, and hear her begin there her work of persuasion and authority!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>It instructs as well as charms us to visit the artless child in her <quote>spacious garret;</quote> to note her curious search among its gathered household treasures; to find her settling herself down like the bee to its flower-food, as she finds an old hymn-book there; to see her hearty love for the <quote>large black horse,</quote> <quote>the red-coat cows,</quote> <quote>the crowing, brooding, and peeping poultry,</quote> and the <quote>pliant pussy</quote> which sat in her lap or sported by her side, and which was <quote>as a sister</quote> to her. It will instruct us, where we shall need light, to roam awhile with the laughing babe and child, <quote>from garden to garden;</quote> to run with her <quote>at full speed through the alleys;</quote> to recline by her side, <quote>when wearied, in some shaded recess,</quote> or even on the <quote>mow of hay in the large, lofty barn,</quote> where we can together <quote>watch the quiet cows over their fragrant food;</quote> and then to sit down with her at the family table, and taste with her of the bread so sweet, <quote>made in capacious iron basins.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>Suppose, in this way, we learn how early and how regular her meals were; how uniform and simple the diet on which she was reared; and how exact and respectful and decorous the behavior of that hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Do not all of these lessons explain the character which they so certainly help to form?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>And so we may well thank the authoress of <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> that she allowed herself to recall, <hi rend="italics">for</hi> our <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> delight and instruction, those germinal forces of her favored childhood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>Let us now follow this child, as she prepares herself for the life-work before her. At <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of age we find her in the school nearest to the house of her parents; and we only learn of that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school, that its <quote>spelling-classes</quote> were the chief delight of the child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Trivial as this fact is, it gives us no unmeaning hint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Her <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> teacher, a gentleman, perhaps the teacher of the winter school, won the child to the use of the pen, and laid the foundation of that distinct, print-like chirography which was so serviceable to her whole future career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Next, the teacher of needle-work does her good service by starting her well in this feminine art, of which she made later the best of use. And now comes the young ladies' school, under an English lady of varied accomplishment; and here she makes a good beginning in music and painting and embroidery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>And here, too, we get valuable hints, and it would well repay us, had we time, to watch the child in the beginning of her art-life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>It was full of meaning,--that extemporized studio at home, that <quote>piece of gamboge,</quote> that <quote>fragment of indigo, begged of the washer-woman,</quote> those coffee-grounds &mdash; to give the ambered brown, and those child-experiments, again and again repeated, to secure desired tints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>We may note, too, about this time, how the literary taste and enthusiasm of the child was aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>How life-like was its beginning She started a story, which the record does not finish; for they all said it was too much for her. She was <quote>only just <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Next we find her in the school of a graduate of <placeName reg="Dublin, Pulaski, Virginia" key="tgn,2111523">Dublin</placeName>, and here she makes rapid progress in mathematics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>Her next step forward, in the school on the <rs>Green</rs>, under an educated and veteran teacher, places her at the head of the reading-classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>Then, under the training of <persName n="Perit,Mister,Pelatiah,,," id="n0202.0005.00091.00289" reg="default:Perit,Pelatiah,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Pelatiah</foreName> <surname>Perit</surname></persName>, who became so eminent among the business men of the country, <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> she spent another year of successful study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Pursuing still the <rs>English</rs> classics and Latin, she finished in her <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> year her school-life at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Then followed a course of domestic training in the duties of house-keeping, yet not so pressingly as to hinder the private study of the <rs>Latin</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>For the higher ornamental branches she spent parts of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> in <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>; and, with more than ordinary mental activity and attainment, she takes leave of her school-life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>Yet, such was her thirst for learning, that nothing could hinder her studies; and we find her, with the enthusiasm of a scholar, devoting her later girlhood to the study of even the original <rs>Hebrew</rs> of the <rs>Christian Scriptures</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>And now begins her career as teacher,--a life which she seems to have chosen scarcely more for want of something to do than from love of teaching itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>Her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> experiment had been made in her father's house, and the result confirmed her purpose to make it her life-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>In her <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> year, in company with <persName n="Hyde,Miss,Nancy,M.,," id="n0202.0005.00092.00290" reg="expanded:Hyde,Nancy,Maria,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Nancy</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Hyde</surname></persName>, a very intimate friend, she opened a select school for girls in <placeName reg="Chelsea, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015012">Chelsea</placeName>, now <placeName reg="Norwich City">Norwich City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Her interest in the work was very great, and her success no less so. We can readily accept her later testimony that she found her daily employment <quote>less a toil than privilege.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>But, through the influence of <persName n="Wadsworth,Mister,Daniel,,," id="n0202.0005.00092.00291" reg="default:Wadsworth,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, she was induced to establish for herself a private school for girls in that city; and, in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, she entered upon its duties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>During the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> she remained in this school she won a twofold reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>Her success as teacher was well-nigh unparalleled for the times, and deservingly so; while her influence over the social circles of the city had become no less marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Her influence over her pupils was something wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>They loved her with a love which nothing could repress; and their devotion was as true and lasting as their love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>What testimony to the strength of her hold upon <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> them those annual reunions on their commencement day furnishes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Even long years after they had become scattered over the land, those days were held sacred in their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>And when their little ones began to gather about them, they, too, were taken to the hallowed place, that on them also might fall the sweet influence which had so long blessed their mothers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>But, from the very beginning of her life in <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, she made for herself a place in the confidence and affections of the people, which every successive year only served to confirm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>She became, in the just language of as high authority as the venerable <persName n="Goodrich,,S.,G.,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00292" reg="default:Goodrich,S.,G.,,"><foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Goodrich</surname></persName>, <quote>the presiding genius of its young social circle,</quote> and she was never called in her long career to vacate that post of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>It was while thus winning her way as teacher that she also began her public literary life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>At the urgent request of her friend, <persName n="Wadsworth,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00293" reg="nearbymention:Wadsworth,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName>, she consented to issue her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, entitled, <quote>Pieces in prose and verse.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>This work was printed in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, at the expense of <persName n="Wadsworth,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00294" reg="nearbymention:Wadsworth,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>And the list of subscribers, which was also printed, indicates thus early the reputation which newspaper publicity had given her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>But another event soon interrupts her career as teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/><persName n="Sigourney,,Charles,,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00295" reg="default:Sigourney,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sigourney</surname></persName>, a merchant of the city, a gentleman of wealth and literary culture and high social position, solicits and wins her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Their marriage was celebrated in the <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal church</orgName> of her native town, in the early summer of <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>. <persName n="Sigourney,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00296" reg="nearbymention:Sigourney,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sigourney</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Huguenot, Elbert, Georgia" key="tgn,2405698">Huguenot</placeName> descent, was already a communicant in the <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal church</orgName>; and, on her marriage, <persName n="Sigourney,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00297" reg="nearbymention:Sigourney,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Sigourney</surname></persName>, who, since <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>, had been a devoted <name>Christian</name> and a member of the <orgName n="Congregational Church" type="church">Congregational church</orgName>, felt it to be her privilege and duty to transfer her membership to the church to which her husband belonged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>This marriage threw upon <persName n="Sigourney,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0005.00093.00298" reg="nearbymention:Sigourney,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Sigourney</surname></persName> the care of the <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> <num value="3">three</num> children of her husband by a former wife; and that care was assumed with a singular devotion to their comfort and welfare; and in this field only did she find room henceforth for her gifts as teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>But both her position at the head of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> circle in the leading metropolis of the <rs>State</rs>, and her means, and the culture of her husband, conspired to encourage her in the literary field in which she was now winning such a triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Besides the volume printed in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, in <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> she had published her <quote>Life and writings of <persName n="Hyde,,Nancy,Maria,," id="n0202.0005.00094.00299" reg="default:Hyde,Nancy,Maria,,"><foreName>Nancy</foreName> <foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Hyde</surname></persName>,</quote> an interesting tribute to the memory of her most intimate friend and fellow-teacher; and during the year of her marriage appeared, also, <quote>The square table,</quote> a pamphlet designed as a corrective of what were deemed the harmful tendencies of <quote><persName n="Arthur,,,,," id="n0202.0005.00094.00300" reg="mostcommon:Arthur,nomatch:0"><surname>Arthur</surname></persName>'s round table,</quote> which was then exciting considerable attention in the community.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>From this date to that of her death our record must be that of an earnest woman, filling up every hour of her day with its allotted duty, cheerfully and nobly done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Few women have been so diligent workers, few have maintained such fervency of spirit, and few have, in all their working, no faithfully served the <rs>Lord</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Her position, that of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> wife and step-mother, has not always been found an easy <num value="1">one</num> to fill; yet, even with the temptations which her literary tastes might be supposed to offer, she could never be justly reproached for neglecting any home-duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Bound to her friends with no ordinary ties of affection, she lived, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Even her literary life is most crowded with its witnesses to her home-love, and indeed was largely its result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>She worked, and wrote, and prayed, that she might faithfully meet this prime claim upon her heart and life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>We cannot follow, in detail, this busy and painstaking career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>We find her at the head of her household, which at times was large, shrinking from no burden or self-denial <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> needed in her work,--living to see her <num value="2">two</num> step-daughters educated and settled in life, and their brother, at the age of <num value="45">forty-five</num>, consigned to a consumptive's grave; to educate her own daughter and son, and then, just on the verge of a promising manhood, to follow him, too, to his grave; to care for both her own parents, until, in a good old age, she might tenderly hand them down to their last rest; to follow her beloved and honored husband to his grave; to give her own only daughter away in acceptable marriage; and then to settle herself down, joyful and trustful yet, in her own home, vacated indeed of her loved ones, but filled still with precious mementos of their love, until her own change should come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>These <measure n="46years" type="date">forty-six years</measure>, between her marriage and her death, were mainly spent at her home in <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Her travels were chiefly those of brief journeys through the <rs>Eastern</rs> and Middle States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Once she visited <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and once crossed the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, visiting within the year the chief points of attraction in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>The rest of those <measure n="46years" type="date">forty-six years</measure> were most industriously employed in her own loved home, filled up with domestic duties or with literary and benevolent work; and it is safe to say that few women have ever worked to better account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>She won universal respect and love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>The poor and the rich, the ignorant and the educated, alike found in her that which delighted and charmed them; and so she came to occupy a place in their affections which they accorded to no other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>But, doubtless, it will be as a literary woman that she will be most widely known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>And no estimate of her career which leaves out of the account the character and value of her writings can do justice to her memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>Beginning in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, and closing with her posthumous <quote>Letters of life</quote> in <dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, her published writings numbered <num value="57">fifty-seven</num> volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Besides these, our newspaper and magazine literature must have furnished nearly as much more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Her correspondence, <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> not published, amounting to nearly <num value="1700">one thousand seven hundred</num> letters annually for several years, must have exceeded largely these printed writings; so that she must have been <num value="1">one</num> of the most voluminous writers of her age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>We have not space for a critical analysis of her writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>We would simply indicate their aim and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Whatever may be said of their artistic execution, of <num value="1">one</num> thing we are sure, that their spirit and aim are as noble as ever inspired human literature; and the world has already accepted them as a worthy offering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>A sharp critical judgment must agree with <persName n="Sigourney,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0005.00096.00301" reg="nearbymention:Sigourney,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Sigourney</surname></persName>'s own decision, that she wrote too much for highest success, both in invention and style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>But when we stop to ask why she wrote so much, we shall find our answer in the very elements of her character, which contributed most to her eminence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>Her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> published volume reveals with great clearness at least these <num value="2">two</num> qualities of the writer: the strength of her affections, and her equally strong sense of duty to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>We feel that she wrote what her kind heart prompted, that she might please or aid those who seemed to her to have just claims upon her. Instead of using the precious moments on the mere style of her expression, she was ever hurrying along on some urgent call of affection or duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>She could not stop to think of her literary reputation when some dear friend was pleading at her heart, or some sorrowing soul needed to be comforted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>More than almost any other writer of the day, she wrote not for herself, but for others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>And it is precisely here that we find the real key, both to whatever faults of style her writings may betray, and to the very best success of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>For, while she greatly blessed the multitudes for whom she so rapidly wrote, we cannot but notice, also, how in her successive works, she is gaining both in the force and beauty of her style.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>We see on almost every page of her writings how tender <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> her spirit, how sensitive her sympathy was. From the beginning, her affections, sanctified by a Christian purpose, took the lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>We know that it was her greatest <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="couplet"><l part="F">joy to raise</l> <l>The trembler from the shade,</l> <l>To bind the broken, and to heal .</l> <l>The wounds she never made.</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>But we must not dwell on these charming witnesses to the tenderness of her loving heart.* It is easy to see that <num value="1">one</num> so ruled, would not regard the mere style of her expression of highest value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>And yet it would do injustice to <persName n="Sigourney,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0005.00097.00302" reg="nearbymention:Sigourney,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Sigourney</surname></persName>, to leave out of the account the care and painstaking, with which she sought to make her writings most effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>We know she must have sought ease and fluency as well as exactness and vigor of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Her writings abound in witnesses innumerable to these graces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The call made upon her pen from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> magazines of the day, and from the more solid works issuing from our best publishing-houses, of itself testifies to the great merit even of her style.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>No critic can read that beautiful poem on the <quote>Death of an infant,</quote> commencing with <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/></p><l>Death found strange beauty on that polished brow,</l> <l>And dashed it out,</l></quote> without feeling that none but a true poet, practised in the art, could have written it. We might instance her <quote>Scottish weaver,</quote> <quote>Breakfast,</quote> <quote>Birthday of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0202.0005.00097.00303" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>,</quote> <quote>My stuffed Owl,</quote> <quote><placeName key="tgn,1100385" n="1.000 10" reg="Old Fort Niagara, Niagara, New York">Niagara</placeName>,</quote> and hundreds of other poems, in all of which may be found passages of great beauty and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>We are sure we cannot afford, these many years, to let those graceful, and at times exquisite, gems, drop out of our literature; nor can we doubt that their author will continue to rank high even among the poets of her age. <pb id="p.98" n="98"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>Such huge bodies of water mark out the country through which they run as the future abode of the most extensive commerce and greatest maritime power in the universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> diary, we find those elements developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>Disappointment,--the greatest a woman can know,--the discovery that her mate is not her equal, had imparted a premature maturity and an unusual depth of reflection to the matron of <num value="27">twenty-seven</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>Her record of this winter's residence in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, among her husband's slaves, is the best contribution ever made by an individual, to our knowledge, of the practical working of the slave system in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> of her friends cautioned her not to go down to her husband's plantation <quote>prejudiced</quote> against what she was to find there.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>She was disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>She discovered that slavery was <hi rend="italics">all</hi> cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>The very kindness shown to slaves did but aggravate their sufferings, because that kindness was necessarily fitful and capricious, and was liable at any moment to terminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>With those fresh and honest eyes of hers she looked through all the sophistry of the masters, and saw the system exactly as it was.. They told her, for example, that the large families of the slaves were a proof of their good treatment and welfare.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/><quote>No such thing,</quote> she replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/><quote>If you will reflect for a moment upon the overgrown families of the half-starved <name>Irish</name> peasantry and <name>English</name> manufacturers, you will agree with me <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> that these prolific shoots by no means necessarily spring from a rich or healthy soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>Peace and plenty are certainly causes of human increase, and so is recklessness; and this, I take it, is the impulse in the instance of the <rs>English</rs> manufacturer, the <name>Irish</name> peasant, and the negro slave. . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>The relation indeed resembles, as far as circumstances can possibly make it do so, the short-lived connection between the animal and its young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>The father, having neither authority, power, responsibility, nor charge in his children, is, of course, as among brutes, the least attached to his offspring; the mother, by the natural law which renders the infant dependent on her for its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year's nourishment, is more so; but, as neither of them is bound to educate or to support their children, all the unspeakable tenderness and solemnity, all the rational, and all the spiritual grace and glory of the connection is lost, and it becomes mere breeding, bearing, suckling, and there an end. But it is not only the absence of the conditions which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has affixed to the relation which tends to encourage the reckless increase of the race; they enjoy, by means of numerous children, certain positive advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>In the first place, every woman who is pregnant, as soon as she chooses to make the fact known to the overseer, is relieved of a certain portion of her work in the field, which lightening of labor continues, of course, as long as she is so burdened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>On the birth of a child certain additions of clothing and an additional weekly ration are bestowed on the family; and these matters, small as they may seem, act as powerful inducements to creatures who have none of the restraining influences actuating them which belong to the parental relation among all other people, whether civilized or savage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>Moreover, they have all of them a most distinct and perfect knowledge of <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> their value to their owners as property; and a woman thinks, and not much amiss, that the more frequently she adds to the number of her master's live-stock by bringing new slaves into the world, the more claims she will have upon his consideration and good-will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>This was perfectly evident to me from the meritorious air with which the women always made haste to inform me of the number of children they had borne, and the frequent occasions on which the older slaves would direct my attention to their children, exclaiming, <q direct="unspecified">Look, missis!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>Her husband's negroes were considered fortunate by those upon surrounding plantations, and yet almost everything that she saw and heard during her residence among them filled her with grief and horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>What surprised her very much was, the low <hi rend="italics">physical</hi> condition of the colored people, and the great mortality among the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>This was partly owing to insufficient and innutritious food, but chiefly to the incessant childbearing of the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth will speak, and, especially, a woman's mouth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>This appearance naturally connected itself with her death, when that occurred soon afterward; and thenceforth the family have lent a ready ear to narrations of spiritual (as distinguished from material) presence, which to many, if not most, persons are simply incredible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>The youngest of the family, named Elmina, was a woman of signal beauty of mind and person, whose poetic as well as her general capacities were of great promise; but she married, while yet young, <persName n="Swift,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0009.00166.00550" reg="mostcommon:Swift,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Swift</surname></persName>, a Cincinnati merchant, and thenceforward, absorbed in other cares, gave little attention to literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>She had also the rare quality of discerning both needs of the <rs>American</rs> mind,--originality and culture,--and no <num value="1">one</num>, except <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00188.00660" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, has done so much to bridge the passage from a tame and imitative epoch to a truly indigenous literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>Most of us are either effeminated by education, or are left crude and rough by the want of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>It was, therefore, an event in the history of our literature, when a woman thus eminently gifted became the literary critic of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <name>Tribune</name></orgName>, --then; and perhaps still, the journal possessing the most formative influence over the most active class of <orgName type="college" n="American college">American</orgName> minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>There were, of course, drawbacks upon her fitness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>She was sometimes <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> fantastic in her likings; so are most fastidious people; so is <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00189.00661" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>She might be egotistical and overbearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>But she was honest and true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>It was apt to be the strong, not the weak, whom she assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/>Her greatest errors were committed in vindicating those whom others attacked, or in dethroning popular favorites to make room for obscurer merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>A different course would have made her life smoother and her memory less noble.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>In her day, as now, there were few well-trained writers in the country, and they had little leisure for criticism; so that work was chiefly left to boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>The few exceptions were cynics, like <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00189.00662" reg="mostcommon:Poe,nomatch:0"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>, or universal flatterers, like <persName n="Willis,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00189.00663" reg="mostcommon:Willis,Sara,,,:4"><surname>Willis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Griswold,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00189.00664" reg="mostcommon:Griswold,A.,W.,,:1"><surname>Griswold</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>Into the midst of these came a woman with no gifts for conciliation, with no personal attractions, with a habit of saying things very explicitly and of using the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> person singular a good deal too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>In her volume of <quote>Papers on literature and art,</quote> published in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, there is a preface of <num value="3">three</num> pages in which this unpleasant grammatical form occurs just <num value="50">fifty</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>This is very characteristic; she puts the worst side foremost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>The preface once ended, the rest of the book seems wise and gentle, and only egotistic here and there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>Or at least, nothing need be excepted from this claim, except the article on <quote>American literature</quote> --the only essay in the book which had not been previously published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>Gentle this was not always, nor could it be; and she furthermore apologized for it in the preface (wisely or unwisely), as prepared too hastily for a theme so difficult, and claimed only that it was <quote>written with sincere and earnest feelings, and from a mind that cares for nothing but what is permanent and essential.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/><quote>It should, then,</quote> she adds, <quote>have some merit, if only in the power of suggestion.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>It certainly has such merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>It is remarkable, after <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, to see how many of her judgments have been confirmed by the public <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>How well, for instance, she brought forth from obscurity the then forgotten genius of <persName n="Brown,,Charles,Brockden,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00665" reg="default:Brown,Charles,Brockden,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>Brockden</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>; how just were her delineations of <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00666" reg="mostcommon:Bryant,nomatch:0"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Willis,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00667" reg="mostcommon:Willis,Sara,,,:4"><surname>Willis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00668" reg="mostcommon:Dana,Elizabeth,,,:1"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>, <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00669" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>; how well she described <persName n="Prescott,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00670" reg="mostcommon:Prescott,Harriet,,,:2"><surname>Prescott</surname></persName>, then at his culmination,--his industry, his wealth of material, his clear and elegant arrangement, and his polished tameness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>So much the public could endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>It was when she touched <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00671" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00672" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,James,Russell,,:1"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> that her audience, or that portion of it which dwelt round <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, grew clamorously indignant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>In reverting, after <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, to these criticisms, <num value="1">one</num> perceives that the community must have grown more frank or less sensitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>There seems no good reason why they should have made so much stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>There is no improper personality in them, and, though they may be incorrect, they are not unfair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>She frankly confesses to <quote>a coolness towards <persName n="Longfellow,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00673" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>, in consequence of the exaggerated praise bestowed upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>She then goes on to point out the atmosphere of overpraise which has always surrounded this poet,--says that t his is not justly chargeable on himself,,but on his admirers, publishers, and portrait-painters; and adds in illustration that the likeness of him in the illustrated edition of his works suggests the impression of a <quote>dandy <persName n="Pindar,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00674" reg="mostcommon:Pindar,nomatch:0"><surname>Pindar</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>This phrase, I remember, gave great offence at the time; yet, on inspection of that rather smirking portrait, it proves to be a fair description; and she expressly disclaims all application of the phrase to the poet himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>She defends him from <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00190.00675" reg="mostcommon:Poe,nomatch:0"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>'s charges of specific plagiarism, and points out, very justly, that these accusations only proceed from something imitative and foreign in many <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> of his images and in the atmosphere of much of his verse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>She says, as many have felt, that he sees nature, whether human or external, too much through the windows of literature, and finally assigns him his place as <quote>a man of cultivated taste, delicate though not deep feeling, and some, though not much, poetic force.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>This may not be an adequate statement of the literary claims of <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00191.00676" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>; but it certainly does not differ so widely from the probable final award as to give just ground for complaint against the critic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>It is also recorded by <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0010.00191.00677" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> that she only consented to review <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00191.00678" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s poems with the greatest reluctance, and at the editors particular request, <quote>assigning the wide divergence of her views of poetry from those of the author and his school as the reason.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>Towards <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName> she showed more asperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>Yet there was nothing personal in her remarks, even here; there was simply an adverse literary criticism, conveyed with a slight air of arrogance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>To preface an opinion with <quote>We must declare it, though to the grief of some friends and the disgust of more,</quote> was undoubtedly meant for a deprecatory and regretful expression; but it had a sort of pompous effect that did not soften the subsequent brief verdict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>She declared him <quote>absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy,</quote> with the addition that <quote>his interest in the moral questions of the day had supplied the want of vitality in himself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>Even this last statement was far too strong, no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Yet it will now be admitted by <placeName reg="Lowell, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013975">Lowell</placeName>'s warmest admirers that his poetic phases have been singularly coincident with his phases of moral enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>His early development of genius was united with extreme radicalism of position; then followed many years, comprising the prime of his life, when both his genius and his enthusiasm seemed quiescent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>It was the unforeseen stimulus of the war which made him again put on his singing robes, for that <quote>Commemoration <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> Ode,</quote> which is incomparably the greatest of his poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>All this vindicated in some degree the discernment, though it could not justify the sweeping manner of <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0202.0010.00192.00679" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName>'s criticism; and her tone of arrogance is more than counterbalanced by the fierce personalities with which the poet retaliated upon her in the <quote>Fable for critics.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>The criticisms on <name>English</name> poets in this collection seem to me singularly admirable; they take rank with those of <persName n="Browning,,Elizabeth,Barrett,," id="n0202.0010.00192.00680" reg="default:Browning,Elizabeth,Barrett,,"><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <foreName>Barrett</foreName> <surname>Browning</surname></persName>, in her <quote>Essays on the poets.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>There is much beside, in these rich volumes; a brief criticism on <quote>Hamlet,</quote> for instance, in <num value="1">one</num> of the dialogues, which is worthy to take rank with those of <persName n="Jameson,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0010.00192.00690" reg="mostcommon:Jameson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Jameson</surname></persName>; and an essay on <quote><persName n="MacKINTOSHintosh,Sir,James,,," id="n0202.0010.00192.00691" reg="default:MacKINTOSHintosh,James,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>MacKINTOSHintosh</surname></persName>,</quote> which, in calm completeness and thorough workmanship, was her best work, as it was <num value="1">one</num> of her latest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>The only complaint I should make in regard to this book is founded on its title, <quote>Papers on literature and art.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>With art, save as included in literature, she should not have meddled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>If, however, she was thus tempted beyond her sphere, it was less perhaps from vanity than because she yielded to the demand popularly made on all our intellectual laborers, that they should scatter themselves as much as possible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>As to this whole charge of vanity, indeed, there have certainly been great exaggerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>She had by inheritance certain unpleasant tricks of manner, which gave the impression, as <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0202.0010.00194.00695" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> said, of <quote>a rather mountainous <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Me.</placeName></quote> She was accustomed to finding herself among inferiors, and lorded it a little in her talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>All these influences marred her, in some degree; and those whom her criticisms wounded, made the most of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>But though her most private diaries and letters have been set before the public, I do not see that anything has been produced which shows a petty or conceited disposition, while she has certainly left on record many noble disclaimers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>A woman who could calmly set aside all the applauses she received for her wonderful conversation by pointing out to herself that this faculty <quote>bespoke a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate mind,</quote> could not have had her head turned by vanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>At another time she wrote in her diary, <quote>When I look at my papers, I feel as if I had never had a thought that was worthy the attention of any but myself; and 'tis only when, on talking with people, I find I tell them what they did not know, that my confidence at all returns.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>The self-devotion of her closing years brought no surprise to those who remembered how she had sacrificed her most cherished plans for the sake of educating her brothers; and how she had through all her life been ready to spend money and toil for those around her, when she had little money and no health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>She gave to the community, also, the better boon of moral courage; it showed itself most conspicuously in the telling of unwelcome truth; but it was mianifested also in heroic endurance, since she was, as <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0010.00195.00696" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName> has testified, <quote>all her life the victim of disease and pain.</quote></p>

<p>A woman should dress so as to be grateful to her husband's eye, I grant; nay, I enjoin; and he is under equally strong obligations to dress so as to be grateful to her eye. I have heard a woman say variety in dress is necessary in order that her husband may not be wearied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>To woman rather than to man, and to woman in this century rather than in any former <num value="1">one</num>, belongs the credit of preparing the way for the future liberal education of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>Heretofore the aids to her education have been few and defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>A really liberal education for her has hardly been possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>Collegiate and University courses have been closed against her; so that if occasionally a woman has succeeded in gaining the reputation of a scholar, it has been mainly due to her own unaided exertions,--a triumph of her personal genius and will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>We have reached a state of public sentiment now, however, which, partially, at least, accords to woman the right to enter any field of literature or art, which she may choose; and, to a certain extent, we are furnishing her with such aids as for generations have been furnished for her brothers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>Already we are gathering excellent fruits from this advance made in our theory and system of woman's culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>Our multiplied young ladies' seminaries and collegiate institutions, and still more our colleges and professional schools in which the <num value="2">two</num> sexes are, to their mutual benefit, prosecuting together the studies which were formerly confined to only <num value="1">one</num> of them, are important results already attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Still maturer fruit we have, in the increasing numbers of <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> thoroughly educated women who are now prepared to occupy chairs of instruction, once filled only by the most honored alumni of our best universities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>We are coming to welcome woman's taste, and tact, and power, into every department of our educational work, and we have much to hope from the new element thus introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>Without attempting to name, even, the many eminent women whose personal attainments and services have contributed largely towards this result, we shall, in this chapter, briefly sketch the career of only <num value="2">two</num> of them, who, by common consent, must be held to rank as pioneers in this most excellent work.</p> 
<div2 id="c.14.2" type="section" n="c.14.2">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> among the women, still living, who have attained high rank as professional educators, must stand the name at the head of this sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>And this position <persName n="Willard,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00273.00963" reg="nearbymention:Willard,Emma,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName> deserves, whether we regard her as a pioneer, creating for herself, and her sex, a new place and rank among educators, or simply as an earnest and skilful worker, rendering eminent service in this field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>That she is fairly entitled to this enminence among the gifted women of our day, a very brief sketch of her career will fully show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>The story itself is a true epic, needing only the simplest recital,--its main facts being more exciting than any fiction we should dare to invent.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>The home they made for their children was just the home in which gifted children would like to be reared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>And this home, more than anything else determined the character and success of <persName><foreName>Emma</foreName></persName>, their <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> child, whose record we are now to trace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>Being <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="17">seventeen</num> of her father's children, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="10">ten</num> whom her own mother had borne him, she early found in this large circle <num value="1">one</num> important means of her training.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>Let us enter that rural home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>We will take an early evening hour, about mid-winter, and for the date it may be anywhere between her birthday and the year <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>, the date of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt to teach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>The scene we shall witness will best prepare us for what we are to learn of the great work of her future life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>The children have already spent their <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> in their school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>They have severally done up the chores which, in those primitive times, our children were supposed able to do. They had just finished with thanksgiving their relishful supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>The youngest of them have already dropped away into the sweet sleep of their night's rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>The huge wood fire glows warmly upon that happy home-circle gathering around it. The older children, all aglow with a joyful interest, finish the little story of their day's fun, and frolic, and work, and successively test their skill in reading aloud a few well-chosen passages from the selectest authors of the day. Then father and mother, no less joyful, add the benediction of their few words of approval, and their timely hints for correction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>And now, for another half hour, or hour, if this be deemed needed, the father and mother-blessed mentors they!--read, in their turn, aloud, and with the skill which long practice has given them, their lessons for <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> themselves and their little flock.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>Happy, blessed group, for whose early years such a home is furnished!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>What child of gifts could fail of largest fruitage, whose bloom is amid such home sunshine and warmth?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>Let us take <num value="1">one</num> more lesson from that <persName n="Worthington,,,,," id="n0202.0014.00275.00967" reg="mostcommon:Worthington,nomatch:0"><surname>Worthington</surname></persName> home; and let the mother of the family be our teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>Notice with what womanly ingenuity she makes their slender resources ample for all their home wants, and even for the gratification of a cultivated home taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>Notice how thoughtfully she provides for the poor family out under the hill, to whom the warm breakfast she sends them, makes the only glad hour of their poverty-stricken home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>And then, when all these home and neighborhood duties are so skilfully discharged, she is not satisfied until she has given her children a lesson of thoughtful kindness to the little birds that are to sing for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>The refuse wool, which can be of no use to the family, she teaches her little ones how to leave about on the bushes for a hint to the charming warblers to build their fleece-lined nests near to the human home which she would have blest by their sweet singing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>And thus, this admirable home-training, with some <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of study in the village academy, then just opened under a skilful teacher, brought <persName><foreName>Emma</foreName></persName> forward to the beginning of her life-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>She had used her opportunities well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>She had been required to think and plan for herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>Her powers of observation and her practical judgment had been equally taxed and improved; $nd it is not too much to say, that, in literary attainment, and still more, in ability to learn, she had exceeded her years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>A young lady of <num value="14">fourteen</num>, who, on a cold night in mid-winter, wrapping herself in her cloak, <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> with the horse-block for her observatory, could there by moonlight master the lesson of astronomy, which the merry song-singers in the house would leave her no opportunity there to learn, has already some elements of character which are the best pledges of success.</p></div3> 
<div3 id="c.14.4" type="section" n="c.14.4"> 
<head>Her experimental career.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>She has now just passed her <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> birthday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>Through the friendly solicitation of a neighbor, an intelligent lady, who, though more than twice her age, had found in her an equal, she was installed as teacher of <num value="1">one</num> of the village schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>Her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's experience here settled many a principle for her future course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>The tact with which she began would well have crowned the end of another teacher's professional career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>With her, a difficulty once encountered was mastered forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>Discarding the rod as a means of discipline, after the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day's trial, she sought and found her way so directly to the hearts of her pupils; she so skillfully planned their exercises and their sports; she so soon and so thoroughly excited their interest in their school duties, and so made this interest itself the only needed discipline, that her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school soon reported itself in all the neighborhood as a marvel of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>She found herself, even thus early in her mere girlhood, crowned with the laurels of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>And now, for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, in learning and teaching, a part of which time was spent in the excellent schools of <persName n="Royce,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00276.00968" reg="mostcommon:Royce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Royce</surname></persName> and the <rs>Misses Patten</rs>, in <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, she was fast preparing herself for entering upon the great work of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>And what was of especial value to her was the habit, then established, of prosecuting her own advanced studies while engaged in teaching those already mastered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>Such success soon attracted attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>The spring of <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct> brings to her calls from <num value="3">three</num> important schools, in <placeName reg="Westfield, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2762864">Westfield, Massachusetts</placeName>; <placeName reg="Middlebury, Addison, Vermont" key="tgn,7014046">Middlebury, Vermont</placeName>; and <persName n="Hudson,,,,," id="n0202.0014.00276.00969" reg="mostcommon:Hudson,nomatch:0"><surname>Hudson</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>She accepted the <rs>Westfield</rs> call; and as assistant teacher in the excellent academy of that town, she at once won for herself a good name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>But <persName n="Hart,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0014.00277.00970" reg="mostcommon:Hart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Hart</surname></persName> was not the person to fill long a subordinate place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>Before her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> season was over, she had decided to accept the call from <orgName type="college" n="Middlebury college">Middlebury</orgName>; and midsummer of the same year finds her at the head of her <orgName n="New School" type="school">new school</orgName> there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>A year of <quote>brilliant success</quote> crowns this <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> experiment, and settles the question of her fitness for the work she had chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>Local jealousies soon spring up, and the school, in spite of her great popularity, suffers; yet even this opposition had its influence in training and disciplining her for a better and stronger work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>While in this struggle, a new call is made upon her. <persName n="Willard,Doctor,John,,," id="n0202.0014.00277.00971" reg="default:Willard,John,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="college" n="Middlebury college">Middlebury</orgName>, a physician of good repute, and a man of solid political merit, had discovered the gifts and graces of the young teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>Nor was he long in winning his way to her heart and hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>They were happily married in <dateStruct value="1809-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>, when, for a few years, her work of teaching was interrupted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>Pecuniary reverses soon came upon them; and to aid in retrieving their fortune, <persName n="Willard,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00277.00972" reg="nearbymention:Willard,John,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, proposed to return to her chosen profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>She opened in <placeName key="tgn,7014046" n="1.000 9" reg="middlebury, addison, vermont">Middlebury</placeName> boarding-school for girls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>But she was also preparing for something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>She had, even then, detected how low and unworthy were the aims and results of that class of schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/>She was especially struck with the difference between the collegiate course of a young man, and the highest culture which the best schools of the day furnished for young women; and the discovery had been to her a summons to a new work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>With what enthusiasm she entered upon that work!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>Carefully reviewing the whole subject of woman's education, she drew up her plan for an enlarged course of study, corresponding, <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> as nearly as the different sexes would indicate, with the collegiate course for young men. But she found herself in advance of the age. The leaders in public opinion were not yet ready for such a change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/>She fortunately finds her husband in full sympathy with her, and so takes heart again, as she goes on testing its feasibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/>Working daily, <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="12">twelve</num>, or even <measure n="15hours" type="date">fifteen hours</measure> in her school duties, she still takes time to master new studies herself that she may in due time carry her pupils through them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>And so, by exploring new fields of science and literature herself; by teaching and drilling her classes, as few classes of young ladies had ever before been drilled; by adding to the old course new studies, and submitting the proficiency of her pupils to the criticism of the most learned men of the day; and by skillfully winning over to her new ideas a few leading minds, she was preparing the way for a new era in woman's education.; making possible the establishment and support of the great collegiate institutions in which women may take rank in all literature with their most scholarly brothers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>Some <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> were spent in this preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>Meanwhile the unwonted stimulus thus furnished to her own boarding-school had worked greatly in her favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>The fame of her experiment had gone far and wide; and she was now prepared to take the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps towards a permanent institution in which her enlarged views and hopes could be more fully realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>The very location of the institution was a matter of careful thought; and for it, the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, and of that State, the neighborhood of the head-waters of the <rs>Hudson</rs>, was chosen.</p></div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>The very plan, which in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct> had begun to shape itself to her eager search, sketched and resketched even to the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> time, was thus, in <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, submitted to the judgment of those who make and sustain the institutions of their age. Of the details of that plan we have not space to treat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>It is due, however, to say, that down to this day, nothing has been contributed to our educational literature which exceeds either the wisdom of its details or the eloquence of its plea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>The governor heartily approved the measures which it recommended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>The legislature so far endorsed them as to incorporate an academy at <placeName reg="Waterford, Saratoga, New York" key="tgn,2072977">Waterford, New York</placeName>, in which the founder might still more clearly show their feasibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>A still more important end secured by this movement was an acknowledgment, on the part of the legislature, that the academics in the <rs>State</rs>, designed for the education of women, were entitled to the same pecuniary aid as institutions of learning for the other sex; and a vote was accordingly passed appropriating their proportion of the literature fund to academies for girls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>We cannot but feel that it was most fortunate for <persName n="Willard,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00279.00974" reg="nearbymention:Willard,John,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName> that such a man as <persName n="Clinton,Governor,,,," id="n0202.0014.00279.00975" reg="mostcommon:Clinton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Clinton</surname></persName> was ready to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> her aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>In the forests of <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Ohio</placeName> a site had been found for the attempt, and the earnest and large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>In this post <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> she has remained until now. Her office, calling as it does for large executive and administrative ability, has been most worthily and acceptably filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>The trustees of the college are unanimous in their admiration of her signal success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>They cheerfully accept her counsel, in all matters relating to her department, as law; and they never find her counsels or her plans to fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>Under her judicious management, and, owing to this perhaps as much as to any <num value="1">one</num> agency, the college at <placeName key="tgn,7014255" n="1.000 28" reg="oberlin, lorain, ohio">Oberlin</placeName> has practically shown the safety and wisdom of educating, even through the college course, the <num value="2">two</num> sexes together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>There have been in the work some of the ablest men our country has produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Certainly, no more earnest workers have anywhere used to the utmost all their resources to sustain and build up any institution of the age. The enterprise, itself, was hopeless to any but a strong faith and resolute heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>And they who took the work in hand worked on together with good heart and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>Nor could the instituion have been established and sustained without such agency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>With it, <placeName key="tgn,7014255" n="1.000 28" reg="oberlin, lorain, ohio">Oberlin</placeName> has attained a good rank among the literary institutions of the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>But for the successful attainment of its special aim, that of the co-education of the <num value="2">two</num> sexes, even through the entire college course, another style of educational agency was needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>If young women were to be admitted and carried through the course, the presence of woman would be indispensable <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> in the faculty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>Her intelligence and tact, her sympathy and taste, and her quick sense of social proprieties would all be a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Her control and authority would reach and regulate, as man's could not, these new college relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>Especially also, was the aid of woman needed, to secure another leading idea of the <name>Oberlin</name> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>The founders wished to organize a community, as well as establish a college,--a community in thorough sympathy with their own <name>Christian</name> work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>The town itself was to be the home for their college, and its families were to feel themselves, in some sort, identified with the aims and interests of the college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>It must be a community in which young men and women could be Christianly educated, and from whose nurture they should be thoroughly prepared to go forth to their own earnestly aggressive <name>Christian</name> work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>But to aid in organizing such a community, the presence and culture and grace of <name>Christian</name> women would be requisite.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>Most fortunate, was it, then, that, when such a movement was projected, this needed agency was not wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>To make no mention of other gifted <name>Christian</name> women, who were counted worthy to engage in such a work,--though such names as those of <persName n="Shipherd,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00293.01018" reg="mostcommon:Shipherd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Shipherd</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Mahan,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00293.01019" reg="mostcommon:Mahan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs."></roleName><surname>Mahan</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Finney,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00293.01020" reg="mostcommon:Finney,Charles,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs."></roleName><surname>Finney</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Cowles,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00293.01021" reg="mostcommon:Cowles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs."></roleName><surname>Cowles</surname></persName>, may well claim no small share in this noble enterprise,--it was peculiarly providential that such a woman as <persName n="Dascomb,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00293.01022" reg="nearbymention:Dascomb,James,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dascomb</surname></persName> was then ready, both in literary attainment, and in every most needed social quality, to give herself to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>And it is not saying too much that she was ready also for the consecration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>Without reservation she entered the service, which, with no abatement of zeal, she has pursued and honored until now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>Nor is it claiming too much to say that her reward has been great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>Of about <num value="500">five hundred</num> young ladies who are annually under her instruction or influence, very few can be <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> found ho do not regard her with a feeling akin to filial affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>Of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> who have gone out from <placeName key="tgn,7014255" n="1.000 28" reg="oberlin, lorain, ohio">Oberlin</placeName>, of both sexes, we have but <num value="1">one</num> uniform testimony to the high esteem with which they regard her. Her associates in the work tell us the same story of their dependence upon her, and their great indebtedness to her influence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>Nor is it difficult to detect the secret of her power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>It lies both in her temperament and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>She is lifeful and cheerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>She shows good sense and judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>She abounds in hopefulness, which gives her confidence and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>She has no misgivings lest duty should prove inexpedient; and so her faith in the results of duty never fails her. She is self-sacrificing,--doing cheerfully for others, what she would gladly be excused from doing on her own account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>She is conscientious, anxious only to do the right thing herself, and solicitous only to aid others in seeing what is right, and doing it. <num value="1">One</num> of the most sensitively gentle of women, she has still the firmest strength of will, holding herself and holding others, as by inevitable law, to truth and duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>She could not compromise principle, though a world were to be won. With her the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question and the last is, not, Will it pay?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>not, Is it fashionable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>not, Will it please the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>but, Is it right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>She has the courage to face sneers and danger even, if in the path of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>In the day when to befriend a fugitive negro was to arouse a storm of popular rage and vengeance, she never hesitated to recognize the fugitive's claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>She acknowledged no misnamed patriotism, which required her to prove faithless to the plain call of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>Higher than all human enactments, she held and holds the claims and the law of the only <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>And so, by her gentle and patient kindness; by her fervent zeal in duty; by her disinterested love and service for others; by her uncompromising devotion to what is true and right,--she has made for herself a place of power in the community <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> where she has lived, and especially in the hearts and minds she has aided in educating for the service of the church and world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>And still, as for so many years, she is prosecuting the same good work, with the same success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>Without denying the claims of her own family and home,--in which she has reared to womanhood the <num value="2">two</num> adopted, the only children given to her to rear,--she is still laboriously employed in the duties of her great charge at the college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>In her daily work of personal interview and consultation with pupils and teachers, and the matrons of the homes in which the pupils reside; in assigning daily exercises and studies; in familiar lectures to the young ladies on all topics, outside of the general course of instruction in the classes, on which they need instruction and advice,--<persName n="Dascomb,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0014.00295.01023" reg="nearbymention:Dascomb,James,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dascomb</surname></persName> is still adding to the reputation she has already won, as a woman of eminent ability and service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>But, pre-eminently, her best record is yet to be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>It must be traced in the career of the many gifted young women whom she has aided in fitting for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>good and great, like her own. Their success, when its causes are fully known, will add new lustre to the crown, which she now so unconsciously wears. </p></div2></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>In the preface, the author declares her great purpose to be the same as that of her previous story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>Once more she endeavors to do something towards revealing to the people the true character of the system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3506"/>The book inevitably comes into comparison with its predecessor; and whatever may be truly said in its praise, it cannot be questioned that, both as a work of art and as an effective revelation of slavery, it falls far below <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3507"/>The chief defects of the book, and those which hindered the completest fulfilment of its noble purpose, are its lack of unity, and ever and anon a departure from the simplicity of a narrative or representation, into the disenchantments of discussion and argument, by which the reader is disturbed in his pleasant dream and vision, and the reality of the scenes that move before him is explained away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3508"/>The panorama does not move on without an interruption and in silence, as in the case of <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>,</quote> interpreting itself, and silently but powerfully unfolding its purpose or moral, but stops now and then to give place to the voice of the delineator in explanations or vindications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>In writing <quote><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>,</quote> the author seems never to have thought that her representations would be called in question, and accordingly she did not so much as think of fortifying herself as she advanced, or of throwing in justifications and arguments, or of going aside for facts to substantiate her narrative, but kept faithfully to the simplicity of her purpose to exhibit slavery as she had seen and known it. But, in <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> writing <quote>Dred,</quote> she seems to have labored under the embarrassment of feeling that her exhibitions needed to be explained, or justified and substantiated here and there; and as often as the artist ceased painting, and began declaiming or defining; or, in other words, by as much as <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0015.00322.01165" reg="nearbymention:Stowe,C.,E.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName> attempted to give us, with <quote>Dred,</quote> a <quote>Key</quote> to it also, she violated the most fundamental artistic conditions of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>He certainly should have <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> chosen some elderly, thin, angular, solemn, uncomfortable Calvinistic spinster, and so manifested his willingness to be damned for the glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of her residence at <placeName reg="Windsor, Berkshire, England" key="tgn,7011919">Windsor</placeName>, her mother died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/>The governess went, and had several weeks of sweet, mournful communion with her dying mother; then, when she had seen that dear form laid to sleep under the daisies in the kirk-yard, she returned to the palace, where the loneliness of royal grandeur would have oppressed her sorrowing heart beyond endurance, had it not been for the gracious, womanly sympathy of the queen, who came, every day, to her school-room,--and the considerate kindness of her young pupils.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4825"/>A year went by; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> anniversary of her great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4828"/>Every morning, before breakfast,--which the elder children took with their father and mother, in the pleasant crimson parlor looking out on the terrace at <placeName reg="Windsor, Berkshire, England" key="tgn,7011919">Windsor</placeName>,--her pupils came to the school-room, for a brief religious exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5404"/>She says she always felt herself an Ishmaelite among children, fighting not only her own battles, but for those too timid and shrinking to fight for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5405"/>Her school-days were days of darkness and trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5406"/>Owing to her mother's limited means, she was educated in the free schools of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5407"/>Meeting there the children of wealthy <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>, they would laugh at her poverty, and thoughtlessly ask her <quote>why she wore such common clothes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5408"/>She would promptly reply, <quote>My mother is poor, and we work for all we have.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5409"/>Although she accepted her condition with bravery, she determined to better it as fast as she could; yet such taunts were alike galling to her and cruel in those who uttered them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5410"/>Nevertheless, they were not without their power in developing the future woman; so far from depressing her youthful energies, they stung her into a nobler life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5411"/>In her hours of solitude she would resolve to lift herself above their shafts, to make a home for her mother, and surround her with every comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5412"/>Thus great souls feed and grow on what humbles smaller ones to dust.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5413"/>Her love for her mother was the strongest feeling in her nature, and it was to relieve her from constant toil that she early desired some profitable employment that she might earn money for her own support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5414"/>It was the sorrow of her childhood to see her mother pale and worn, struggling with all her multiplied cares,--for, in addition to her own family, she kept boarders and taught a private school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5415"/>Thus, with ceaseless love and care and industry, that noble woman fed and clothed and educated her fatherless children, and to-day has the satisfaction of seeing them all noble men and women; and mid peace and plenty she remembers the long days of darkness, poverty, and self-denial no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5416"/>For the encouragement <pb id="p.482" n="482"/> of those parents who have wayward, wilful children, I would mention the fact that <persName><foreName>Anna</foreName></persName>, who was a greater trial to her mother than all her other children and cares put together, is now her pride, her comfort, and her support.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>During all her school-days, she read with the greatest avidity every book that she could obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>Newspapers, speeches, tracts, history, biography, poetry, novels, and fairy tales were all alike read and relished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5420"/>For weeks and months together her average hours for sleep were not <num value="5">five</num> in the <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5421"/>She would often read until <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> in the morning, and then seize her school-books and learn her lessons for the next day. She did not study her lessons, for, with her retentive memory, what she read once was hers forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5422"/>The rhymes and compositions she wrote in her young days bear evident marks of genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5423"/>When <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> old she published an article headed <quote>Slavery</quote> in the <quote>Liberator.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5424"/>She early determined that she would be a public speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/><num value="1">One</num> of her greatest pleasures was to get a troop of children about her and tell them stories; if she could fix their attention and alternately convulse them with laughter, and melt them to tears, she was perfectly happy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/>She was skilful in all kinds of housework, and orderly in <pb id="p.483" n="483"/> her arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>She was willing to do any kind of work to make an honest living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5431"/>No service however hard, or humble, seemed menial to her. Being a born queen, she felt she dignified whatever she touched; even the broom became a sceptre of royalty in her hand.</p>

How she could get money to buy books was the <num value="1">one</num> thought; next to helping her mother, that occupied her mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5434"/>To this end she would do anything,--run errands, carry bundles, sweep walks,--and as soon as she had obtained the desired sum, she would buy a book, read it with the greatest avidity, then take it to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand book-store and sell it for a fraction of its cost and get another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>There was something in the style, spirit, and rhythm, that she enjoyed, even before the thought was fully understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>There are many very interesting anecdotes of her life during this period, illustrating her fortitude under most trying circumstances and her strong faith in a promising future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5439"/>Through her magnetism and self-confidence she went forward and did many things gracefully and unchallenged, that others of her sex and age would not have had the courage or presumption to attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5440"/>There was something so irresistible in her face and manner that entire <pb id="p.484" n="484"/> strangers would yield her privileges, which others would not dare to ask. In her <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> year while with relatives in the country, during the holidays, she attended a Methodist protracted meeting, and was deeply moved on the subject of religion, was converted and joined the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>Her mind, however, was much disturbed on theological questions for several years, but after great distress and uncertainty, with the opposing doctrines and opinions she heard on all sides, she found rest at last in the liberal views of those who taught that religion was life,--faith in the goodness, and wisdom of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> laws, and love to man. She disliked the silent <placeName reg="Quaker, Washington, Missouri" key="tgn,2602770">Quaker</placeName> meetings, and made every excuse to avoid them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>Her repudiation of that faith was a source of unhappiness both to her family and herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>There was something in his manner and tone so insulting that her pride compelled her to scorn the place she needed, and, drawing herself up to her full proportions, she said with great vehemence, <quote>Sir, are you a fool, or do you take me for <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>Though I am too poor to-day to buy a pair of cotton gloves, I would rather go in rags, than degrade my womanhood by accepting anything at your hands.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>And she shook the dust of that place from her feet, and went home to struggle on with poverty, firm in the faith of future success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>Young, inexperienced, penniless, with but few friends, and none knowing her greatest trials, she passed weeks looking for a situation, in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>At last she was offered a place as saleswoman in a store, which she accepted; <pb id="p.485" n="485"/> but finding that it was her duty to misrepresent goods to customers, she left at once, because she would not violate her conscience with the tricks of trade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>The distinctions she saw everywhere between boys and girls, men and women, giving all the opportunities and advantages of life to <num value="1">one</num> sex, early filled her with indignation, and she determined to resist this tyranny wherever she found it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>The next <rs>Sunday</rs> she spoke again, and on the same subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>An attempt was made, by an opponent, by interruptions, foolish questions, sneers, and ridicule to put her down.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/>This was a tall, nervous, bilious man, who spoke with the arrogance and assumption usual in that type of manhood,as if he were a partner of the <rs>Most High</rs> in giving law to the universe; as if it were his special mission to map out the sphere of woman, the paths wherein she might with safety <pb id="p.486" n="486"/> walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5463"/>By some magnetic law he fixed his eyes on this strange girl, into whose soul the floods of indignation were pouring thick and fast; and when he finished, the scene that followed was almost tragic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>She rose, her feelings at white heat, and, with flashing eye and crimson cheek, she turned upon her antagonist, looking him square in the face, and poured out the vials of her pent &mdash; up wrath,--the sum of all the wrongs she had felt through struggling girlhood; the insults to womanhood she had read and heard; the barbarisms of law, of custom, and of daily life, that but for the strong will <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had given her to resist, would have ground her, with the multitudes of her sex, to powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>She poured out such volleys of invective, sarcasm, and denunciation, painted the helplessness of women with such pathos and power, giving touching incidents of her own hard experience, that her antagonist sunk lower and lower into his seat and bowed his head in silence and humiliation, while those who witnessed the scene were melted to tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>Never was an audience more electrified and amazed than were they with the eloquence and power of that young girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>Her public career was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a great mortification to her mother, who felt that by this erratic course she was bringing shame and humiliation on her family, never dreaming that she was so soon to occupy <num value="1">one</num> of the proudest positions before the <rs>American</rs> people, to distinguish her family, and place them in conditions of ease and luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5520"/>After the listless, monotonous harangues of the previous part of the day, the distinct, earnest tones of this juvenile <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName> of Are were very sweet and charming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5522"/>Those who did not sympathize with her remarks were softened by her simplicity and solemnity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5523"/>Her speech was decidedly the feature of the evening, provocative as it was of numerous, unmanly interruptions, and followed by discussion of prolonged and diversified interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5527"/>Eminent lawgivers have said that certain great fundamental ideas of right were common to the world, and that all laws of man's making which trampled upon those ideas were null and void,--wrong to obey, but right to disobey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5534"/>She felt that she was not equal to the occasion; instead of being flattered with the praises bestowed upon her, she was filled with regret that she had not made a more careful and thoughtful preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5535"/>But she learned an important lesson from what she considered a failure, worth more than it cost her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5536"/>Spring was opening, and her fresh young spirit and strong will demanded some new avenues to labor, some active, profitable work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5537"/>In her searches for something to do, says a friend, <quote>I met her <num value="1">one</num> day in the street; said she, <q direct="unspecified">I must work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5542"/>She sat on a stool all those long hours, in a close, impure atmosphere, the windows and doors being always closed in the adjusting room, as the least draft of air would vary the scales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5543"/>She soon became very skilful in her new business, and did twice the amount of work of most other girls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5544"/>She was the fastest adjuster in the <name>Mint</name>; but she could not endure the confinement, and soon changed to the coining-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5545"/>But this dull routine of labor did not satisfy her higher nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5546"/>After the day's work was done, she would go to the hospitals to write letters for the sick soldiers, to read to them, and talk over the incidents of the war. Many things conspired to make her situation in the <name>Mint</name> undesirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5547"/>The character and conversation of the inmates were disagreeable to her; hence she kept them at a distance, while, her opinions on slavery and woman's rights being known, she was treated with reserve and suspicion in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5548"/>In <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> she made a speech in <placeName key="tgn,7014612" n="1.000 7" reg="westchester, new york, united states">Westchester</placeName> on the events of the war, which increased this state of feeling towards her, and culminated in her discharge from the <name>Mint</name>, in the <name>Christmas</name> holidays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5558"/>She says that was the best service the <rs>Governor</rs> could have rendered her, as it forced her to the decision to labor no longer with her hands for bread, but to open some new path for herself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5559"/>She continued speaking, during the winter, in many of the neighboring towns, on the political aspects of the war. As the popular thought was centring everywhere on national questions, she began to think less of the special wrongs of women and negroes, and more of the causes of revolutions, and the true basis of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5560"/>These broader views secured her popularity, and made her available in party politics at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5561"/>In the mean time <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0020.00493.02021" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, having heard <persName n="Dickinson,,Anna,,," id="n0202.0020.00493.02022" reg="default:Dickinson,Anna,,,"><foreName>Anna</foreName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> speak at <placeName key="tgn,7014612" n="1.000 7" reg="westchester, new york, united states">Westchester</placeName> and <placeName reg="Longwood, Chester, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090274">Longwood</placeName>, and being both charmed and surprised with her oratorical power, invited her to visit <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and make his house her home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5562"/>Before going to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> some friends desired that she should make the same speech in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> that had occasioned her dismissal from the <name>Mint</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5563"/>Accordingly, <placeName reg="Concert Hall">Concert Hall</placeName> was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5565"/>She had a full house, at <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> admission, was received with great enthusiasm, and acquitted herself to her own satisfaction, as well as that of her friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5566"/>After all expenses were paid she found herself the happy possessor of a larger sum of money than she had ever had before; and now, in consultation with <pb id="p.494" n="494"/> good <persName n="Longshore,Doctor,Hannah,,," id="n0202.0020.00494.02024" reg="default:Longshore,Hannah,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Hannah</foreName> <surname>Longshore</surname></persName>, it was decided that she should have her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> silk dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5567"/>With this friend's advice and blessing, she went to <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> to endure fresh trials and disappointments before securing that unquestioned reputation and pecuniary independence she enjoys to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5568"/>Through the influence and friendship of <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0020.00494.02025" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> she was invited to speak in <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0202.0020.00494.02026" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s pulpit on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, as leading reformers were then doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5569"/>Accordingly she spoke, in <placeName reg="Music Hall">Music Hall</placeName>, on the <quote>National crisis.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5570"/>Her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lecture in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> was the greatest trial she ever experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5571"/>Her veneration for the character of a Boston audience almost over-matched her courage and confidence in her ability to sustain herself through such an ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5572"/>Her friends also had misgivings, and feared a failure, as they noticed that <persName n="Anna,,,,," id="n0202.0020.00494.02027" reg="mostcommon:Anna,nomatch:0"><surname>Anna</surname></persName> could neither sleep nor eat for <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> previous to the lecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5573"/>Some were so confident that she would fail to meet the expectations of the immense audience, that they refused to sit on the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5574"/><persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0020.00494.02028" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> opened the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/>He read a chapter of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and consumed some time in remarks in order to make the best of the dilemma, which, in common with many, he, too, apprehended, while <persName n="Anna,,,,," id="n0202.0020.00494.02029" reg="mostcommon:Anna,nomatch:0"><surname>Anna</surname></persName> waited behind him to be <quote>presented,</quote> in an agony of suspense she struggled to conceal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>At last she was introduced, and began in some broken, hesitating sentences; but, gradually becoming absorbed in her subject, she forgot herself and her new surroundings, and so completely held the attention and interest of the audience for over an hour that the fears of her friends were turned to rejoicings, the anticipations of the few were more than realized, and her own long anxious hours of prayers and tears were forgotten in the proud triumph of that day. At the close she was overpowered with thanks, praises, and salutations of love and gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>As she delivered this lecture in several of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> cities I give the following notice:--<pb id="p.495" n="495"/> 
<text><body> 
<head>The new star.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5578"/>If to have an audience remain quiet, attentive, and sympathizing during the delivery of a long lecture, is any indication of the ability, tact, and success of the speaker, we think it may be claimed for <persName n="Dickinson,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0020.00495.02030" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Anna,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> that she is a compeer worthy to be admitted as a particular star in the large and brilliant constellation of genius and talent now endeavoring to direct the country to the goal of negro emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5579"/><placeName reg="Music Hall">Music Hall</placeName> was filled to overflowing; hundreds of the audience went early, and must have sat there more than an hour before the lecture began; and, yet, we do not remember to have seen less signs of weariness and inattention at any lecture we ever attended in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>Her voice is clear and penetrating, without being harsh; her enunciation is very distinct, and at times somewhat rhythmic in its character, with enough of a peculiar accent to indicate that her home has not been in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5581"/>Her whole appearance and manner are decidedly attractive, earnest, and expressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5582"/>Her lecture was well-arranged, logical, and occasionally eloquent, persuasive, and pathetic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5583"/>She traced the demands and usurpations of the <rs>Slave Power</rs> from the commencement of our government till the present time, and proved that, because it could not hope to control the country in the future as it had in the past, it raised the standard of rebellion,--an act long since determined upon when such an exigency should arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5584"/>Slavery being thus proved to be the cause of the war, the justice, necessity, and propriety of its abolition, as a means of present defence and future security and peace, was forcibly illustrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5585"/>That the slave was prepared for freedom was proved by the <num value="1000">thousands</num> who have passed through so much danger and suffering to obtain it. The inhuman character of the fugitive slave enactment was most beautifully referred to, bringing tears to many eyes which are not accustomed to weep over the wrongs of the colored race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5586"/>She spoke in eloquent terms of <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0202.0020.00495.02031" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>, which met with a hearty response from the audience, as did other parts of her address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5587"/>On the whole, we think her friends here must be greatly delighted with her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort, on her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to our old Commonwealth.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5590"/>She spent the following summer in reading and study, collecting materials for other lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5591"/>She continued, as she had time, to visit the government hospitals, and made herself a most welcome guest among our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5592"/>In her long conversations with them, she learned their individual histories, experiences, hardships, and sufferings; the motives that prompted them to go into the army; what they saw there, and what they thought of war in their hours of solitude, away from the excitement of the camp and the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5593"/>Thus <pb id="p.496" n="496"/> she got an insight into the soldier's life and feelings, and from these narratives drew her materials for that deeply interesting lecture on Hospital Life, which she delivered in many parts of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5594"/>In <dateStruct value="1862-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, she spoke before the <rs>Boston Fraternity Lyceum</rs>, for which she received many flattering notices and <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure>. She had hoped, through the influence of friends, to make a series of appointments for the winter, and thus secure a means of support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5595"/>But the military reverses and discouragements left but little spirit among the people for lectures of any kind, and she travelled from place to place until her funds were exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5596"/>Her lecture at <placeName reg="Concord, Merrimack, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013647">Concord, New Hampshire</placeName>, was her last engagement for, the season, and the <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> promised there was all she had in prospect for future need until something else might offer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5597"/>This was a trying experience, for she had just begun to hope that her days of darkness had passed and triumph was near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5598"/>In speaking of it she says, <quote>No <num value="1">one</num> knows how I felt and suffered that winter, penniless and alone, with a scanty wardrobe, suffering with cold, weariness, and disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5599"/>I wandered about on the trains day after day, among strangers, seeking employment for an honest living, and failed to find it. I would have gone home, but had not the means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5600"/>I had borrowed money to commence my journey, promising to remit soon; failing to do so, I could not ask again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5601"/>Beyond my <placeName reg="Concord, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1123016">Concord</placeName> meeting all was darkness; I had no further plans.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5602"/>But her lecture there on Hospital Life was the turning-point in her fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5603"/>In this speech she proved slavery to be the cause of the war, and that its continuance would result in prolonged suffering to our soldiers, defeat to our armies, and the downfall of the republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5604"/>She related many touching incidents of her experiences in hospital life, and drew such vivid pictures of the horrors of both war and slavery, that, by her pathos and logic, she melted her audience to tears, <pb id="p.497" n="497"/> and forced the most prejudiced minds to accept her conclusions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5605"/>It was on this occasion that the secretary of the <orgName n="State Central Committee" type="committee">State Central Committee</orgName> heard her for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5607"/>Fully appreciating her magnetic power over an audience, he resolved at once, that, if the <rs>State Committee</rs> refused to invite her, he should do so on his own responsibility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5608"/>But, through his influence, she was invited by the <orgName n="Republican committee" type="committee">Republican committee</orgName>, and on the <dateStruct value="-03-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> commenced her regular campaign speeches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5609"/>In the <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure> before election, she spoke <num value="20">twenty</num> times,--everywhere to crowded, enthusiastic audiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5610"/>Her march through the <rs>State</rs> was a succession of triumphs, and ended in a Republican victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5611"/>The member in the <orgName type="district" n="district 1">first district</orgName>, having no faith that a woman could influence politics, sent word to the secretary, <quote>Don't send that d-- woman down here to defeat my election.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5612"/>The secretary replied, <quote>We have work enough for her to do in other districts, without interfering with you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5616"/>It is pleasant to record that this man, who had the moral hardihood to use a profane adjective in speaking of a woman, lost his election; and thus our congressional halls were saved from so demoralizing an influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/>It was generally conceded that, if <persName n="Seymour,,,,," id="n0202.0020.00498.02036" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,Orson,,,:1"><surname>Seymour</surname></persName> was elected, <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> would give no more money or troops for the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5625"/>Though the issue was <num value="1">one</num> of such vital importance, there seemed so little hope of success, that the <name>Republicans</name> were disposed to give it up without making an effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5630"/>There never was such a furor about an orator in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5631"/>The period of her advent, the excited condition of the people, her youth, beauty, and remarkable voice, all heightened the effect of her genius, and helped to produce this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5632"/>Her name was on every lip. Ministers preached about her, prayed for her as a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Joan of Arc, raised up by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to save that State to the loyal party, and through it the nation to freedom and <pb id="p.499" n="499"/> humanity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>Some leading men in <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> presented her a gold watch and chain as a memento for her valuable services in the <rs>State</rs>, paid her a <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure> for every night she had spoken there, and for the last night before election, in <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5636"/> The highest compliment that the <rs>Union</rs> men of this city could pay <persName n="Dickinson,Miss,Anna,B.,," id="n0202.0020.00499.02040" reg="default:Dickinson,Anna,B.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Anna</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> was to invite her to make the closing and most important speech in this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5637"/>They were willing to rest their case upon her efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5638"/>She may go far and speak much; she will have no more flattering proof of the popular confidence in her eloquence, tact, power, than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/>Her business being to obtain votes for the right side, she addressed herself to that end with singular adaptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>But when we add to this lawyer-like comprehension of the necessities of the case, her earnestness, enthusiasm, and personal magnetism, we account for the effect she produced on the vast audience <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/><placeName reg="Allyn Hall">Allyn Hall</placeName> was packed as it never was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>Every seat was crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>The aisles were full of men who stood patiently for more than <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, the window-sills had their occupants, every foot of standing-room was taken, and in the rear of the galleries men seemed to hang in swarms like bees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5644"/>Such was the view from the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/>The stage itself and the boxes were filled with ladies, giving the speaker an audience of at least <num value="200">two hundred</num> who could not see her face.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5646"/>To such an audience <persName n="Dickinson,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0020.00499.02041" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Anna,B.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> spoke for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> and <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, and hardly a listener left the hall during that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5647"/>Her power over the audience was marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5648"/>She seemed to have that absolute mastery of it which <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName> of Arc is reported to have had of the <rs>French</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>They followed her with that deep attention which is unwilling to lose a word, but greeted her, every few moments, with the most wild applause, which continued often for several minutes, breaking forth afresh with irrepressible enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>We find no occasion to abate a word from the very high estimate given of <pb id="p.500" n="500"/> her as an orator from her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5651"/>And she added vastly, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, to the estimate of her by her versatility and ability as an advocate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5652"/>The speech, in itself, and its effect was magnificent,--this strong adjective is the proper <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5653"/>If the campaign were not closed, we should give a full sketch of the speech, for its pertinent effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5654"/>But the work of the campaign is done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5655"/>And it only remains, in the name, we are sure, of all loyal men in this district, to express to <persName n="Dickinson,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0020.00500.02042" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Anna,B.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> most heartfelt thanks for her splendid, inspiring aid. She has aroused everywhere respect, enthusiasm, and devotion, let us not say to herself alone, but to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5656"/>While such women are possible in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, there isn't a spot big enough for her to stand on, that won't be fought for so long as there is a man left.</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5657"/>Fresh from the victories in <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName> and <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, she was announced to speak in <orgName n="Cooper Institute" type="institute">Cooper Institute</orgName>, New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5658"/>That meeting in <dateStruct value="1862-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, was the most splendid ovation to a woman's genius since <persName n="Kemble,,Fanny,,," id="n0202.0020.00500.02043" reg="default:Kemble,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Kemble</surname></persName>, in all the wealth of her youth and beauty, appeared on the <rs>American</rs> stage for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/>On no <num value="2">two</num> occasions of my life have I been so deeply moved, so exalted, so lost in overflowing gratitude, that woman had revealed her power in oratory,that highest art to touch the deepest feelings of the human soul,--and verified at last her right to fame and immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>There never was such excitement over any meeting in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>Although the hall was densely crowded long before the hour announced, yet the people outside were determined to get in at all hazards,--ushers were beaten down, those without tickets rushed in, and those with tickets were pushed aside, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> went home unable to get standing-places even in the lobbies and outer halls.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5662"/>The platform was graced with the most distinguished men and women in the country, and so crowded that the young orator had scarce room to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5663"/>There were clergymen, generals, <rs type="role" n="Admiral">admirals</rs>, judges, lawyers, editors, the literati and leaders of fashion, and all alike ready to do homage to this simple girl, who moved them alternately to laughter and tears, to bursts of applause and the most profound silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5664"/><persName n="Beecher,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0020.00500.02044" reg="mostcommon:Beecher,Harriet,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>, who was president of the meeting, introduced the speaker in his happiest manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5665"/>For more than an hour she <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> held that large audience with deep interest and enthusiasm, and, when she finished with a beautiful peroration, the people seemed to take a long breath, as if to find relief from the intensity of their emotions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5666"/>Loud cries followed for <persName n="Beecher,Mister,,,," id="n0202.0020.00501.02045" reg="mostcommon:Beecher,Harriet,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>; but he arose, and, with great feeling and solemnity, said, <quote>Let no man open his lips here to-night; music is the only fitting accompaniment to the eloquent utterances we have heard.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5667"/>So the <name>Hutchinsons</name> closed the meeting with <num value="1">one</num> of their soul-stirring ballads, and the audience dispersed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5668"/>As none of the materials furnished for this sketch have interested me more than the comments of the press, I give the following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>Knowing that <persName n="Dickinson,,Anna,,," id="n0202.0020.00501.02046" reg="default:Dickinson,Anna,,,"><foreName>Anna</foreName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> will be as great a wonder to another generation as <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName> of Arc is to this, the testimony of our leading journals to her eloquence and power furnishes an important page in future history:--

<head><persName n="Dickinson,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0020.00501.02047" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Anna,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> at the <orgName n="Cooper Institute" type="institute">Cooper Institute</orgName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>The crowd at the <orgName n="Cooper Institute" type="institute">Cooper Institute</orgName> last evening must be truly called immense, no other word being adequate to the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>The attraction was an address by <persName n="Dickinson,Miss,Anna,E.,," id="n0202.0020.00501.02048" reg="expanded:Dickinson,Anna,Elizabeth,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Anna</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, upon the subject of <quote> The Day &mdash; the <name>Cause</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>She is of the medium height, slight in form, graceful in movement; her head, well-poised, is adorned with full and heavy dark hair, displaying to advantage a pleasant face, which has the signs of nervous force and of vigorous mental life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>In manner she is unembarrassed, without a shade of boldness ; her gesticulation is simple, drawing to itself no remark; her voice is of wonderful power, penetrating rather than loud, as clear as the tone of metal, and yet with a reed-like softness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>Her vocabulary is simple, and in no instance can there be seen a straining after effective expressions; yet her skill in using the ordinary stores of our daily language is so great, that with a single phrase she presents a picture, and delivers a poem in a sentence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/> <persName n="Dickinson,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0020.00501.02049" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Anna,E.,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> shows in her oratorical method the feminine peculiarities which lead her sex to prefer results to preliminaries, the sharply defined success of conclusions to the regularly progressing course of previous argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5676"/>Her lecture was consequently very effective to the ear, and difficult to report with justice to the speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5677"/>She defined the contest with the <rs>South</rs> as the struggle between liberty and slavery in the broadest sense of the words, extending to the moral, mental, and social world, and illustrated her position with rapid allusions to the political history of the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. She then drew a variety of comparisons between the loyalty of the <num value="2">two</num> parties at the <rs>North</rs>, and, in answer to the question what sort of generals each had given to the country, made <pb id="p.502" n="502"/> some hits of great force at many well-known officers, and paid a tribute of praise to others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5678"/>It was in this part of her address that the brightness of her wit and the power of condensed expression already alluded to was seen most clearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5679"/>A single stroke of the pencil placed not only a name but a character distinctly before the audience, who took quickly, and fully enjoyed every point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5680"/>The enrolment act, the threats of the <rs>Northwest</rs> to compromise for themselves and leave <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> out in the cold, and the present splendid revival of patriotic confidence in the <rs>North</rs>,were treated with surprising power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5681"/>The applause which burst from the audience at almost every sentence was more hearty and enthusiastic than even in the excited political gatherings of an election season, and was, moreover, applause born of the deepest and best feelings of loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5682"/>At the conclusion of the lecture, which came to a close with a truly beautiful peroration, the <name>Hutchinson</name> family sang <num value="1">one</num> of their best pieces, and then, by request, followed it with the <rs>John Brown</rs> song, in the chorus of which the audience joined with a thrilling effect.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5687"/>The <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> journals vied with each other in their eulogiums of her grace, beauty,, and eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5700"/>As she stood there uttering words of warning and prophecy, it seemed as if her lips had been touched with a live coal from the altar of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/>Her inspired words moved the hearts of our young soldiers to deeds of daring, and gave fresh courage to those about to bid their loved ones go, and die, if need be, for freedom and their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>The hour, the mysterious light, the stillness, the novel surroundings, the youth of the speaker, all gave a peculiar power to her words, and made the scene <num value="1">one</num> of the most thrilling and beautiful on the page of history.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>Accordingly she accepted their proposals, and threw her whole energy and enthusiasm into that campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5990"/>Many causes have been promoted by her public advocacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5991"/>In private relations many a crushed, despairing woman has risen to new life under her stirring appeals, many a bold, profligate man has shrunk abashed before her pungent rebukes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5993"/>She is a genuine Bostonian (a title which has significance, <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> both favorable and unfavorable), pedigreed, born, bred, and habituated as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5995"/>He was of a strong stock, full of vitality physical and mental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5997"/>He was a shipping merchant, and through energy and prudence came into easy circumstances, amid which, <persName><foreName>Harriot</foreName></persName> and her <persName><roleName n="Sister">sister</roleName> <foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>, the only children, were reared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5999"/>Her home was a happy <num value="1">one</num>, and everything which affection could devise to foster her constitutional buoyancy of character was lavished upon her. Nothing occurred to shade the steady brightness of her life until <dateStruct value="1827--"><year reg="1827">1827</year></dateStruct>, when the sudden death of her father changed all her prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6000"/>His estate was found to be encumbered and the settlement difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6001"/>A few months previous, with some intimations of his embarrassed affairs, the sisters had opened a school, which became now the chief dependence of the family, beyond the small income from the property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6002"/>It was also a means of discipline to themselves, qualifying them for their future work, brought them more into contact with the domestic lives of others, and acquainted them with those private underlying facts in regard to the condition of young girls and their home management, upon which so largely depends their health in maturer years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6003"/><persName><foreName>Harriot</foreName></persName> says of it, <quote>My school was flourishing and I loved it. Yet I never felt it my true vocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6004"/>It seemed to be preparing me for something higher and more permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6005"/>It was but transitional.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6006"/>In <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> her sister was prostrated by severe illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6007"/>This, with <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> the experience of medical treatment in connection with it, formed the turning-point in the history of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6008"/>It was a distressing, complicated disease, and the prescriptions were after the severest forms of the <orgName n="Old School" type="school">old school</orgName> of practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6009"/>After <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> sickness without improvement, the sisters were roused to consider and study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6010"/>They procured medical books and read, and arrived at the conclusion that the case had been misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6011"/>Then came a change of physicians, with some advantage; but the interest awakened in the study of medicine and the conviction that much of the ordinary practice was blind and merely experimental, led them to pursue the investigation further for themselves and for the benefit of similar sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6012"/>In <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Mott,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00530.02209" reg="mostcommon:Mott,Lucretia,,,:13"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName>, an English woman, established herself in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6013"/>Her husband was a physician, but the care of female patients devolved chiefly upon her. She made extravagant claims to medical skill in the treatment of cases regarded as hopeless; yet her general success was too evident to be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6014"/>She attracted their attention, and, in spite of friendly protests and the displeasure of former attendants, the invalid was placed under her care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6015"/>The result was favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6016"/>After more than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> confinement, she was soon able to walk the streets and to attend church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6017"/>Relations of intimacy and affection were created between the physician and her patient's family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6018"/>After a time they changed their residence, leasing their own house, and taking rooms in <persName n="Mott,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00530.02210" reg="mostcommon:Mott,Lucretia,,,:13"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName>'s.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6019"/>She entered upon it with her usual ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6020"/>It enlarged the sphere of her observation, intensified her sympathy especially for those afflicted with hidden ailments, and <quote>deepened the instinct which pointed her to the medical profession.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6021"/>Meanwhile she read with avidity everything which bore upon it. She was fascinated by it, eager for knowledge in each department <pb id="p.531" n="531"/> and delighted with the results of research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6022"/>Her mind, however, biased by her experience in her sister's case, turned most readily in the direction of inquiry after the laws of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6023"/>She <quote>endeavored to trace diseases to violated laws, and learn the science of prevention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6024"/>That word, prevention, seemed a great word to me,</quote> she says; <quote>curative was small beside it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6025"/>The death of <persName n="Mott,Doctor,,,," id="n0202.0021.00531.02212" reg="mostcommon:Mott,Lucretia,,,:13"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName> caused <persName n="Mott,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00531.02213" reg="mostcommon:Mott,Lucretia,,,:13"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName> to return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and broke up the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6026"/>Still the studies were pursued, with an increasingly clear persuasion of what the purpose of her life was to be, and a very distinct recognition of providential guidance in it. The period spent thus, nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> (including her attendance in <placeName><persName n="Mott,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00531.02214" reg="mostcommon:Mott,Lucretia,,,:13"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName>'s office</placeName>), in addition to the more private reading in the sick-room during the intervals of relief from school duties, was <num value="1">one</num> of extreme application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6027"/>Few students after the regular modes, with all the facilities of tuition afforded them, have ranged over a wider field of knowledge or searched it more thoroughly, so far as it can be exhibited in books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6028"/>The opportunities for more practical examination by the bedside, or in contact otherwise with the subjects of maladies, came subsequently, and were pursued with an eagerness sharpened by the consciousness of deficiency resulting from the previous lack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6029"/>i In <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct> an office was opened, the <num value="2">two</num> names, <persName><foreName>Harriot</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Sarah</foreName></persName>, associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6030"/>They studied and practised together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6031"/>Often in the late night hours they recited to each other lessons from medical works, or compared views upon cases presented during the day. Each new case was a fresh revelation to them, or gave them a deeper insight into What they had already learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6032"/>There is a singular charm about this part of their biography, as we have obtained glimpses of it. <persName><foreName>Harriot</foreName></persName> evidently took the lead in everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6033"/>She was <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of age,--the very acme of human life,--in vigorous health, every faculty fully developed and toned to its highest point, of indomitable will and overflowing <pb id="p.532" n="532"/> with enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6034"/>With no professional support, no conferred title as guaranty of capacity or attainment, no advertising resorts for attraction, she launched from the safe harbor of domestic privacy and social protection upon an untried sea of responsibility and public scrutiny, with suitable discretion, and yet with unflinching confidence that she was on the track to which the <rs>Divine Hand</rs> had brought her. Her practice was not after any established formulas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6035"/>She was bound by the regulations of no school, as none had endorsed her. She valued the ordinary medicines, so far as she perceived their restorative effects, but received and used freely any remedial agency whether moral or physical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6036"/>She writes, <quote>I was particularly attracted to mental diseases and often found physical maladies growing out of concealed sorrows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6037"/>We were frequently surprised by the successful termination of many of our cases through prescription for mental states; and the causes of diseases, with the quality of remedies for them, became a deeper study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6038"/>Love for our calling gave life to the calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6039"/>Every fact we gathered had its use, and while the perceptive faculties were stimulated, the reflective were educated for guidance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6040"/>And again, <quote>Medication alone is not to be relied on. In <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the cases medicine is not needed and is worse than useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6041"/>Obedience to spiritual and physical laws &mdash; hygiene of the body and hygiene of the spirit &mdash; is the surest warrant for health and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6042"/>It is only the quacks of the profession, emulous of the quacks ostracized by the faculty, who put their trust in dosing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6043"/>The true physician knows better.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6044"/>Patients gathered slowly at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but with steady increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6045"/>Many were declined conscientiously, because beyond her present knowledge or ability, and without any false pride of reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6046"/>Obstetrics and other surgery she never practised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6047"/>We pass over a few years, during which she was gaining experience, position, influence, and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6048"/>Her <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> sister married and removed, and she was left alone in her professional work, which began to grow rapidly in its demands upon her. In <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct> a <quote>Ladies' Physiological Society</quote> was organized in <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, at her suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6049"/>The members met twice a month, to read and converse upon topics which the name indicates, while industriously occupied for some benevolent object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6050"/>Within the year it increased in numbers from a dozen to <num value="50">fifty</num>, and was long sustained with spirit and benefit, and, for aught we know, is still in active existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>Its formation was eventful to <persName n="Hunt,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0021.00533.02215" reg="nearbymention:Hunt,Joab,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Hunt</surname></persName>, as giving her the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hint of the possibility of lecturing to her own sex. At many of their meetings she addressed them, and acquired thus the freedom and facility of speech which she has since exercised abundantly, before larger and more general audiences, upon a variety of subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6052"/>In <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, at the suggestion of friends, as well as the prompting of an earnest wish for information through every avenue, she applied to the faculty of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> for permission to attend a course of lectures in the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName>, stating that, at the age of <num value="42">forty-two</num>, after <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> practice, which had become extensive, and ranking among her friends many of the most intelligent citizens, it would be evident to them that the request must proceed from no want of patronage, but simply from a desire for such scientific light as could be imparted by their professors, and as would make her more worthy of the trusts committed to her. The application was refused, simply upon the ground of expediency, without assigning reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6053"/><measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> afterward she repeated it, accompanying it with an able letter, hoping that the favor with which <persName n="Blackwell,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0021.00533.02216" reg="nearbymention:Blackwell,Emily,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Blackwell</surname></persName> had been received elsewhere, and the full discussion of the matter on several occasions, might induce a different decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6054"/>It proved so; and permission was granted by the proper officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6055"/>The students, however, waxed indignant at the prospect of such an associate in their <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> studies (or, perhaps, such a witness of their manners), and vehemently protested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6056"/>Unwilling to create disturbance, where her object had been entirely disinterested, she generously declined to avail herself of the long-coveted opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6057"/>The medical class of <dateStruct value="1851--"><year reg="1851">1851</year></dateStruct>, at <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName>, so unlike that of <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, at <placeName reg="Geneva, Ontario, New York" key="tgn,2069365">Geneva</placeName>, in the case of <persName n="Blackwell,Miss,,,," id="n0202.0021.00534.02217" reg="nearbymention:Blackwell,Emily,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Blackwell</surname></persName>, gained for themselves an unenviable notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6060"/>Every aspect of that movement profoundly affected her, and she gave her influence earnestly to it. Her special part in it, however, and her public speech, when opportunity offered, was concerning the sanitary reforms needed among women, and their right and duty to take care of themselves and each other and their offspring in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6061"/><quote>Woman as physician to her sex</quote> was her theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6062"/>The conventions furnished her fitting occasions for urging it. They brought her also more prominently before the public, and prepared the way for numerous meetings, called for the purpose exclusively of listening to her appeals upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6063"/>At intervals, through several summers, as convenience served, and she could be spared from professional charge at home, she made tours through <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">New York State</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, delivering addresses, organizing associations, visiting colleges and schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6064"/>That she spoke well and effectively may be inferred from the character of her audiences, composed of the most intelligent classes, and the practical results in societies formed, and new impulse given to measures for the education of women in every department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6065"/>During the last few years her life has not been marked by any events which could appropriately be noticed <pb id="p.535" n="535"/> in our sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6066"/>She has continued her residence in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and pursued her practice in a steadily increasing circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6067"/>Her example has encouraged others to enter the field; and she has now some able co-laborers in the city, whom she thankfully welcomes and assists, declaring, <quote>All women-worker; have my benediction.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6068"/>At the end of <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> she celebrated her silver wedding to her profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6069"/>Her house was crowded with cordial friends, who decorated it with flowers, and testified their esteem by abundant tokens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6070"/>Advanced in years, her spirit is still buoyant as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6071"/>She writes, <quote>Knowing that all life is from the <rs>Lord</rs>, mine, professionally, has been radiant, and I have enjoyed so much in it!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6074"/>Sorrowing much over suffering, with burning indignation against vices and oppressions, her habitual mood is yet joyful; and few who come into her presence can resist its magnetic power, or fail to go from it stirred to higher and purer endeavors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6075"/>She has cured many, enlightened, cheered, and elevated multitudes.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6097"/>In his family and elsewhere he dwelt on it with emphasis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6098"/>He maintained that every child had a right to the best possible advantages for intellectual culture, and, equally, that it was the interest and duty of society to train them in habits of intelligent industry; that every <num value="1">one</num> should contribute in some way to the common product; no sinecure posts, no drones, no consumers who should not be either directly producers, or so actively helpful to the producers that they could claim a share of the benefit, on the apostolic principle that <quote>if any would not work neither should he eat.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6099"/>His children grew up deeply imbued with this principle, and with it a feeling of individual responsibility and self-reliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/>There were <num value="6">six</num> children, <num value="1">one</num> brother and <num value="5">five</num> sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>The older sisters passed much time in the open air, in the society of their father on the farm, aiding him in the various branches of labor adapted to their capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/>During the busiest seasons in the field, however, a portion of the day was devoted to reading and to conversations between parents and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/>All the branches of natural science were more or less considered during these periods, while at labor as well as in the intervals of rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>It was beautiful and instructive to witness the family group in these discussions, and note the thoughtfulness and enthusiasm exhibited,--frequently the utmost eagerness and exhilaration of spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>In the same connection religion, morality, social reforms, politics, and whatever interested or agitated society, received such share of their attention as other duties permitted, and the mental development of each child seemed to demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>In these respects they were different from most of their acquaintances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>Independent, united, satisfied with their domestic resources for enjoyment, they became somewhat isolated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/>They were respected in the <pb id="p.539" n="539"/> neighborhood, yet feared and shunned by many as eccentric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>Summer after summer, in rural simplicity, was thus occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>When not working in the field, <persName n="Hannah,,,,," id="n0202.0021.00539.02225" reg="mostcommon:Hannah,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannah</surname></persName> was assisting a delicate, feeble mother in household duties, and caring for the younger children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>These physical toils, combined with mental activity, imparted discipline and courage to accomplish whatever task was undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>The comparative leisure of winter was more fully devoted to study, occupied as pupil or teacher in the district school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>She attended <num value="1">one</num> term at the <rs>New Lisbon Academy</rs>, about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from her home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>This distance she walked at morning and evening, regularly braving the storms, the bitter cold, and drifting snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/>Neither the long walk, nor domestic duties, nor other trifling reasons, were ever offered of needed as an excuse for imperfectly prepared lessons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>Beside the milking-pail, the churn, the wash-tub, the ironing-table, somewhere would the book be placed, that study might progress while the hands were busy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/>She joined the <orgName n="Literary Society" type="society">literary society</orgName> connected with the academy, prepared essays, and gave lectures on scientific subjects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>At a very early period an interest in anatomy was developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>When <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of age she was often occupied in the examination of insects, and the dissection of small animals, pursuing it with the same nicety and accuracy with which she would also analyze flowers, to gratify a craving for knowledge in these departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>Very soon her attention was turned to the study of medicine, with a view to practise, by the family physician, whose prescriptions it had been her part to administer in the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>Arrangements were made to commence regular reading; but untoward events frustrated the plan, and it was postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>At the age of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> she married, and the subsequent <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> were chiefly devoted to domestic duties, partly on a farm, and partly in a quiet village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>This, though apparently a blank portion of her <pb id="p.540" n="540"/> history, was not blank in useful experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>It was here that her well-developed, but comparatively unregulated forces of mind and heart, and indomitable energy, were concentrated and directed into a practical channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/>She was put upon her own resources, and her innate executive qualities were brought into requisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/>Never entirely satisfied that she was occupying her whole sphere, she nevertheless resolved that she would fill that portion of it well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/>The proficiency she acquired in the performance of every service connected with house-keeping, and the charge of a family in sickness and health, she often refers to with thankfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>Without this skill and experience she would not feel qualified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/>to meet the emergencies often occurring in her relations to other families, nor to practise her profession with thoroughness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6130"/>At the end of these <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> events favored a change in her circumstances, and the busy cares of a farmer's wife were exchanged for the quiet village home, with only her own family, consisting of husband and <num value="2">two</num> children, to occupy her. It was then, when her youngest child was <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> old, and some leisure offered, that she resumed her favorite study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6131"/>The books and maps, skeletons, and preparations of her brother-in-law, <persName n="Longshore,Professor,J.,S.,," id="n0202.0021.00540.02226" reg="default:Longshore,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Longshore</surname></persName>, who was also her preceptor, were at her service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6132"/>She proceeded with the usual course, and at the end of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> entered as a student the <quote>Female <orgName n="Medical College" type="college">Medical College of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName></orgName>,</quote> located in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6133"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session of that institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6134"/>At the close of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> session, in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, she was <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="10">ten</num> members who composed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> graduating class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6135"/>As an indication of regard for her qualifications, the faculty immediately elected her <quote>Demonstrator of anatomy,</quote> and she acceptably served the college in that capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6136"/>Her <quote>sign</quote> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> exhibited in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> by any female graduate in medicine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6137"/>The calls of patients were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few, and principally of the poorer lasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6138"/>It was found no easy matter for an entire <pb id="p.541" n="541"/> stranger, unheralded, to obtain practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6139"/>Ignorance, prejudice, and petty persecution were to be encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6140"/>Sneers and ridicule were the staple arguments against her. Some <hi rend="italics">gentlemen</hi> of the profession took special pains to array public sentiment against the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6141"/><quote>A woman's intellectual incapacity and her physical weaknesses will ever disqualify her for the duties.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6142"/><quote>She will either kill her patients or let them die.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6143"/><quote>It would be evidence of insanity or idiocy to employ her.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6144"/><quote>If you call in a woman you will have to call a man afterward, and no man will meet a woman in consultation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6145"/>These expressions were heard on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6146"/>With unwavering purpose and confidence in ultimate success, she was not discouraged, but availed herself of this enforced leisure, to prepare and deliver a course of <quote>Lectures to ladies on Medical subjects.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6147"/>She also delivered a carefully written lecture, on the <quote>Medical education of women,</quote> to a large and appreciative audience, in <num value="1">one</num> of the largest halls of the city, and repeated it, as well as the course to ladies, in other halls and churches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6148"/>These lectures, besides inducing consideration and right views upon the general subject, introduced her more fully to the public, and enabled her hearers to form some judgment of her qualifications for the duties she had assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6149"/>The result was, that, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, many of those who heard her called on her for advice and aid. By the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> year her practice had increased so that she was obliged to abandon all idea of further lectures, and also to resign her position as demonstrator in the college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6150"/>Since then it has steadily extended, until few physicians of either sex, and among women perhaps none, except <persName n="Lozier,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00541.02227" reg="mostcommon:Lozier,A.,W.,,:2"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Lozier</surname></persName>, can equal it. As many as <num value="300">three hundred</num> families in the city rely upon her exclusively for medical care, and it is no uncommon thing for her to prescribe for <num value="40">forty</num> patients in a day. Her practice is legitimate and general, that is, it includes all forms of disease, acute and chronic, in respectable family treatment, with surgery <pb id="p.542" n="542"/> among women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6151"/>Of the latter, she has had occasion to perform many extremely delicate and dangerous operations,--with what success, the best testimony that can be desired, is the growing confidence with which she is called upon by the most intelligent class of citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6152"/>The objection often urged against the introduction of female physicians,that they cannot endure the inevitable fatigues and exposures, --has met a practical answer in the instance of <persName n="Longshore,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00542.02228" reg="nearbymention:Longshore,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Longshore</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>Inheriting from her mother a delicate constitution, her early childhood was <num value="1">one</num> of sensitiveness and suffering, notwithstanding the benefit derived from the mode of life which we have described, judiciously regulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6154"/>At the age of <num value="15">fifteen</num> she very narrowly escaped from a prostrating and protracted attack, requiring many months for recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6155"/>At the time of graduation, the faculty predicted an early death from consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6156"/>Since then her weight has greatly increased, and she gives every token of vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6157"/>It is her conviction that her continued life and present degree of health are due to the active habits of the profession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6158"/><persName n="Longshore,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00542.02229" reg="nearbymention:Longshore,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Longshore</surname></persName> is constitutionally extremely diffident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6159"/>For many years she was so easily embarrassed that she dreaded and shunned society, beyond the limited circle of a few friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6160"/>To appear in public as a lecturer, and to visit strangers professionally, always required a struggle against this timidity and the habit of reserve; yet she has so far subdued it, by absorption in her objects, that it would hardly be detected in her deportment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6161"/>In appearance she is characterized by entire simplicity, equally removed from coarseness and from affectation; not adopting the <rs>Quaker</rs> costume and language, but plain in her mode of speech and dress, with an openness of countenance expressive of a truthful spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6162"/>Direct, unhesitating, and informal in her approach to a case; unpretending, and yet evidently assured in the exercise of her judgment; with a peculiar mingling of personal modesty <pb id="p.543" n="543"/> and professional positiveness, she inspires patients with immediate trust, which is rarely forfeited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6163"/>Cool, cheerful, rapid in her manner as physician, almost seeming to make light of their ailments, she leaves them refreshed by her visit, scarcely conscious of their need of condolence, and yet often before leaving the houses of those endeared to her by long acquaintance or dependence upon her care, she sheds the tears of a true woman and a sympathizing mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6164"/>Her mind acts with the quickness of intuition or of keen perceptions, and a brief interview, with a few questions, usually suffices to guide her in the choice of remedies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6165"/>In her selection of these, she is not governed by any routine, nor limited to <num value="1">one</num> school of medicine, but considers that she is at liberty to avail herself of any means which her experience has proved useful or the peculiarities of the case suggest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6166"/>For some time past, the prejudices which she at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encountered from the <quote>fraternity,</quote> especially under the pressure of resolutions early adopted by the county society and some other organizations, have yielded to the evidences of her ability; and now some of the leading physicians of the city freely meet her in consultation, while others, too much trammelled by regulations, or personal fears, to act openly, have recommended her to their female patients, and, in several instances, while publicly uniting in measures of opposition to women as practitioners, have privately sent to her for treatment their own wives and daughters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6167"/>In the midst of these exacting and exhausting claims upon her time, <persName n="Longshore,Mrs.,,,," id="n0202.0021.00543.02230" reg="nearbymention:Longshore,J.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Longshore</surname></persName> is, in her domestic relations, affectionate and faithful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6168"/>Her husband and children are preferred above all other objects of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6169"/>Without them, she often declares that life would lose its chief charm to her,--a declaration the sincerity of which they and her intimate friends fully credit and abundantly testify, and which is confirmed by the order of her household, and by her readiness at any <pb id="p.544" n="544"/> time to consult their comfort at the sacrifice of her own. Her warm and active sympathy, also, with every movement promising benefit for the wronged, the oppressed, and suffering, especially to those of her own sex, is well known among her friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6170"/>Her gratuitous labors among the poor she has always felt to be a duty, and congenial to her disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6171"/>She never knowingly accepts a fee from the needy, while she is constantly distributing food, clothing, and other comforts, gathered from every source within her reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6172"/>Not so much marked by the devotional element, or uplifting spirituality, as some whom we have already noticed, she is certainly abundant in those fruits of pure and undefiled religion, which consist in visiting the widow and the fatherless in their affliction, and keeping unspotted from the world, and we trust is actuated in it by the divine precept <quote>to do good and to communicate; for with such sacrifices <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is well pleased.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6194"/>During that period, also, she shared largely with true-hearted men and women in earnest efforts of general philanthropy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6195"/>Her influence in these directions was distinctly marked, while in the genial domestic circle, amid all her practical duties, she was cultivating a refined taste, often evinced in poetic effusions, whose pure sentiments have been appreciated by many readers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6196"/>To a mind like hers, uniting keen sensibilities with energy of purpose and breadth of aim, the charms of such a home must have been great, while the impulse to pass beyond its limitations was equally strong.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6197"/>The years, however, passed on profitably and happily, until she reached maturity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6198"/>She would long before have entered some wider and less secluded path, had not her mother's continued need of assistance, while <num value="6">six</num> brothers were reaching manhood, seemed an imperative claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6665"/>I have reason to be grateful to you for this distinction, because I am a young artist; and, though I may have given some evidence of skill in those of my statues which are now in your city, I could scarcely have hoped that their merit, whatever it may be, should have inspired the citizens of <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> to entrust me with a work whose chief characteristic must be the union of great intellectual power with manly strength.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6668"/>I utter these sentiments only to assure you that I am fully aware of the important results which to me as an artist wait on the issue of my labors, and hence, that I shall spare no pains to produce a monument worthy of your city, and worthy of the statesman who, though dead, still speaks to you in language <pb id="p.585" n="585"/> more eloquent and enduring than the happiest efforts in marble and bronze of ever so cunning a workman.</p>
