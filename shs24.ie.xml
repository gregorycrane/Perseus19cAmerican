<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The heroic in history but seldom occurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It is not often that the life of nations rises above the monotonous level which characterizes the daily routine of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>When such periods do occur they are usually as a part of some great national uprising like the <hi rend="italics">leve en masse</hi> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> under the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0282.0002.00001.00003" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, or the <name>Landsturm</name> in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Of the <rs>American States</rs>, none can show a fairer record in this respect than <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>There is little in the <name>Colonial</name> or State history of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> that is discreditable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The key-note to the whole of her Colonial history is unending opposition to unjust and illegal government, by whom or whenever exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Before the colony was well in its teens it had expelled <num value="1">one</num> of its governors from office, and a better man, <num value="1">one</num> who was more in sympathy with the people, had taken his place; and before the colony was <num value="30">thirty</num>, another governor, although <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Lords Proprietors</rs> had been impeached, deprived of his office, and expelled the province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was this fearlessness in what they conceived to be their rights that carried her people through the troublous period of the <q direct="unspecified">Cary Rebellion,</q> so called; enabled them to meet with a firm <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> hand the brow-beating and the villainies, as well as the flattery, of proprietary and royal governors and put them among the leaders in the movement that culminated in the <name>Revolution</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Then came a time of peace and calm when the people pursued the even tenor of their way, and sought in field and forum to find solution for the problems amid which their lot was cast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This period lasted for about <num value="2">two</num> generations, and during it the <rs>University</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> had been founded and was seeking a greater expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>During the period from the end of the <name>Revolution</name> to the <rs>Civil War</rs> there are no mountain peaks in her history; the level of uniformity is hardly broken by a single event of importance, and there is little in it to attract the attention of the student of the philosophy of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But there is a period in the history of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> which stands pre-eminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There is a time which deserves to be characterized as the heroic <rs>Peroid</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This is the period of the <rs>Civil War</rs> and Reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Let all other parts of our history be forgotten, this period of itself, though it be less than half a generation in all, will place <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> among the heroic in history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>During those terrible years we see a renaissance of the ideas which characterized pre-eminently the men of the <name>Colonial</name> period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The men of &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num> showed that the spirit of Colonial <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> was still abroad in the land, and their watchword became again resistance to what they believed to be unjust government, and with this as a basis they conducted a struggle for success that has few parallels in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They sought to carry out again the program of their colonial ancestors, even to the impeachment and deposition of their governor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the movement which led up to the war <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> took the part of a conservative, ambitious for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>She sought to escape the necessity of war by all the means in her power; but, when the die was cast and war was no longer avoidable, she entered into the struggle with characteristic energy, and prosecuted it to the end, and when the end came, no State accepted the crushing defeat with more steadfast loyalty than <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, or sought with more energy to build up the waste places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then came what was worse than defeat, <q direct="unspecified">impartial suffrage,</q> which meant disfranchisement of whites and enfranchisement of blacks, then the terrors of reconstruction and negro rule broke over us like the roar of some terrible simoon, bearing in its path further humiliation, accompanied by a corrupt government, increased taxes, and a depreciation of values.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><pb id="p.3" n="3"/> Such was the struggle through which the best men of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> were called to pass in those fateful years between <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>These were the years on which the fate of the future in a large measure depended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Well did the brave men of that generation come to the succor of the foundering ship of State, and nobly did they rescue her from the rule of her motley crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The best men of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> were engaged in this work, and among them, most frequently as leaders, were many alumni of the <rs>University</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.</p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>The city of <placeName reg="Helena, Phillips, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008470">Helena</placeName> lies in the lowlands on the <rs>Arkansas</rs> shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>Its water front was guarded by the gunboat <hi rend="italics">dyler</hi>, famous at <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Forts Henry</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>On the land side there was an unbroken chain of fortifications extending from the river bank above the town to the bank below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>The western front of the city was about half a mile in length and just outside the limits, nearly opposite the centre, was a heavy earthwork, mounting siege guns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>I give you these details to show that the contract was a good-sized <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>Yet there was a heap in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>The <rs>Yankees</rs> had but <num value="4000">4,000</num> men in <placeName reg="Helena, Phillips, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008470">Helena</placeName>, and although they had plenty of cannon they lacked the trained artillerists to handle them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>The gunners that day were green hands detailed from the <orgName type="regiment" key="33MOInfantry">33d Missouri Infantry</orgName>, and the way they handled the pieces made us wish we had met another kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>But we knew very little of the actual situation until we struck it all of a sudden about daylight on Independence Day. Our <num value="3">three</num> columns, <persName n="Marmaduke,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00198.03097" reg="mostcommon:Marmaduke,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmaduke</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00198.03098" reg="nearbymention:Price,William,H.,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s, and <persName n="Fagan,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00198.03099" reg="mostcommon:Fagan,nomatch:0"><surname>Fagan</surname></persName>'s, told off in storming parties and reserves, moved against the batteries and intrenchments lying across our paths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>There were <num value="6">six</num> roads from the interior to the town, and the defenders, being ignorant as to the particular <num value="1">one</num> or ones we would use, were compelled to watch them all. Our brigade attempted to take along some <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, but about a mile out from the lines we found the road obstructed, and on both sides of it the country was cut up into ravines, making it impassible for cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>Our officers were obliged to dismount and leave the horses behind, and our men, with free use of limb, barely made their way through the labyrinth of obstructions in time to meet the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>We were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to open the ball, and as soon as the straggling line could pull itself together it moved forward in battle order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>Here a gorge intervened; there a steep hillside loomed before us, and the thicket and trenches in front were alive with sharpshooting riflemen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>The <num value="3">three</num> regiments of the brigade charged on both sides of the road, and soon after daylight had carried <num value="4">four</num> lines of rifle pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>But there had been no attack at any other point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>The day was frightfully hot, and our poor fellows soon began to drop from heat and exhaustion as well as from <name>Yankee</name> bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>The guns on <placeName key="possibilities=17" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Graveyard Hill</placeName> were abreast of us, and poured their shots among our scattered men. It was with relief that we saw <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00198.03100" reg="nearbymention:Price,William,H.,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s line march to the assault of that battery, and as they did so we rallied for <num value="1">one</num> more <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> charge on the last remaining rifle pits on <placeName reg="Hindman Hill">Hindman Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>That we carried, and the enemy fled to the shelter of <placeName reg="Fort Curtis">Fort Curtis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>On abandoning the guns to us the <rs>Missouri</rs> novices had the cunning to spike the pieces, or we would have turned them upon the walls of <placeName reg="Fort Curtis">Fort Curtis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>It was while attempting to drill out <num value="1">one</num> of the guns for a shot at the old flag that I lost my arms by a shell from the gunboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>My hands were together in a line, and all at once I wondered why I could not twist the worm I had held a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>Men who saw me say I stared and grinned like a madman, not knowing what had happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>When at last I realized what had happened, I ran forward in the charge with our men toward the ditch of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>Not only the gunboat fire, but that of the fort itself, which was bastioned, raked the walls, and our men were terribly repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>There was no hope but surrender, and our sharpshooters back in the rear shot down every man who attempted to go into the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>So we were between <num value="2">two</num> fires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>We might have been saved yet had not <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00199.03101" reg="nearbymention:Price,William,H.,,"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s men made a terrible blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2654"/>They were ordered to carry <placeName key="possibilities=17" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Graveyard Hill</placeName>, which they did most gallantly, and instead of pressing on in our flank and rear to support us in the assault of <placeName reg="Fort Curtis">Fort Curtis</placeName>, they passed on to the town itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>Seeing no way of escape to the rear of our column, I joined them, and lay for <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> in a house by the wayside, where my wounds were dressed by a surgeon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/> Meantime the gunboat firing and the fusillade from <placeName reg="Fort Curtis">Fort Curtis</placeName> sweeping the ground over which we had charged, retreat over the same line was out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>I made my way towards the outposts on the north, and had the good luck to fall in with <orgName n="Mariaduke's Cav"><persName n="Mariaduke,Cav,,,," id="n0282.0034.00199.03102" reg="mostcommon:Mariaduke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Cav"></roleName><surname>Mariaduke</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="cavalry">cavalry</orgName></orgName>, which had charged upon the battery north of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>I struck <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Shelby,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00199.03103" reg="mostcommon:Shelby,Joe,,,:3"><surname>Shelby</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, and that ended my adventures that terrible <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>; but as I have talked chiefly of my deeds and those of my own command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>I wish to add a little incident to show that heroes were all over the field that day. <persName n="Shelby,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00199.03104" reg="mostcommon:Shelby,Joe,,,:3"><surname>Shelby</surname></persName> had with him that famous battery of <orgName n="Flying Artillery" type="artillery">flying artillery</orgName>, manned by <quote><persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00199.03105" reg="mostcommon:Dick,Robert,P.,,:2"><surname>Dick</surname></persName></quote> <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0282.0034.00199.03106" reg="mostcommon:Collins,Charles,N.,,:6"><surname>Collins</surname></persName>, and known on all the border for the spirit with which it entered a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>The duties of the regiment were to guard the river shore with an extended line of pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>These pickets were frequently aroused and entertained by the passage up the river of Federal gunboats and transports, communicating with <orgName n="army"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0282.0039.00213.03289" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>Quite frequently, also, an exchange of rifle shots was made with the <rs>Federal</rs> pickets on the <rs>Northern Neck</rs> shore of the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>Many men of this regiment had their homes and families on that side of the river, and the sight of the <rs>Union</rs> horsemen riding unchecked over the roads and fields so familiar to them aroused in many breasts an intense desire to cross the river and strike the enemy a blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>Into this feeling none entered more heartily than the <rs>Colonel</rs> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>Accordingly, scouts were dispatched to ascertain the enemy's exact position, strength, disposition of sentinels, and also to search for boats sufficient to carry over several <num value="100">hundred</num> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>An application was at the same time forwarded to headquarters for permission to cross the river with <num value="300">300</num> men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>The scouts carefully noted the houses in which the men of this squadron slept, where their horses were picketed, and how their sentinels were posted at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>Only <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> boats&mdash;a large batteau and a skiff&mdash;could be secured, and these were duly provided with oars and concealed in a marshy creek, a mile or <num value="2">two</num> above <placeName key="tgn,2112639" n="1.000 1" reg="Leedstown, Westmoreland, Virginia">Leedstown</placeName>, in readiness for use.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>In consequence, the purpose of attacking the entire Federal regiment, was abandoned, and a plan arranged for capturing the squadron at <placeName key="tgn,2112639" n="1.000 1" reg="Leedstown, Westmoreland, Virginia">Leedstown</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>The night was cold and dark, and it was necessary to maintain the strictest silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>The boats were rowed noislessly out into the river, the officers in charge having a preconcerted plan to rendezvous at a given point on the other shore, in the event of becoming separated in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>This proved a wise precaution, for the boats became quickly lost to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>The skiff being light and easily managed, shot straight across and quickly reached the other shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>The larger boat drifted down with the tide, and grounded on a sand-bar far out in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>It was necessary for a number of the men to get out into the icy-water, waist deep, and push the craft over the bar by main force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>A landing was made by <persName n="Waller,Major,,,," id="n0282.0039.00214.03296" reg="nearbymention:Waller,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Waller</surname></persName>'s party half a mile lower down the river than had been contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>There were <num value="6">six</num> of these, at as many different points, and it needed much adroitness and boldness of action to secure them all without an alarm being made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>The plan was for <num value="2">two</num> men to get in rear of each picket, and <num value="2">two</num> to advance upon them quietly in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>If <num value="1">one</num> set failed to bag the game, it was thought the other would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>And so it proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>The pickets were captured without breaking the stillness of the night with the faintest alarm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>Having secured the outer guards, it was next necessary to capture the reserve guards, who were <num value="15">fifteen</num> in number, and occupied a vacant store in <placeName key="tgn,2112639" n="1.000 1" reg="Leedstown, Westmoreland, Virginia">Leedstown</placeName>, where they slept on their arms, having their horses saddled and bridled, close at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>From the shadow of an adjacent house, as we drew near to the store, the form of the sentinel was descried under the porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>The moon was just rising, throwing a gleam on the river, the sound of whose flowing only disturbed the perfect stillness of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>Our pause was but for a moment, when a dash was made for the steps leading up to the door of the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>The startled sentinel ran for the steps, too, without pausing to fire his carbine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>The Union horsemen in the store were made prisoners by the time they had well cast aside the blankets under which they had been cosily sleeping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>Indeed, so rapid and sudden had we fallen on the unsuspecting sleepers that some of them were assisted by us in waking, by having their blankets pulled off them by our own hands.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>The demand to surrender was answered from doors and windows by small volleys, which fired in the dark, did no harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>When the prisoners had been got together, it was found that <num value="49">forty-nine</num> had been here captured, with their horses, saddles, bridles, arms and accoutrements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>The problem now was, how to get the prisoners and horses across the river, which was nearly a mile in width.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>A large lighter, capable of carrying <num value="100">one hundred</num> men, or more, was found near the water's edge at <placeName key="tgn,2112639" n="1.000 1" reg="Leedstown, Westmoreland, Virginia">Leedstown</placeName>, and this was quickly launched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>The prisoners were put into it, with a suitable guard of men, and the boat was speedily poled over (as the watermen say), to the <rs>Essex</rs> shore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>The approach of daylight, and the prospect of a gunboat's appearance, made the passage of the captured horses a hazardous undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>It was decided to take the horses <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> higher up the river, where the stream was narrower, and the banks higher, where better security was offered against gunboats, and a better opportunity could be found for swimming over the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>The <num value="2">two</num> boats were rowed up to the latter point, where, after the arrival of the men with the horses, the saddles, blankets, and arms were put in the boats, and the horses were all lashed together by their halter-reins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>If you were surprised at not finding in my book your name mentioned in connection with torpedoes, I was certainly not less so at your arraignment of me as having done you an injustice by the omission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>If you will refer to the preface of the book you will see in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> paragraph the announcement of the purpose for which it was written; and on the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> page the reason for numerous omissions of events entitled to consideration, as well as the expression of the hope that such omissions would be more than supplied by the reports and contributions of the actors in those events.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>The motive which impelled me to an unwonted labor, that of writing a book, was from historical data to vindicate the cause of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and to show that their conduct was worthy of their cause; a brief narration of military, naval, and civil affairs was annexed; but the reader was notified that I did not attempt to give an accurate account of all the important transactions of the war. Your letter indicates that you feel aggrieved because of <persName n="Rains,General,G.,J.,," id="n0282.0053.00288.04368" reg="default:Rains,G.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName> being alone mentioned in connection with torpedoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>You infer that it will hereafter be supposed he was awarded the whole credit for that means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>I do not see that the text justifies such a conclusion, for on the page to which you refer me&mdash;<num value="207">207</num>, Vol. <num value="2">2</num>&mdash;I wrote of torpedoes as a means known but undeveloped, adding: <q direct="unspecified">It remained for the skill and ingenuity of our officers to bring the use of this terrible instrument to a perfection.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/></p> 
<p>At a date long before this perfection had been attained <persName n="Rains,General,,,," id="n0282.0053.00288.04369" reg="nearbymention:Rains,G.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName> is named incidentally with the order putting him in charge of submarine defences and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rudely constructed torpedo at <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>See <ref n="page 97">page 97</ref>, Vol. <num value="2">2</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3835"/>On <ref n="page 102">page 102</ref>, Vol. <num value="2">2</num>, you may see to what I attributed the repulse of the enemy's fleet at <placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName>, and that the enemy, like myself, thought it was our artillerists and riflemen who disabled and drove off the fleet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>It seems to me that the remark <q direct="unspecified">the secret of all his (<persName n="Rains,,,,," id="n0282.0053.00288.04370" reg="nearbymention:Rains,G.,J.,,"><surname>Rains</surname></persName>') future success consisted in the sensitive primer,</q> is by no means a denial that success was obtained by other persons employing different methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>The description of the simple torpedoes employed by him was evidently not intended to apply to the large mines with electrical batteries of others, or to the various forms of torpedo vessels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>To our embarrassed condition I thought and think the small percussion torpedoes were best adapted, because an electric station, unless adequately protected, was liable to capture by a boat's crew, which would render the mine useless, and also because the mine with its battery was expensive, and had on an important occasion proved a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/><pb id="p.289" n="289"/></p> 
<p>If you read the <q direct="unspecified">Southern Historical Papers,</q> you must have observed how frequent are the contributions in regard to events of the war, and it has been my ardent wish that all who acted the patriots' part in our conflict, should publish in papers of the <name>Society</name>, a full account of whatever was specially known by them, so that its files should be a reservoir of facts for the use of the future historian.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>If I had kown of the success mentioned by you, especially the daring feat of attacking the <term type="ship">flagship</term> <rs type="ship">Minnesota</rs> in a steam launch, I should doubtlesa have found space for an act of devotion like that of <persName n="Glassell,,,,," id="n0282.0053.00289.04371" reg="mostcommon:Glassell,nomatch:0"><surname>Glassell</surname></persName>, but I should not have given to the narrative the graphic effect, which you, as the actor, can throw into it, nor have shown as you may the efficiency of the spar torpedo.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>I hope that many officers that performed good service with torpedoes, may not think themselves treated with injustice because not named by me, but the rather find themselves included in the general notice quoted above, and sympathizing in the desire for a complete record, will do what I could not in contributing full reports of their services.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>When I undertook the task of defending our cause, it was with the expectation of hostile criticism from our adversary, and with the readiness to encounter that.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>The quarters were made rather uncomfortable for us. Occasionally a shell would explode before reaching the wharf, in the road, or the main street that leads up into the village, which caused some excitement and solicitude for a brief while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>Only a few casualties, however, resulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>The enemy's position from where our steamer was being shelled was probably <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure> distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>Fragments of shell flew promiscuously about the steamer, though doing no material damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>While on the steamer I saw a piece of shell strike a pile of wood near the engine, scattering it in various directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>The engineer was knocked down, and escaped with slight injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>As soon as practicable we disembarked our cannon, &amp;c., at once proceeded up the street, through the village, and filed to the right of our army, where we remained temporarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>Just as soon as the shadow of darkness came on we moved a short distance to the left and encamped that night in a ravine.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>The weather was very severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>This order was rather unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>Breakfast was being prepared at the time, and there was much confusion in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>The battle soon began, and the rattle of musketry and boom of cannon continued until about <time value="1pm">1 o'clock P. M.</time> The enemy had superior numbers, and was frequently reinforced during the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>The Confederates were continuously engaged in the battle without relief or reinforcement, yet, under the disadvantages the enemy was driven back probably <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>, sustaining considerable loss, and the <rs>Confederates</rs> occupied his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>A gun from my battery, with my detachment, and other troops, was ordered in pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>After proceeding a short distance this order was countermanded, and we returned to our original position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>The reason for this was, that in view of information received, the enemy having been heavily reinforced, the undertaking would have been <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> hazardous, probably involving a great sacrifice on our part.
