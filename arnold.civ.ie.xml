<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Certainly the book has had no wide circulation here, it has not been much read or much discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>There are obvious reasons for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The book relates in great detail the military history of the <rs>American Civil War</rs>, so far as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00003.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> bore part in it; such a history cannot possibly have for other nations the interest which it has for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>For the general reader outside of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, it certainly cannot; as to the value and importance of the history to the military specialist, that is a question on which I hear very conflicting opinions expressed, and <num value="1">one</num> on which I myself can <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>have, of course, no opinion to offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>So far as the general <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> reader might still be attracted to such a history, in spite of its military details, for the sake of the importance of the issues at stake and of the personages engaged, we in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have, it cannot be denied, in approaching an American recital of the deeds of <quote>the greatest nation upon earth,</quote> some apprehension and mistrust to get over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We may be pardoned for doubting whether we shall in the recital find measure, whether we shall find sobriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Then, too, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0064.0001.00004.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the central figure of these <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi>, is not to the <rs>English</rs> imagination the hero of the <rs>American Civil War</rs>; the hero is <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00004.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00004.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> the <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi> tell us little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Moreover <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0064.0001.00004.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, when he was in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, did not himself personally interest people much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Later he fell in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> into the hands of financing speculators, and his embarrassments, though they excited sorrow and compassion, did not at all present themselves to us as those of <quote>a good man struggling with adversity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>For all these reasons, then, the <hi rend="italics">Personal Memoirs</hi> have in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> been received with coldness and indifference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I, too, had seen <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0064.0001.00004.00012" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and did not find him interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If I said the truth, I should say that I thought him ordinary-looking, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>dull and silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>An expression of gentleness and even sweetness in the eyes, which the portraits in the <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi> show, escaped me. A strong, resolute, business-like man, who by possession of unlimited resources in men and money, and by the unsparing use of them, had been enabled to wear down and exhaust the strength of the <rs>South</rs>, this was what I supposed <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00005.00013" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to be, this and little more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Some documents published by <persName n="Badeau,General,,,," id="n0064.0001.00005.00014" reg="mostcommon:Badeau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Badeau</surname></persName> in the <rs>American</rs> newspapers <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attracted my serious attention to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00005.00015" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Among those documents was a letter from him which showed qualities for which, in the rapid and uncharitable view which our cursory judgments of men so often take, I had by no means given him credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was the letter of a man with the virtue, rare everywhere, but more rare in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, perhaps, than anywhere else, the virtue of being able to confront and resist popular clamour, the <hi rend="italics">civium ardor prava jubentium</hi>. Public opinion seemed in favour of a hard and insolent course, the authorities seemed putting pressure upon <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00005.00016" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to make him follow it. He resisted with firmness and dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>After reading that letter I turned to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0064.0001.00005.00017" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Personal Memoirs</hi>, then just published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This man, I said to myself, deserves respect and attention; and I read the <num value="2">two</num> bulky volumes through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>I found shown in them a man, strong, resolute, and business-like, as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0064.0001.00006.00018" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had appeared to me when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw him; a man with no magical personality, touched by no divine light and giving out none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I found a language all astray in its use of <hi rend="italics">will</hi> and <hi rend="italics">shall, should</hi> and <hi rend="italics">would</hi>, an English employing the verb <hi rend="italics">to conscript</hi> and the participle <hi rend="italics">conscripting</hi>, and speaking in a despatch to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> of having <hi rend="italics">badly whipped</hi> the enemy; an English without charm and without high breeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But at the same time I found a man of sterling good-sense as well as of the firmest resolution; a man, withal, humane, simple, modest; from all restless self-consciousness and desire for display perfectly free; never boastful where he himself was concerned, and where his nation was concerned seldom boastful, boastful only in circumstances where nothing but high genius or high training, I suppose, can save an American from being boastful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I found a language straightforward, nervous, firm, possessing in general the high merit of saying clearly in the fewest possible words what had to be said, and saying it, frequently, with shrewd and unexpected turns of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <hi rend="italics">Memoirs</hi> renewed and completed the expression which the letter given by <persName n="Badeau,General,,,," id="n0064.0001.00006.00019" reg="mostcommon:Badeau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Badeau</surname></persName> had made upon me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>I am sure I hope they are, for, as I have just said, I have been long convinced that <name>English</name> society has to transform itself, and long looking in vain for a model by which we might be guided and inspired in the bringing forth of our new civilization; and here is the model ready to hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>But I own <pb id="p.79" n="79"/>that hitherto I have thought that, as we in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> have to transform our civilization, so <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> has hers still to make; and that, though her example and co-operation might, and probably would, be of the greatest value to us in the future, yet they were not of much use to our civilization now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>And when I came upon the <rs>Boston</rs> newspaper's assurances that, in almost every small town of the <rs>Union</rs>, I should find <quote>an elegant and simple social order,</quote> the comment which rose to my lips was this: <quote>I suspect what I should find there, in great force, is Striker.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Now Striker was a Philistine.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>I have said somewhere or other that, whereas our society in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> distributes itself into Barbarians, Philistines, and Populace, <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> is just ourselves, with the <name>Barbarians</name> quite left <pb id="p.80" n="80"/>out, and the <name>Populace</name> nearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>That this should be the case seemed to me natural, and that it actually was the case, everything which I could hear and read about <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> tended to convince me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>We, too, have groups of this kind everywhere, and we know what they can do for us and what they cannot do. It is easy to praise them, to flatter them, to express unbounded satisfaction with them, to speak as if they gave us all that we needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>I should say, for my part, though I have not, I fully own, the means for judging accurately, that all this points to an American development of our Murdstone and Quinion, the bitter Philistine and the rowdy Philistine, exhibiting themselves in conjunction, exhibiting themselves with great luxuriance and with very little check.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>As I write from <address><street n="Grub Street">Grub Street</street></address>, I will add that, to my mind, the condition of the copyright question between us and <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> appears to point <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>to just the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The American refusal of copyright to us poor <name>English</name> souls is just the proceeding which would naturally commend itself to Murdstone and Quinion; and the way in which <persName n="Conant,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0002.00101.00353" reg="mostcommon:Conant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Conant</surname></persName> justifies and applauds the proceeding, and continues to justify and applaud it, in disregard of all that <num value="1">one</num> may say, and boldly turns the tables upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, is just the way in which Murdstone and Quinion, after regulating copyright in the <rs>American</rs> fashion, would wish and expect to be backed up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>And no doubt a few <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0064.0002.00101.00355" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, highly civilized individuals, <quote>hopping backwards and forwards over the <rs>Atlantic</rs>,</quote> much disapprove of these words and works of <persName n="Conant,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0002.00101.00356" reg="mostcommon:Conant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Conant</surname></persName> and his constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>But can there be constant groups of children of light, joined in an elegant order, everywhere throughout the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>for, if there were, would not their sense of equity, and their sense of delicacy, and even their sense of the ridiculous, be too strong, even in this very matter of copyright, for <persName n="Conant,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0002.00101.00357" reg="mostcommon:Conant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Conant</surname></persName> and his constituents?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>But on the creation and propagation of such groups the civilized life of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> depends for its future, as the civilized life of our own country, too, depends for its future upon the same <pb id="p.102" n="102"/>thing;--so much is certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>And if <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> succeeds in creating and installing hers, before we succeed in creating and installing ours, then they will send over help to us from <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, and will powerfully influence us for our good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Let us see, then, how we both of us stand at the present moment, and what advantages the <num value="1">one</num> of us has which are wanting to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>We in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> have liberty and industry and the sense for conduct, and a splendid aristocracy which feels the need for beauty and manners, and a unique class, as <persName n="Sumner,Mister,Charles,,," id="n0064.0002.00102.00358" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> pointed out, of gentlemen, not of the landed class or of the nobility, but cultivated and refined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/><placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> has not our splendid aristocracy, but then this splendid aristocracy is materialized, and for helping the sense for beauty, or the sense for social life and manners, in the nation at large, it does nothing or next to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>So we must not hastily pronounce, with <persName n="Vivian,Mister,Hussey,,," id="n0064.0002.00102.00359" reg="default:Vivian,Hussey,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Hussey</foreName> <surname>Vivian</surname></persName>, that American civilization suffers by its absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Indeed they are themselves developing, it is said, a class of very rich people quite sufficiently materialized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/><placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> has not our large and unique class of gentlemen; something of it they have, of course, but it is not by any manner of means on the same scale there as here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Acting by itself, and untrammelled, <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> our <name>English</name> class of gentlemen has eminent merits; our rule in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, of which we may well be proud, is in great measure its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>But in presence of a great force of Barbarian power, as in this country, or in presence of a great force of Philistinism, our class of gentlemen, as we know, has not much faith and ardor, is somewhat bounded and ineffective, is not much of a civilized force for the nation at large; not much more, perhaps, than the few <quote>rather civilized individuals</quote> in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, who, according to our <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> informant, go <quote>hopping backwards and forwards over the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Perhaps <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, with her needs, has no very great loss in not having our special class of gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Without this class, and without the pressure and false ideal of our Barbarians, the <rs>Americans</rs> have, like ourselves, the sense for conduct and religion; they have industry, and they have liberty; they have, too, over and above what we have, they have an excellent thing &mdash; equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>But we have seen reason for thinking, that as we in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, with our aristocracy, gentlemen, liberty, industry, religion, and sense for conduct, have the civilization of the most important part of our people, the immense middle class, impaired by a defective type of religion, a narrow range of intellect and <pb id="p.104" n="104"/>knowledge, a stunted sense of beauty, a low standard of manners; so in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, too, where this class is yet more important and all-pervading than it is here, civilization suffers in the like way. With a people of our stock it could not, indeed, well be otherwise, so long as this people can be truly described as <quote>the most commonschooled and least cultivated people in the world.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>The real cultivation of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as of the <rs>English</rs> middle class, has been in and by its religion, its <quote><num value="1">one</num> thing needful.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>But the insufficiency of this religion is now every day becoming more manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>It deals, indeed, with personages and words which have an indestructible and inexhaustible truth and salutariness; but it is rooted and grounded in preternaturalism, it can receive those personages and those words only on conditions of preternaturalism, and a religion of preternaturalism is doomed &mdash; whether with or without the battle of Armageddon for which <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Salisbury</foreName></persName> is preparing &mdash; to inevitable dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/><hi rend="italics">Fidelity to conscience</hi>! cries the popular <rs>Protestanism</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, and thinks that it has said enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>But the modern analysis relentlessly scrutinizes this conscience, and compels it to give an account of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>What sort <pb id="p.105" n="105"/>of a conscience?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>a true conscience or a false <num value="1">one</num>? <quote>Conscience is the most changing of rules; conscience is presumptuous in the strong, timid in the weak and unhappy, wavering in the undecided; obedient organ of the sentiment which sways us and of the opinions which govern us; more misleading than reason and nature.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>So says <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest and purest of moralists, Vauvenargues; and terrible as it may be to the popular <rs>Protestanism</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> to hear it, Vauvenargues thus describes with perfect truth that conscience to which popular Protestanism appeals as its supposed unshakable ground of reliance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>And now, having up to this point neglected all the arts of the controversialist, having merely made inquiries of my American friends as to the real state of their civilization, inquiries which they are free to answer in their own favor if they like, I am going to leave the advantage with them to the end. They kindly offered me the example of their civilization as a help to mend ours; and I, not with any vain Anglicism, for I own our insular civilization to be very unsatisfactory, but from a desire to get at the truth and not to deceive myself with hopes of help from <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> where at present there is none to be found, have inquired whether <pb id="p.106" n="106"/>the <rs>Americans</rs> really think, on looking into the matter, that their civilization is much more satisfactory than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>And in case they should come to the conclusion, after due thought, that neither the <num value="1">one</num> civilization nor the other is in a satisfactory state, let me end by propounding a remedy which really it is heroic in me to propound, for people are bored to death, they say, by me with it, and every time I mention it I make new enemies and diminish the small number of friends that I have now. Still, I cannot help asking whether the defects of American civilization, if it is defective, may not probably be connected with the <rs>American</rs> people's being, as <persName n="Lowell,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0002.00106.00360" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lowell</surname></persName> says, <quote>the most common-schooled and the least cultivated people in the world.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>A higher, larger cultivation, a finer lucidity, is what is needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The friends of civilization, instead of hopping backwards and forwards over the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, should stay at home a while, and do their best to make the administration, the tribunals, the theatre, the arts, in each state, to make them become visible ideals to raise, purge, and ennoble the public sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Though they may be few in number, the friends of civilization will find, probably, that by a serious apostolate of this kind they can accomplish a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>But the really fruitful reform to be looked <pb id="p.107" n="107"/>for in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, so far as I can judge, is the very same reform which is so urgently required here &mdash; a reform of secondary instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>The primary and common schools of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> we all know; their praise is in every <num value="1">one</num>'s mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>About superior or University instruction <num value="1">one</num> need not be uneasy, it excites so much ambition, is so much in view, and is required by comparatively so small a number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>An institution like <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> is probably all that <num value="1">one</num> could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>But really good secondary schools, to form a due proportion of the youth of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> from the age of <num value="12">twelve</num> to the age of <num value="18">eighteen</num>, and then every year to throw a supply of them, thus formed, into circulation &mdash; this is what <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, I believe, wants, as we also want it, and what she possesses no more than we do. I know she has higher schools, I know their programme: Latin, <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, <name>German</name>, <name>French</name>, Surveying, Chemistry, Astrology, Natural History, Mental Philosophy, Constitution, Bookkeeping, Trigonometry, etc. Alas, to quote Vauvenargues again: <quote lang="fr">On ne corrigera jamais les hommes d'apprendre des choses inutiles!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>But good secondary schools, not with the programme of our classical and commercial academies, but with a serious programme &mdash; a programme really suited to the wants and capacities of those who are to be <pb id="p.108" n="108"/>trained &mdash; this, I repeat, is what American civilization in my belief most requires, as it is what our civilization, too, at present most requires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>The special present defects of both American civilization and ours are the kind of defects for which this is a natural remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>I commend it to the attention of my friendly <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> critic in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>; and some months hence, perhaps, when <persName n="Barnum,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0002.00108.00361" reg="mostcommon:Barnum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barnum</surname></persName> begins to require less space for his chronicles of Jumbo, my critic will tell me what he thinks of it. <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>Not at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> only, but almost wherever I went, I was asked whether I myself did not intend to write a book about <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>For oneself <num value="1">one</num> can answer yet more confidently than for <num value="1">one</num>'s friends, and I always replied that most assuredly I had no such intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>To write a book about <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, on the strength of having made merely such a tour there as mine was, and with no fuller equipment of preparatory studies and of local observations than I possess, would seem to me an impertinence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>It is now a long while since I read <persName n="Tocqueville,,M.,,,de" id="n0064.0003.00111.00362" reg="expanded:Tocqueville,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>'s famous work on Democracy in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>I have the highest respect for <persName n="Tocqueville,,M.,,,de" id="n0064.0003.00111.00363" reg="expanded:Tocqueville,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>; but my remembrance of his book is that it deals too much in abstractions for my <pb id="p.112" n="112"/>taste, and that it is written, moreover, in a style which many <name>French</name> writers adopt, but which I find trying &mdash; a style cut into short paragraphs and wearing an air of rigorous scientific deduction without the reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Very likely, however, I do <persName n="Tocqueville,,M.,,,de" id="n0064.0003.00112.00364" reg="expanded:Tocqueville,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName> injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>My debility in high speculation is well known, and I mean to attempt his book on Democracy again when I have seen <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> once more, and when years may have brought to me, perhaps, more of the philosophic mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Meanwhile, however, it will be evident how serious a matter I think it to write a worthy book about the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, when I am not entirely satisfied with even <persName n="Tocqueville,,M.,,,de" id="n0064.0003.00112.00365" reg="expanded:Tocqueville,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>'s.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>But before I went to <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, and when I had no expectation of ever going there, I published, under the title of <quote>A word about <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>,</quote> not indeed a book, but a few modest remarks on what I thought civilization in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> might probably be like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>I had before me a Boston newspaper article, which said that if I ever visited <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> I should find there such and such things; and taking this article for my text I observed that from all I had read and all I could judge I should for my part expect to find there rather such and such other things, which I mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>I said that <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>of aristocracy, as we know it here, I should expect to find, of course, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the total absence; that our lower class I should expect to find absent in a great degree, while my old familiar friend, the middle class, I should expect to find in full possession of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>And then betaking myself to those playful phrases which a little relieve, perhaps, the tedium of grave disquisitions of this sort, I said that I imagined <num value="1">one</num> would just have in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> our Philistines, with our aristocracy quite left out, and our populace very nearly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>An acute and singularly candid American, whose name I will on no account betray to his countrymen, read these observations of mine, and he made a remark upon them to me which struck me a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Yes, he said, you are right, and your supposition is just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>In general, what you would find over there would be the <name>Philistines</name>, as you call them, without your aristocracy and without your populace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Only this, too, I say at the same time: you would find over there something besides, something more, something which you do not bring out, which you cannot know and bring out, perhaps, without actually visiting the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but which you would recognize if you saw it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>My friend was a true prophet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>When I saw <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> I recognized that the general account which I had hazarded of them was, indeed, not erroneous, but that it required to have something added to supplement it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The new and modifying impressions brought by experience I shall communicate, as I did my original expectations, with all good faith, and as simply and plainly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Perhaps when I have yet again visited <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, have seen the great <rs>West</rs>, and have had a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reading of <persName n="Tocqueville,,M.,,,de" id="n0064.0003.00114.00366" reg="expanded:Tocqueville,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Tocqueville</surname></persName>'s classical work on Democracy, my mind may be enlarged and my present impressions still further modified by new ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>If so, I promise to make my confession duly; not indeed to make it, even then, in a book about <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, but to make it in a brief <quote>Last word</quote> on that great subject &mdash; a word, like its predecessors, of openhearted and free conversation with the readers of this review.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Let us treat as not more solid the assertion in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, that <quote>all men are created equal, and endowed <pb id="p.116" n="116"/>by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Let us concede that these natural rights are a figment; that chance and circumstance, as much as deliberate foresight and design, have brought the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> into their present condition; that, moreover, the <rs>British</rs> rule which they threw off was not the rule of oppressors and tyrants which declaimers suppose, and that the merit of the <rs>Americans</rs> was not that of oppressed men rising against tyrants, but rather of sensible young people getting rid of stupid and overweening guardians who misunderstood and mismanaged them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>All this let us concede, if we will; but in conceding it let us not lose sight of the really important point, which is this: that their institutions do in fact suit the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> so well, and that from this suitableness they do derive so much actual benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>As <num value="1">one</num> watches the play of their institutions, the image suggests itself to <num value="1">one</num>'s mind of a man in a suit of clothes which fits him to perfection, leaving all his movements unimpeded and easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>It is loose where it ought to be loose, and it sits close where its sitting close is an advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>The central government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> keeps in its own hands the functions which, if <pb id="p.117" n="117"/>the nation is to have real unity, ought to be kept there; those functions it takes to itself, and no others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The state governments and the municipal governments provide people with the fullest liberty of managing their own affairs, and afford, besides, a constant and invaluable school of practical experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>This wonderful suit of clothes, again (to recur to our image), is found also to adapt itself naturally to the wearer's growth, and to admit of all enlargements as they successively arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>I speak of the state of things since the suppression of slavery,--of the state of things which meets a spectator's eye at the present time in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>There are points in which the institutions of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> may call forth criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/><num value="1">One</num> observer may think that it would be well if the <rs>President</rs>'s term of office were longer, if his ministers sate in Congress, or must possess the confidence of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Another observer may say that the marriage laws for the whole nation ought to be fixed by Congress, and not to vary at the will of the legislatures of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>I myself was much struck with the inconvenience of not allowing a man to sit in Congress except for his own district; a man like <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0064.0003.00117.00370" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> was thus excluded, because <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> would not return him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>But all these are really questions of <hi rend="italics">machinery</hi> (to use my own term), and ought not so to engage our attention as to prevent our seeing that the capital fact as to the institutions of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is this: their suitableness to the <rs>American</rs> people, and their natural and easy working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>If we are not to be allowed to say, with <persName n="Beecher,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00118.00372" reg="mostcommon:Beecher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>, that this people has <quote>a genius for the organization of states,</quote> then at all events we must admit that in its own organization it has enjoyed the most signal good fortune.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Yes; what is called in the jargon of the publicists, the political problem and the social problem, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> does appear to me to have solved, or Fortune has solved it for them, with undeniable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Against invasion and conquest from without they are impregnably strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>As to domestic concerns, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to remember is, that the people over there is at bottom the same people as ourselves,--a people with a strong sense for conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>But there is said to be much corruption among their politicians, and in the public service, in municipal administration, and in the administration of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/><persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Lepel</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.119" n="119"/><persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00119.00373" reg="nearbymention:Griffin,Lepel,,,"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName> would lead us to think that the administration of justice, in particular, is so thoroughly corrupt, that a man with a lawsuit has only to provide his lawyer with the necessary funds for bribing the officials, and he can make sure of winning his suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The <rs>Americans</rs> themselves use such strong language in describing the corruption prevalent amongst them, that they cannot be surprised if strangers believe them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>For myself, I had heard and read so much to the discredit of American political life, how all the best men kept aloof from it, and those who gave themselves to it were unworthy, that I ended by supposing that the thing must actually be so, and the good <rs>Americans</rs> must be looked for elsewhere than in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Then I had the pleasure of dining with <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00119.00374" reg="mostcommon:Bancroft,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and however he may, in <persName n="Maine,Sir,Henry,,," id="n0064.0003.00119.00375" reg="default:Maine,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Maine</surname></persName>'s opinion, overlaud the pre-established harmony of American democracy, he had at any rate invited to meet me half a dozen politicians whom in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> we should pronounce to be members of Parliament of the highest class, in bearing, manners, tone of feeling, intelligence, information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>I discovered that in truth the practice, so common in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, of calling a politician <quote>a thief</quote> does not mean so very much more than is meant in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> when we <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>have heard <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Beaconsfield</foreName></persName> called <quote>a liar,</quote> and <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00120.00376" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>, <quote>a madman.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It means, that the speaker disagrees with the politician in question, and dislikes him. Not that I assent, on the other hand, to the thick-and-thin American patriots, who will tell you that there is no more corruption in the politics and administration of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than in those of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>I believe there <hi rend="italics">is</hi> more, and that the tone of both is lower there; and this from a cause on which I shall have to touch hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>But the corruption is exaggerated; it is not the wide and deep disease it is often represented; it is such that the good elements in the nation may, and I believe will, perfectly work it off; and even now the truth of what I have been saying as to the suitableness and successful working of American institutions is not really in the least affected by it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Furthermore, <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> is not in danger from revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Here, again, I do not mean that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are exempt from the operation of every <num value="1">one</num> of the causes &mdash; such a cause as the division between rich and poor, for instance &mdash; which may lead to revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>But I mean that comparatively with the old countries of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> they are free from the danger of revolution; and I believe that the good <pb id="p.121" n="121"/>elements in them will make a way for them to escape out of what they really have of this danger also, to escape in the future as well as now &mdash; the future for which some observers announce this danger as so certain and so formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Macaulay</foreName></persName> predicted that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must come in time to just the same state of things which we witness in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; that the cities would fill up and the lands become occupied, and then, he said, the division between rich and poor would establish itself on the same scale as with us, and be just as embarrassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>He forgot that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are without what certainly fixes and accentuates the division between rich and poor,--the distinction of classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Not only have they not the distinction between noble and bourgeois, betweeen aristocracy and middle class; they have not even the distinction between bourgeois and peasant or artisan, between middle and lower class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>They have nothing to create it and compel their recognition of it. Their domestic service is done for them by <persName n="Irish,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00121.00377" reg="mostcommon:Irish,nomatch:0"><surname>Irish</surname></persName>, Germans, Swedes, negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>Outside domestic service, within the range of conditions which an American may, in fact, be called upon to traverse, he passes easily from <num value="1">one</num> sort of occupation to another, from poverty to riches, and from riches <pb id="p.122" n="122"/>to poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of his possible occupations appears degrading to him or makes him lose caste; and poverty itself appears to him as inconvenient and disagreeable rather than as humiliating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>When the immigrant from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> strikes root in his new home, he becomes as the <rs>American</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>It may be said that the <rs>Americans</rs>, when they attained their independence, had not the elements for a division into classes, and that they deserve no praise for not having invented <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>But I am not now contending that they deserve praise for their institutions, I am saying how well their institutions work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Considering, indeed, how rife are distinctions of rank and class in the world, how prone men in general are to adopt them, how much the <rs>Americans</rs> themselves, beyond doubt, are capable of feeling their attraction, it shows, I think, at least strong good sense in the <rs>Americans</rs> to have forborne from all attempt to invent them at the outset, and to have escaped or resisted any fancy for inventing them since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>But evidently the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> constituted themselves, not amid the circumstances of a feudal age, but in a modern age; not under the conditions of an epoch favorable to subordination, but under those of an epoch of expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Their institutions <pb id="p.123" n="123"/>did but comply with the form and pressure of the circumstances and conditions then present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>A feudal age, an epoch of war, defence, and concentration, needs centres of power and property, and it reinforces property by joining distinctions of rank and class with it. Property becomes more honorable, more solid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>And in feudal ages this is well, for its changing hands easily would be a source of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>But in ages of expansion, where men are bent that every <num value="1">one</num> shall have his chance, the more readily property changes hands the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>The envy with which its holder is regarded diminishes, society is safer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>I think whatever may be said of the worship of the almighty dollar in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, it is indubitable that rich men are regarded there with less envy and hatred than rich men are in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>Why is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Because their condition is less fixed, because government and legislation do not take them more seriously than other people, make grandees of them, aid them to found families and endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>With us, the chief holders of property are grandees already, and every rich man aspires to become a grandee if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>And therefore an English country gentleman regards himself as part of the system of nature; government and legislation have invited him so <pb id="p.124" n="124"/>to do. If the price of wheat falls so low that his means of expenditure are greatly reduced, he tells you that if this lasts he cannot possibly go on as a country gentleman; and every wellbred person amongst us looks sympathizing and shocked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>An American would say, <quote>Why should he?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The conservative newspapers are fond of giving us, as an argument for the game laws, the plea that without them a country gentleman could not be induced to live on his estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>An American would say, <quote>What does it matter?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Perhaps to an English ear this will sound brutal; but the point is that the <rs>American</rs> does not take his rich man so seriously as we do ours, does not make him into a grandee; the thing, if proposed to him, would strike him as an absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>I suspect that <persName n="Winans,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00124.00378" reg="mostcommon:Winans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winans</surname></persName> himself, the <rs>American</rs> millionaire who adds deer-forest to deer-forest, and will not suffer a cottier to keep a pet lamb, regards his own performance as a colossal stroke of American humor, illustrating the absurdities of the <rs>British</rs> system of property and privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Ask <persName n="Winans,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00124.00379" reg="mostcommon:Winans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winans</surname></persName> if he would promote the introduction of the <rs>British</rs> game laws into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and he would tell you with a merry laugh that the idea is ridiculous, and that these <name>British</name> follies are for home consumption.

<p>The example of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> must not mislead us. There the institutions, an objector may say, are republican, and yet the division and hatred between rich and poor is intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>True; but in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, though the institutions may be republican, the ideas and morals are not republican.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>In <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> not only are the institutions republican, but the ideas and morals are pre; vailingly republican also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>They are those of a plain, decent middle class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>The ideal of those who are the public instructors of the people is the ideal of such a class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> the ideal of the mass of popular journalists and popular writers of fiction, who are now practically the public instructors there, is, if you could see their hearts, a Pompadour or <persName n="Barry,,du,,," id="n0064.0003.00125.00380" reg="mostcommon:Barry,du,,,:1"><foreName>du</foreName> <surname>Barry</surname></persName> <hi rend="italics">regime</hi>, with themselves for the part of Faublas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>With this ideal prevailing, this vision of the objects for which wealth is desirable, the possessors of wealth become hateful to the multitude which toils and endures, and society is undermined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the many inconveniences which the <rs>French</rs> have to suffer from that worship of the great goddess Lubricity to which they are at present vowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Wealth excites the most savage enmity there, because it is conceived as a means for gratifying appetites of the most selfish and vile kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>But in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, Faublas <pb id="p.126" n="126"/>is no more the ideal than <persName n="Coriolanus,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00126.00381" reg="mostcommon:Coriolanus,nomatch:0"><surname>Coriolanus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Wealth is no more conceived as the minister to the pleasures of a class of rakes, than as the minister to the magnificence of a class of nobles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>It is conceived as a thing which almost any American may attain, and which almost every American will use respectably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Its possession, therefore, does not inspire hatred, and so I return to the thesis with which I started &mdash; <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> is not in danger of revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>The division between rich and poor is alleged to us as a cause of revolution which presently, if not now, must operate there, as elsewhere; and yet we see that this cause has not there, in truth, the characters to which we are elsewhere accustomed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>A people homogeneous, a people which had to constitute itself in a modern age, an epoch of expansion, and which has given to itself institutions entirely fitted for such an age and epoch, and which suit it perfectly &mdash; a people not in danger of war from without, not in danger of revolution from within &mdash; such is the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The political and social problem, then, we must surely allow that they solve successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>There remains, I know, the human problem also; the solution of that too has to be considered; but I shall come to that <pb id="p.127" n="127"/>hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>My point at present is, that politically and socially the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are a community living in a natural condition, and conscious of living in a natural condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>And being in this healthy case, and having this healthy consciousness, the community there uses its understanding with the soundness of health; it in general sees its political and social concerns straight, and sees them clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>So that when <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> <placeName key="tgn,7007515" n="1.000 1232" reg="maine">Maine</placeName> and <persName n="Scherer,,M.,,," id="n0064.0003.00127.00382" reg="default:Scherer,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Scherer</surname></persName> tells us that democracy is <quote>merely a form of government,</quote> we may observe to them that it is in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> a form of government in which the community feels itself in a natural condition and at ease; in which, consequently, it sees things straight and sees them clear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>More than half <num value="1">one</num>'s interest in watching the <rs>English</rs> people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> comes, of course, from the bearing of what <num value="1">one</num> finds there upon things at home, amongst us <name>English</name> people ourselves in these islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>I have frankly recorded what struck me and came as most new to me in the condition of the <rs>English</rs> race in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I had said beforehand, indeed, that I supposed the <rs>American Philistine</rs> was a livelier sort of Philistine than ours, because he had not that pressure of the <name>Barbarians</name> to stunt and distort him which befalls <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>his <name>English</name> brother here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>But I did not foresee how far his superior liveliness and naturalness of condition, in the absence of that pressure, would carry the <rs>American Philistine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>I still use my old name <hi rend="italics">Philistine</hi>, because it does in fact seem to me as yet to suit the bulk of the community over there, as it suits the strong central body of the community here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>But in my mouth the name is hardly a reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>so clearly do I see the <rs>Philistine</rs>'s necessity, so willingly I own his merits, so much I find of him in myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>The American Philistine, however, is certainly far more different from his <name>English</name> brother than I had beforehand supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>And on that difference we English of the old country may with great profit turn our regards for a while, and I am now going to speak of it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Surely, if there is <num value="1">one</num> thing more than another which all the world is saying of our community at present, and of which the truth cannot well be disputed, it is this: that we act like people who do not think straight and see clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>I know that the <name>Liberal</name> newspapers used to be fond of saying that what characterized our middle class was its <quote>clear, manly intelligence, penetrating through sophisms, ignoring commonplaces, and giving to conventional illusions <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>their true value.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>And though often and often smitten on the cheek, just as <persName><foreName>Micaiah</foreName></persName> was, still I persevered; and at the <rs type="place">Royal</rs> Institution I said how we seemed to flounder and to beat the air, and at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> I singled out as our chief want the want of lucidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>But now everybody is really saying of us the same thing: that we fumble because we cannot make up our mind, and that we cannot make up our mind because we do not know what to be after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>If our foreign policy is not that of <quote>the <rs>British Philistine</rs>, with his likes and dislikes, his effusion and confusion, his hot and cold fits, his want of dignity and of the steadfastness which comes from dignity, his want of ideas, and of the steadfastness which comes from ideas,</quote> then all the world at the present time is, it must be owned, very much mistaken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>Let us not, therefore, speak of foreign affairs; <pb id="p.130" n="130"/>it is needless, because the thing I wish to show is so manifest there to everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>But we will consider matters at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Let us take the present state of the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Can anything be more confused, more unnatural?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>That assembly has got into a condition utterly embarrassed, and seems impotent to bring itself right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>The members of the <rs type="place">House</rs> themselves may find entertainment in the personal incidents which such a state of confusion is sure to bring forth abundantly, and excitement in the opportunities thus often afforded for the display of <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00130.00383" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>'s wonderful powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>But to any judicious Englishman outside the <rs type="place">House</rs> the spectacle is simply an afflicting and humiliating <num value="1">one</num>; the sense aroused by it is not a sense of delight at <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00130.00384" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>'s tireless powers, it is rather a sense of disgust at their having to be so exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>Every day the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> does not sit, judicious people feel relief; every day that it sits, they are oppressed with apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Instead of being an edifying influence, as such an assembly ought to be, the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> is at present an influence which does harm ; it sets an example which rebukes and corrects none of the nation's faults, but rather encourages them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>The best thing to be done at present, perhaps, <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>is to avert <num value="1">one</num>'s eye from the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> as much as possible; if <num value="1">one</num> keeps on constantly watching it welter in its baneful confusion, <num value="1">one</num> is likely to fall into the fulminating style of the wrathful Hebrew prophets, and to call it <quote>an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Well, then, our greatest institution, the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, we cannot say is at present working, like the <rs>American</rs> institutions, easily and successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>I will not ask if our institutions work easily and successfully in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>; to ask such a question would be too bitter, too cruel a mockery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>Anti-natural, anti-nature;</hi> that is the word which rises irresistibly in the mind as I survey <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00131.00385" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>Everything is unnatural there: the proceedings of the <rs>English</rs> who rule, the proceedings of the <name>Irish</name> who resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>But it is with the working of our <name>English</name> institutions there that I am now concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>It is unnatural that <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00131.00386" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName> should be governed by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Spencer</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Bannerman,Mister,Campbell,,," id="n0064.0003.00131.00387" reg="default:Bannerman,Campbell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Campbell</foreName> <surname>Bannerman</surname></persName>; as unnatural as for <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName> to be governed by <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> <pb id="p.132" n="132"/><placeName key="tgn,1028961" n="1.000 1" reg="cranbrook,kent,england,united kingdom,europe">Cranbrook</placeName> and <persName n="Heally,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0003.00132.00388" reg="mostcommon:Heally,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Heally</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Well, then, if there is such an evil necessity, it is unnatural that the <name>Irish</name> newspapers should be free to write as they write and the <name>Irish</name> members to speak as they speak,--free to inflame and further to exasperate a seditious people's mind, and to promote the continuance of the evil necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>A necessity for the <rs>Crimes Act</rs> is a necessity for absolute government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>By our patchwork proceedings we set up, indeed, a make-believe of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>'s being constitutionally governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>But it is not constitutionally governed; nobody supposes it to be constitutionally governed, except, perhaps, that born swallower of all clap-trap, the <rs>British Philistine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The <rs>Irish</rs> themselves, the all-important personages in this case, are not taken in; our make-believe does not produce in them the very least gratitude, the very least softening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>At the same time, it adds an hundredfold to the difficulties of an absolute government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>The working of our institutions being thus awry, is the working of our thoughts upon them more smooth and natural?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>I imagine to myself an American, his own institutions and his habits of thought being such as we have seen, listening <pb id="p.133" n="133"/>to us as we talk politics and discuss the strained state of things over there.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Everywhere we shall find in our thinking, a sort of warp inclining it aside of the real mark, and thus depriving it of value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>We think thus unaccountably because we are living in an unnatural and strained state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>We are like people whose vision is deranged by their looking through a turbid and distorting <pb id="p.136" n="136"/>atmosphere, or whose movements are warped by the cramping of some unnatural constraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Let us just ask ourselves, looking at the thing as people simply desirous of finding the truth, how men who saw and thought straight would proceed, how an American, for instance,--whose seeing and thinking has, I have said, if not in all matters, yet commonly in political and social concerns, this quality of straightness,--how an American would proceed in the <num value="3">three</num> confusions which I have given as instances of the many confusions now embarrassing us: the confusion of our foreign affairs, the confusion of the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, the confusion of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>And then, when we have discovered the kind of proceeding natural in these cases, let us ask ourselves, with the same sincerity, what is the cause of that warp of mind hindering most of us from seeing straight in them, and also where is our remedy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>The Angra Peque&ntilde;a business has lately called forth from all sides many and harsh animadversions upon <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName>, who is charged with the direction of our foreign affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>I shall not swell the chorus of complainers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Nothing has happened but what was to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Long ago I remarked that it is not <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName> himself who determines our <pb id="p.137" n="137"/>foreign policy and shapes the declarations of Government concerning it, but a power behind <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>He and his colleagues would call it the power of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>It is really the opinion of that great ruling class amongst us on which Liberal Governments have hitherto had to depend for support,--the <name>Philistines</name> or middle class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>It is not, I repeat, with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName> in his natural state and force that a foreign Government has to deal; it is with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName> waiting in devout expectation to see how the cat will jump,--and that cat the <rs>British Philistine</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>When <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Bismarck</foreName></persName> deals with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName>, he finds that he is not dealing mind to mind with an intelligent equal, but that he is dealing with a tumult of likes and dislikes, hopes and fears, stock-jobbing intrigues, missionary interests, quidnuncs, newspapers;--dealing, in short, with <hi rend="italics">ignorance</hi> behind his intelligent equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Yet ignorant as our Philistine middle class may be, its volitions on foreign affairs would have more intelligibility and consistency if uttered through a spokesman of their own class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Coming through a nobleman like <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName>, who has neither the thoughts, habits, nor ideals of the middle class, and yet wishes to act as proctor for it, they have every disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>He cannot even <pb id="p.138" n="138"/>do justice to the <name>Philistine</name> mind, such as it is, for which he is spokesman; he apprehends it uncertainly and expounds it ineffectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>And so with the house and lineage of Murdstone thundering at him (and these, again, through <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Derby</foreName></persName> as their interpreter) from the <name>Cape</name>, and the inexorable <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Bismarck</foreName></persName> thundering at him from <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, the thing naturally ends by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName> at last wringing his adroit hands and ejaculating disconsolately: <quote>It is a misunderstanding altogether!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>I said that a source of strength to <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, in political and social concerns, was the homogeneous character of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>An American statesman speaks with more effect the mind of his fellow-citizens from his being in sympathy with it, understanding and sharing it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Yet I think the true moral to be drawn is rather, perhaps, this: that our foreign policy would be improved if our whole society were homogeneous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>As to the confusion in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, what, apart from defective rules of procedure, are its causes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> and foremost, no doubt, the temper and action of the <name>Irish</name> members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>But putting this cause of confusion out of view for a moment, every <num value="1">one</num> can see that the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> is far too large, and that it undertakes a quantity of business which belongs more properly to local assemblies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>The confusion from these causes is <num value="1">one</num> which is constantly increasing, because, as the country becomes fuller and more awakened, business multiplies, and more and more members of the <rs type="place">House</rs> are inclined to take part in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>I have often said that we seem to me <pb id="p.140" n="140"/>to need at present, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <num value="3">three</num> things in especial: more equality, education for the middle classes, and a thorough municipal system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>Wholes neither too large nor too small, not necessarily of equal population by any means, but with characters rendering them in themselves fairly homogeneous and coherent, are the fit units for choosing these local assemblies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>No <num value="1">one</num> will suppose me guilty of the pedantry of here laying out definitive districts; I do but indicate such units as may enable the reader to conceive the kind of basis required for the local assemblies of which I am speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>The business of these districts would be more advantageously done in assemblies of the kind; they would form a useful school for the increasing number of aspirants to public life, and the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> would be relieved.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>The strain in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> would be relieved too, and by natural and safe means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>Provinces that are too large are broken up, as <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has been broken up. But the several States are nevertheless real and important wholes, each with its own legislature; and to each the control, within its own borders, of all except imperial concerns is freely committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> intervenes only to keep order in the last resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Let us suppose a similar plan applied in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>There are <num value="4">four</num> provinces there, forming <num value="4">four</num> natural wholes &mdash; or perhaps (if it should seem expedient to put <persName n="Munster,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00141.00401" reg="mostcommon:Munster,nomatch:0"><surname>Munster</surname></persName> and Connaught together) <pb id="p.142" n="142"/><num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>The Parliament of the empire would still be in <placeName reg="Greater London" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> would send members to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The <name>British</name> landlord would no longer determine the dealings with land in an Irish province, nor the <rs>British Protestant</rs> the dealings with church and education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Apart from imperial concerns, or from disorders such as to render military intervention necessary, the government in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> would leave <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> to manage itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>The local legislatures would regulate them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>But there is more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Everybody who watches the working of our institutions perceives what strain and friction is caused in it at present, by our having a Second Chamber composed almost entirely of great landowners, and representing the feelings and interests of the class of land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/><pb id="p.143" n="143"/>owners almost exclusively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, certainly, under the conditions of a modern age and our actual life, would ever think of devising such a Chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>But we will allow ourselves to do more than merely state this truism, we will allow ourselves to ask what sort of Second Chamber, people who thought straight and saw clear would, under the conditions of a modern age and of our actual life, naturally make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>And we find from the experience of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, that such provincial legislatures as we have just now seen to be the natural remedy for the confusion in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, the natural remedy for the confusion in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, have the further great merit, besides, of giving us the best basis possible for a modern Second Chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Senate" type="org">United States Senate</orgName> is perhaps, of all the institutions of that country, the most happily devised, the most successful in its working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>The legislature of each State in the <rs>Union</rs> elects <num value="2">two</num> senators to the <rs>Second Chamber</rs> of the <orgName n="National Congress" type="congress">national Congress</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>The senators are the <rs>Lords</rs> &mdash; if we like to keep, as it is surely best to keep, for designating the members of the <rs>Second Chamber</rs>, the title to which we have been for so many ages habituated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Each of the provincial legislatures of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> would elect members <pb id="p.144" n="144"/>to the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>The colonial legislatures also would elect members to it; and thus we should be complying in the most simple and yet the most signal way possible with the present desire of both this country and the colonies for a closer union together, for some representation of the colonies in the <orgName n="Imperial Parliament" type="parliament">Imperial Parliament</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Probably, it would be found expedient to transfer to the <rs>Second Chamber</rs> the representatives of the universities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>But no scheme for a Second Chamber will at the present day be found solid unless it stands on a genuine basis of election and representation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>All schemes for forming a Second Chamber through nomination, whether by the <name>Crown</name> or by any other voice, of picked noblemen, great officials, leading merchants and bankers, eminent men of letters and science, are fantastic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Probably, they would not give us by any means a good Second Chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>But, certainly, they would not satisfy the country or possess its confidence, and therefore they would be found futile and unworkable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>So we discover what would naturally appear the desirable way out of some of our worst confusions, to anybody who saw clear and thought straight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>But there is little likelihood, probably, of any such way being soon perceived and fold <pb id="p.145" n="145"/>lowed by our community here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>And why is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Because, as a community, we have so little lucidity, we so little see clear and think straight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>And why, again, is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>Because our community is so little homogeneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>The lower class has yet to show what it will do in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>Rising politicians are already beginning to flatter it with servile assiduity, but their praise is as yet premature; the lower class is too little known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>The upper class and the middle class we know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>They have each their own supposed interests, and these are very different from the true interests of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Our very classes make us dim-seeing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>In a modern time, we are living with a system of classes so intense, a society of such unnatural complication, that the whole action of our minds is hampered and falsened by it. I return to my old thesis: inequality is our bane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>The great impediments in our way of progress are aristocracy and Protestant dissent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>People think this is an epigram; alas, it is much rather a truism!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>An aristocratical society like ours is often said to be the society from which artists and men of letters have most to gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>But an institution is to be judged, not by what <num value="1">one</num> can oneself gain from it, but by the ideal which it sets up. An aristocracy &mdash; if I may once <pb id="p.146" n="146"/>more repeat words, which, however often repeated, have still a value, from their truth &mdash; aristocracy now sets up in our country a false ideal, which materializes our upper class, vulgarizes our middle class, brutalizes our lower class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>It misleads the young, makes the worldly more worldly, the limited more limited, the stationary more stationary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>Even to the imaginative, whom <persName n="Manners,Lord,John,,," id="n0064.0003.00146.00405" reg="default:Manners,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Manners</surname></persName> thinks its sure friend, it is more a hindrance than a help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/><persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00146.00406" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> says well: <quote>Whatever makes the past, the distant, or the future, predominate over the present, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>But what is a Duke of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> or an <rs type="role" reg="Earl">Earl</rs> of <persName n="Warwick,,,,," id="n0064.0003.00146.00407" reg="mostcommon:Warwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Warwick</surname></persName>, dressed in broad-cloth and tweed, and going about his business or pleasure in hansom cabs and railway carriages, like the rest of us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Imagination herself would entreat him to take himself out of the way, and to leave us to the <name>Norfolks</name> and Warwicks of history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>I say this without a particle of hatred, and with esteem, admiration, and affection for many individuals in the aristocratical class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>But the action of time and circumstance is fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>If <num value="1">one</num> asks oneself what is really to be desired, what is expedient, <num value="1">one</num> would go far beyond the substitution of an elected Second Chamber for <pb id="p.147" n="147"/>the present <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>All confiscation is to be reprobated, all deprivation (except in bad cases of abuse) of what is actually possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>But <num value="1">one</num> would wish, if <num value="1">one</num> set about wishing, for the extinction of title, after the death of the holder, and for the dispersion of property by a stringent law of bequest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Our society should be homogeneous, and only in this way can it become so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>But aristocracy is in little danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>If the <rs type="place">Church</rs> has the majority for her, she will of course stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>But in any case, this institution, with all its faults, has that merit which makes the great strength of institutions &mdash; it offers an ideal which is noble and attaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Equality is its profession, if not always its practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>It inspires wide and deep affection, and possesses, therefore, immense strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago I spoke in this Review<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/><hi rend="italics">The <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century</hi>, <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.</note> on the subject of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>; and after considering the institutions and the social condition of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I said that what, in the jargon of the present day, is called <quote>the political and social problem,</quote> does seem to be solved there with remarkable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>I pointed out the contrast which in this respect the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> offer to our own country,--a contrast, in several ways, much to their advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>But I added that the solution of the political and social problem, as it is called, ought not so to absorb us as to make us forget the human problem; and that it remained to ask how the human problem is solved in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>It happened that <persName n="Griffin,Sir,Lepel,,," id="n0064.0004.00157.00428" reg="default:Griffin,Lepel,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Lepel</foreName> <surname>Griffin</surname></persName>, a very acute and distinguished <name>Indian</name> official, had just then been travelling in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and had published his opinion, <pb id="p.158" n="158"/>from what he saw of the life there, that there is no country calling itself civilized where <num value="1">one</num> would not rather live than in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, except <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>Certainly then, I said, <num value="1">one</num> cannot rest satisfied, when <num value="1">one</num> finds such a judgment passed on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as this, with admiring their institutions and their solid social condition, their freedom and equality, their power, energy, and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/><num value="1">One</num> must, further, go on to examine what is done there towards solving the human problem, and must see what <persName n="Griffin,Sir,Lepel,,," id="n0064.0004.00158.00429" reg="default:Griffin,Lepel,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Lepel</foreName> <surname>Griffin</surname></persName>'s objection comes to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>And this examination I promised that I would <num value="1">one</num> day make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>However, it is so delicate a matter to discuss how a sensitive nation solves the human problem, that I found myself inclined to follow the example of the <name>Greek</name> moralist <persName n="Theophrastus,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00158.00430" reg="mostcommon:Theophrastus,nomatch:0"><surname>Theophrastus</surname></persName>, who waited, before composing his famous <hi rend="italics">characters</hi>, until he was <measure n="99years" type="date">ninety-nine years</measure> old. I thought I had perhaps better wait until I was about that age, before I discussed the success of the <rs>Americans</rs> in solving the human problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>But <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> is a great age; it is probable that I may never reach it, or even come near it. So I have determined, finally, to face the question without any such long delay, and thus I come to offer to the readers of this Review the remarks following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/><pb id="p.159" n="159"/>With the same frankness with which I discussed here the solution of the political and social problem by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, I shall discuss their success in solving the human problem.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>Perhaps it is not likely that any <num value="1">one</num> will now remember what I said <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago here about the success of the <rs>Americans</rs> in solving the political and social problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>I will sum it up in the briefest possible manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>I said that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had constituted themselves in a modern age; that their institutions complied well with the form and pressure of those circumstances and conditions which a modern age presents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>Quite apart from all question how much of the merit for this may be due to the wisdom and virtue of the <rs>American</rs> people, and how much to their good fortune, it is undeniable that their institutions do work well and happily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>The play of their institutions suggests, I said, the image of a man in a suit of clothes which fits him to perfection, leaving all his movements unimpeded and easy; a suit of clothes loose where it ought to be loose, and sitting close where its sitting close is an advantage; a suit of clothes able, moreover, to adapt itself naturally to the wearer's growth, and to admit of all enlargements as they successively arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/><pb id="p.160" n="160"/></p> 
<p>So much as to the solution, by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, of the political problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>As to the social problem, I observed that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were a community singularly free from the distinction of classes, singularly homogeneous; that the division between rich and poor was consequently less profound there than in countries where the distinction of classes accentuates that division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>I added that I believed there was exaggeration in the reports of their administrative and judicial corruption; and altogether, I concluded, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, politically and socially, are a country living prosperously in a natural modern condition, and conscious of living prosperously in such a condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>And being in this healthy case, and having this healthy consciousness, the community there uses its understanding with the soundness of health; it in general, as to its own political and social concerns, sees clear and thinks straight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Comparing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with ourselves, I said that while they are in this natural and healthy condition, we, on the contrary, are so little homogeneous, we are living with a system of classes so intense, with institutions and a society so little modern, so unnaturally complicated, that the whole action of our minds is hampered and falsened by it; we are in consequence wanting <pb id="p.161" n="161"/>in lucidity, we do not see clear or think straight, and the <rs>Americans</rs> have here much the advantage of us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Yet we find an acute and experienced Englishman saying that there is no country, calling itself civilized, where <num value="1">one</num> would not rather live than in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, except <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>The civilization of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must some-how, if an able man can think thus, have shortcomings, in spite of the country's success and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>What is civilization?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>It is the humanization of man in society, the satisfaction for him, in society, of the true law of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Man's study, says <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00161.00431" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName>, is to discover the right answer to the question <hi rend="italics">how to live</hi>? our aim, he says, is very and true life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>We are more or less civilized as we come more or less near to this aim, in that social state which the pursuit of our aim essentially demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>But several elements or powers, as I have often insisted, go to build up a complete human life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>There is the power of conduct, the power of intellect and knowledge, the power of beauty, the power of social life and manners; we have instincts responding to them all, requiring them all. And we are perfectly civilized only when all these instincts in our nature, all these elements in our civilization, have been adequately <pb id="p.162" n="162"/>recognized and satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>But of course this adequate recognition and satisfaction of all the elements in question is impossible; some of them are recognized more than others, some of them more in <num value="1">one</num> community, some in another; and the satisfactions found are more or less worthy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>And, meanwhile, people use the term <hi rend="italics">civilization</hi> in the loosest possible way, for the most part attaching to it, however, in their own mind some meaning connected with their own preferences and experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>The most common meaning thus attached to it is perhaps that of a satisfaction, not of all the main demands of human nature, but of the demand for the comforts and conveniences of life, and of this demand as made by the sort of person who uses the term.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>Now we should always attend to the common and prevalent use of an important term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Probably <persName n="Griffin,Sir,Lepel,,," id="n0064.0004.00162.00432" reg="default:Griffin,Lepel,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Lepel</foreName> <surname>Griffin</surname></persName> had this notion of the comforts and conveniences of life much in his thoughts when he reproached American civilization with its shortcomings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>For men of his kind, and for all that large number of men, so prominent in this country and who make their voice so much heard, men who have been at the public schools and universities, men of the <pb id="p.163" n="163"/>professional and official class, men who do the most part of our literature and our journalism, America is not a comfortable place of abode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>A man of this sort has in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> everything in his favor; society appears organized expressly for his advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>A Rothschild or a Vanderbilt can buy his way anywhere, and can have what comforts and luxuries he likes, whether in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> or in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>But it is in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> that an income of from <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="14">fourteen</num> or <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> a year does so much for its possessor, enables him to live with so many of the conveniences of far richer people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>For his benefit, his benefit above all, clubs are organized and hansom cabs ply; service is abundant, porters stand waiting at the railway stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>In <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> all luxuries are dear except oysters and ice; service is in general scarce and bad; a club is a most expensive luxury: the cab-rates are prohibitive &mdash; more than half of the people who in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would use cabs must in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> use the horsecars, the tram.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>The charges of tailors and mercers are about <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> higher than they are with us. I mention only a few striking points as to which there can be no dispute, and in which a man of <persName n="Griffin,Sir,Lepel,,," id="n0064.0004.00163.00433" reg="default:Griffin,Lepel,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Lepel</foreName> <surname>Griffin</surname></persName>'s class would feel the great difference between <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> and <pb id="p.164" n="164"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in the conveniences at his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>There are a <num value="100">hundred</num> other points <num value="1">one</num> might mention, where he would feel the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>When a man is passing judgment on a country's civilization, points of this kind crowd to his memory, and determine his sentence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>On the other hand, for that immense class of people, the great bulk of the community, the class of people whose income is less than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> a year, things in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> are favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>It is easier for them there than in the Old World to rise and to make their fortune; but I am not now speaking of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Even without making their fortune, even with their income below <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num> a year, things are favorable to them in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, society seems organized there for their benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>To begin with, the humbler kind of work is better paid in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> than with us; the higher kind, worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The official, for instance, gets less, his office-keeper gets more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>The public ways are abominably cut up by rails and blocked with horse-cars; but the inconvenience is for those who use private carriages and cabs, the convenience is for the bulk of the community who but for the horse-cars would have to walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>The ordinary railway cars are not delightful, but they are cheap, and they are better furnished <pb id="p.165" n="165"/>and in winter are warmer than <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class carriages in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Luxuries are, as I have said, very dear &mdash; above all, <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> luxuries; but a working-man's clothing is nearly as cheap as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and plain food is on the whole cheaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Even luxuries of a certain kind are within a laboring man's easy reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>I have mentioned ice; I will mention fruit also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>The abundance and cheapness of fruit is a great boon to people of small incomes in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Do not believe the <rs>Americans</rs> when they extol their peaches as equal to any in the world, or better than any in the world; they are not to be compared to peaches grown under glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Do not believe that the <rs>American Newtown</rs> pippins appear in the New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> fruit-shops as they appear in those of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> ; or that the <rs>Americans</rs> have any pear to give you like the <rs>Marie Louise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>But what laborer, or artisan, or small clerk, ever gets hot-house peaches, or <placeName reg="Newtown, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2540672">Newtown</placeName> pippins, or <persName n="Louise,,Marie,,," id="n0064.0004.00165.00434" reg="default:Louise,Marie,,,"><foreName>Marie</foreName> <surname>Louise</surname></persName> pears?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>Not such good pears, apples, and peaches as those, but pears, apples, and peaches by no means to be despised, such people and their families do in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> get in plenty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Well, now, what would a philosopher or a philanthropist say in this case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>which would he <pb id="p.166" n="166"/>say was the more civilized condition &mdash; that of the country where the balance of advantage, as to the comforts and conveniences of life, is greatly in favor of the people with incomes below <num value="300">three hundred</num> a year, or that of the country where it is greatly in favor of those with incomes above that sum?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>Many people will be ready to give an answer to that question without the smallest hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>They will say that they are, and that all of us ought to be, for the greatest happiness of the greatest number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>However, the question is not <num value="1">one</num> which I feel bound now to discuss and answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Of course, if happiness and civilization consists in being plentifully supplied with the comforts and conveniences of life, the question presents little difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>But I believe neither that happiness consists, merely or mainly, in being plentifully supplied with the comforts and conveniences of life, nor that civilization consists in being so supplied; therefore, I leave the question unanswered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>I prefer to seek for some other and better tests by which to try the civilization of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>I have often insisted on the need of more equality in our own country, and on the mischiefs caused by inequality over here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>In the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> there is not our intense <pb id="p.167" n="167"/>division of classes, our inequality; there is great equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>Let me mention <num value="2">two</num> points in the system of social life and manners over there in which this equality seems to me to have done good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a mere point of form, but it has its significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> knows it is the established habit with us in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, if we write to people supposed to belong to the class of gentlemen, of addressing them by the title of <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role2">Esquire</rs></hi>, while we keep Mr. for people not supposed to belong to that clsss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>If we think of it, could <num value="1">one</num> easily find a habit more ridiculous, more offensive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>The title of <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role2">Esquire</rs></hi>, like most of our titles, comes out of the great frippery shop of the <rs>Middle Age</rs>; it is alien to the sound taste and manner of antiquity, when men said <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Pericles,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00167.00435" reg="mostcommon:Pericles,nomatch:0"><surname>Pericles</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Camillus,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00167.00436" reg="mostcommon:Camillus,nomatch:0"><surname>Camillus</surname></persName></hi>. But unlike other titles, it is applied or withheld quite arbitrarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>Surely, where a man has no specific title proper to him, the <num value="1">one</num> plain title of Master or <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> is enough, and we need not be encumbered with a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> title of <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role2">Esquire</rs></hi>, now quite unmeaning, to draw an invidious and impossible line of distinction between those who are gentlemen and those who are not; as if we actually wished to provide a source of embarrassment for the sender of a letter, and of mortification for the receiver of it. <pb id="p.168" n="168"/></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>The other point goes deeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Much may be said against the voices and intonation of American women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>But almost every <num value="1">one</num> acknowledges that there is a charm in American women &mdash; a charm which you find in almost all of them, wherever you go. It is the charm of a natural manner, a manner not self-conscious, artificial and constrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>It may not be a beautiful manner always, but it is almost always a natural manner, a free and happy manner; and this gives pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Here we have, undoubtedly, a note of civilization, and an evidence, at the same time, of the good effect of equality upon social life and manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>I have often heard it observed that a perfectly natural manner is as rare among Englishwomen of the middle classes as it is general among American women of like condition with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>And so far as the observation is true, the reason of its truth no doubt is, that the <name>Englishwoman</name> is living in presence of <pb id="p.169" n="169"/>an upper class, as it is called &mdash; in presence, that is, of a class of women recognized as being the right thing in style and manner, and whom she imagines criticising <hi rend="italics">her</hi> style and manner, finding this or that to be amiss with it, this or that to be vulgar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>Hence, self-consciousness and constraint in her. The American woman lives in presence of no such class; there may be circles trying to pass themselves off as such a class, giving themselves airs as such, but they command no recognition, no authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>The American woman in general is perfectly unconcerned about their opinion, is herself, enjoys her existence, and has, consequently, a manner happy and natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>It is her great charm; and it is moreover, as I have said, a real note of civilization, and <num value="1">one</num> which has to be reckoned to the credit of American life, and of its equality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>But we must get nearer still to the heart of the question raised as to the character and worth of American civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>I have said how much the word civilization really means &mdash; the humanization of man in society; his making progress there towards his true and full humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>Partial and material achievement is always being put forward as civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>We hear a nation called highly civilized by reason of its industry, commerce, and wealth, or by reason of its liberty <pb id="p.170" n="170"/>or equality, or by reason of its numerous churches, schools, libraries, and newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>But there is something in human nature, some instinct of growth, some law of perfection, which rebels against this narrow account of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>And perhaps what human nature demands in civilization, over and above all those obvious things which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occur to our thoughts,--what human nature, I say, demands in civilization, if it is to stand as a high and satisfying civilization, is best described by the word <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi>. Here is the extraordinary charm of the old <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> civilization: that it is so <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi>. Do not tell me only, says human nature, of the magnitude of your industry and commerce; of the beneficence of your institutions, your freedom, your equality; of the great and growing number of your churches and schools, libraries and newpapers ; tell me also if your civilization &mdash; which is the grand name you give to all this development &mdash; tell me if your civilization is <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>In short, what <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00172.00447" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName> describes as <quote>was uns alle bandigt, <hi rend="italics">das Gemeine</hi>--that which holds us all in bondage, the common and ignoble,</quote> is, notwithstanding its admitted prevalence, contrary to a deepseated instinct of human nature, and repelled by it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>Now, the great sources of the <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi> are distinction and beauty: that which is elevated, <pb id="p.173" n="173"/>and that which is beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>Let us take the beautiful <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and consider how far it is present in American civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>Evidently, this is that civilization's weak side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>There is little to nourish and delight the sense of beauty there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>In the long-settled states east of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName> the landscape in general is not interesting, the climate harsh and in extremes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>The <rs>Americans</rs> are restless, eager to better themselves and to make fortunes; the inhabitant does not strike his roots lovingly down into the soil, as in rural <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>In the <rs type="place">valley of the Connecticut</rs> you will find farm after farm which the <rs>Yankee</rs> settler has abandoned in order to go West, leaving the farm to some new <name>Irish</name> immigrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>The charm of beauty which comes from ancientness and permanence of rural life the country could not yet have in a high degree, but it has it in an even less degree than might be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>Then the <rs>Americans</rs> come originally, for the most part, from that great class in <name>English</name> society amongst whom the sense for conduct and business is much more strongly developed than the sense for beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>If we in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were without the cathedrals, parish churches, and castles of the catholic and feudal age, and without the houses of the <name>Elizabethan</name> age, but had only the towns and buildings which the rise <pb id="p.174" n="174"/>of our middle class has created in the modern age, we should be in much the same case as the <rs>Americans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>We should be living with much the same absence of training for the sense of beauty through the eye, from the aspect of outward things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>The American cities have hardly anything to please a trained or a natural sense for beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>They have buildings which cost a great deal of money and produce a certain effect &mdash; buildings, shall I say, such as our <placeName reg="Midland Station">Midland Station</placeName> at St. Pancras; but nothing such as <placeName reg="Somerset House">Somerset House</placeName> or <placeName reg="Whitehall, London, Greater London" key="tgn,7011807">Whitehall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>In general, where the <rs>Americans</rs> succeed best in their architecture &mdash; in that art so indicative and educative of a people's sense for beauty &mdash; is in the fashion of their villa-cottages in wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>These are often original and at the same time very pleasing, but they are pretty and coquettish, not beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>Of the really beautiful in the other arts, and in literature, very little has been produced there as yet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>So much as to beauty, and as to the provision, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, for the sense of beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>As to distinction, and the interest which human <pb id="p.176" n="176"/>nature seeks from enjoying the effect made upon it by what is elevated, the case is much the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>There is very little to create such an effect, very much to thwart it. <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00176.00451" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName> says somewhere that <quote>the thrill of awe is the best thing humanity has</quote> :--<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>And so I say that, in America, he who craves for the <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi> in civilization, he who requires from what surrounds him satisfaction for his sense of beauty, his sense for elevation, will feel the sky over his head to be of brass and iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>The human problem, then, is as yet solved in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> most imperfectly; a great void exists in the civilization over there; a want of what is elevated and beautiful, of what is interesting.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>The want is graver because it is so little recognized by the mass of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00181.00470" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>; nay, so loudly denied by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>What you see are <hi rend="italics">beginnings</hi>, they are crude, they are too predominantly material, they omit much, leave much to be desired &mdash; but they could not have been otherwise, they have been inevitable, and we will rise above them</quote> ; if the <rs>Americans</rs> frankly said this, <num value="1">one</num> would have not a word to bring against it. <num value="1">One</num> would <hi rend="italics">then</hi> insist on no shortcoming, <num value="1">one</num> would accept their admission that the human problem is at present quite insufficiently solved by them, and would press the matter no further.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>But now the <rs>Americans</rs> seem, in certain matters, to have agreed, as a people, to deceive themselves, to persuade themselves that they <pb id="p.183" n="183"/>have what they have not, to cover the defects in their civilization by boasting, to fancy that they well and truly solve, not only the political and social problem, but the human problem too. <num value="1">One</num> would say that they do really hope to find in tall talk and inflated sentiment a substitute for that real sense of elevation which human nature, as I have said, instinctively craves &mdash; and a substitute which may do as well as the genuine article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>The worst of it is, that all this tall talk and self-glorification meets with hardly any rebuke from sane criticism over there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>I will mention, in regard to this, a thing which struck me a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>A Scotchman who has made a great fortune at <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburg</placeName>, a kind friend of mine, <num value="1">one</num> of the most hospitable and generous of men, <persName n="Carnegie,Mister,Andrew,,," id="n0064.0004.00185.00478" reg="default:Carnegie,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Carnegie</surname></persName>, published a year or <num value="2">two</num> ago a book called <quote><persName n="Democracy,,Triumphant,,," id="n0064.0004.00185.00479" reg="default:Democracy,Triumphant,,,"><foreName>Triumphant</foreName> <surname>Democracy</surname></persName>,</quote> a most splendid picture of American progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>The book is full of valuable information, but religious people thought that it insisted too much on mere material progress, and did not enough set forth <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>'s deficiencies and dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>And a friendly clergyman in <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 8170" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>, telling me how he regretted this, and how apt the <rs>Americans</rs> are to shut their eyes to their own dangers, put into my hands a volume written by a leading minister among the <name>Congregationalists</name>, a very prominent man, which he said supplied a good antidote to my friend <persName n="Carnegie,Mister,,,," id="n0064.0004.00185.00480" reg="nearbymention:Carnegie,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Carnegie</surname></persName>'s book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>On this I offer no criticism; what struck me, and that on which I wish to lay stress, is, the writer's entire failure to perceive that such self-glorification and self-deception as I have been mentioning is <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>'s dangers, or even that it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> self-deception at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>There are plenty of cultivated, judicious, delightful individuals there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>They are our hope and <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>'s hope; it is through their means that improvement must come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>They know perfectly well how false and hollow the boastful stuff talked is; but they let the storm of self-laudation rage, and say nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>For political opponents and their doings there are in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> hard words to be heard in abundance; for the real faults in American civilization, and for the foolish boasting which prolongs them, there is hardly a word of regret or blame, at least in public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>Even in private, many of the most cultivated <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0064.0004.00188.00483" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> shrink from the subject, are irritable and thin-skinned when it is canvassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>Public treatment of it, in a cool and sane spirit of criticism, there is none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>I vain I might plead that I had set a good example of frankness, in confessing over here, that, so far from solving our problems successfully, we in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> find ourselves with an upper class materialized, a middle class vulgarized, and a lower class brutalized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>But it seems that nothing will embolden an American critic to say firmly and aloud to his countrymen and to his newspapers, that in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> they do not solve the <pb id="p.189" n="189"/>human problem successfully, and that with their present methods they never can. Consequently, the masses of the <rs>American</rs> people do really come to believe all they hear about their finer nervous organization, and the rightness of the <rs>American</rs> accent, and the importance of American literature; that is to say, they see things not as they are, but as they would like them to be; they deceive themselves totally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>And by such self-deception they shut against themselves the door to improvement, and do their best to make the reign of <hi rend="italics">das Gemeine</hi> eternal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>In what concerns the solving of the political and social problem they see clear and think straight; in what concerns the higher civilization they live in a fools' paradise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>This it is which makes a famous <name>French</name> critic speak of <quote>the hard unintelligence of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></quote> --<hi rend="italics">Ia dure inintelligence des <persName n="Nord,,Americains,,,du" id="n0064.0004.00189.00484" reg="expanded:Nord,Americains,,,"><foreName>Americains</foreName> <nameLink>du</nameLink> <surname>Nord</surname></persName></hi>--of the <name>Very</name> people who in general pass for being specially intelligent; and so, within certain limits, they are. But they have been so plied with nonsense and boasting that outside those limits, and where it is a question of things in which their civilization is weak, they seem, very many of them, as if in such things they had no power of perception whatever, no idea of a proper scale, no sense of <pb id="p.190" n="190"/>the difference between good and bad. And at this rate they can never, after solving the political and social problem with success, go on to solve happily the human problem too, and thus at last to make their civilization full and interesting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>To sum up, then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>What really dissatisfies in American civilization is the want of the <hi rend="italics">interesting</hi>, a want due chiefly to the want of those <num value="2">two</num> great elements of the interesting, which are elevation and beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>And the want of these elements is increased and prolonged by the <rs>Americans</rs> being assured that they have them when they have them not. And it seems to me that what the <rs>Americans</rs> now most urgently require, is not so much a vast additional development of orthodox Protestantism, but rather a steady exhibition of cool and sane criticism by their men of light and leading over there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>And perhaps the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step of such men should be to insist on having for <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, and to create if need be, better newspapers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>To us, too, the future of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is of incalculable importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>We have a good deal to learn from them; we shall find in them, also, many things to beware of, many points in which it is to be hoped our <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>democracy may not be like theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>As our country becomes more democratic, the malady here may no longer be that we have an upper class materialized, a middle class vulgarized, and a lower class brutalized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>But the predominance of the common and ignoble, born of the predominance of the average man, is a malady too. That the common and ignoble is human nature's enemy, that, of true human nature, distinction and beauty are needs, that a civilization is insufficient where these needs are not satisfied, faulty where they are thwarted, is an instruction of which we, as well as the <rs>Americans</rs>, may greatly require to take fast hold, and not to let go. We may greatly require to keep, as if it were our life, the doctrine that we are failures after all, if we cannot eschew vain boasting and vain imaginations,--eschew what flatters in us the common and ignoble, and approve things that are truly excellent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>I have mentioned evangelical Protestantism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>There is a text which evangelical Protestantism &mdash; and, for that matter, Catholicism too &mdash; translates wrong, and takes in a sense too narrow.
