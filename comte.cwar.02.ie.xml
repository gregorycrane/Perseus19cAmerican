<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><emph>W</emph>E concluded the former volume with the narrative of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war, having brought down our review of the campaigns which were being prosecuted in the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> to within a few days of the anniversary of the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Those campaigns were but the prelude to the far more extensive operations and sanguinary conflicts which we are about to relate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>We shall begin by speaking of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, of which we have described the slow formation during the <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, and of its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movements in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Whilst the armies of the <rs>West</rs> have already overrun several States and fought great battles, the former has not yet had an opportunity to seek revenge from the conquerors of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In the last chapters of the preceding volume the reader has seen the difficulties of every kind which embarrassed its movements, prevented it from taking the field at an earlier day, and jeopardized the success of the plan of operations so happily conceived by its chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Nevertheless, after the unlooked &mdash; for evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, after the combats which kept in the valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> troops that would have been more useful elsewhere, after <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0001.00001.00003" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s interference in reducing his force to strengthen the <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> <orgName n="Garrison of Washington" type="garrison">garrison of Washington</orgName>, that army finally embarked at <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, in the last days of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, for the great expedition which was to transfer the seat of war to the vicinity of the enemy's capital; and <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0322.0001.00002.00004" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, when he landed upon the peninsula of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, notwithstanding all these drawbacks, had still a fine army under his command&mdash;a numerous army, however imprudently reduced, composed of ardent, vigorous, brave, and intelligent men, although without experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Recruited among all classes of society, the ranks of this army contained many men of military ability, as yet unknown to the world, and even to themselves, some of whom were about to be sacrificed before they could have a chance of asserting their full worth, whilst others were to be called to direct its long and painful labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Consequently, despite the mistakes of the government, this army could hope to run a brilliant career upon the ground, classic in the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, where it was at last to encounter the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lite</hi> of the slavery troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It was, in fact, in the peninsula where the soldiers of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <persName n="Rochambeau,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Rochambeau,nomatch:0"><surname>Rochambeau</surname></persName> completed the glorious work of American emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It was around <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, already made celebrated by the capitulation of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>, that the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> was about to fight its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battles; and if it may be permitted to an obscure member of that army to indulge here in a personal reflection, it was the remembrance of the victory achieved by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> conjointly upon this very soil which caused a throb in the heart of the exiles so generously received under the shadow of the flag of the young republic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Notwithstanding the historical associations which cluster around it, this locality was but little known; and in view of its peculiar configuration, we deem a detailed description necessary to a proper understanding of the operations we are about to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, situated at the extremity of the peninsula, lies <num value="115">one hundred and fifteen</num> kilometres from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, in a direct line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The route which the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> had to follow was all laid down; it stretched out, bounded on the south by the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>&mdash;which is a river (<hi rend="italics">fleuve</hi>) at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and a vast estuary at <persName n="News,,Newport,,," id="n0322.0001.00002.00006" reg="default:News,Newport,,,"><foreName>Newport</foreName> <surname>News</surname></persName>&mdash;and at the north, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by an arm of the sea called <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>, and then by the <rs>Pamunky</rs>, its principal tributary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The region lying between these water-courses may be <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> divided into <num value="2">two</num> parts: The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, by far the more important, forms a real peninsula between the salt tide-waters which ascend <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName> as far as <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and the <rs>James</rs> beyond <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This flat country, which is both sandy and marshy, intersected by countless bays, extremely wooded, poor, and thinly peopled, forms the peninsula of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, extending, between the <rs>Pamunky</rs> and the <rs>James</rs> proper, to a distance far above <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, very undulating, covered with magnificent forests, a little better cultivated than the former, and enlivened here and there by the residences of a few wealthy planters, is divided longitudinally by the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, a river rendered famous in the annals of American colonization by the romantic adventures of the traveller <rs>John Smith</rs> and the <rs>Indian</rs> maid <placeName reg="Pocahontas, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002287">Pocahontas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This water-course, of little importance from its ordinary volume of water, flows through wooded swamps, where impenetrable thickets alternate with groves of tall white oak, a tree admirably adapted for naval construction, the feet of which are buried in the ooze, while the trunks, as straight as the mast of a ship, rise to extraordinary heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>After a rain-storm, the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> not only overflows its wooded banks, but, spreading over the adjacent plains, forms a sheet of water which at times is a kilometre in width.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This, therefore, was a formidable obstacle in the way of military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The river runs parallel with the <rs>Pamunky</rs>, and cutting off a corner of the peninsula, empties into the estuary of the <rs>James</rs> at an equal distance from <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> and <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><placeName reg="The James">The James</placeName> on <num value="1">one</num> side, the <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName> and the <rs>Pamunky</rs> on the other, form <num value="2">two</num> magnificent lines of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The former is navigable as far as <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi> debarred the <rs>Federals</rs> from using it. The latter may be ascended as far as <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, a plantation which had formerly belonged to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and was now the property of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0322.0001.00003.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But at the entrance of <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> banks of this arm of the sea draw closer, forming a strait commanded by the guns of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and batteries erected opposite, at <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Hence the importance which has always attached to the little place of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, around which some slight undulations covered with rich turf still indicate the trace of the parallel thrown up by the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>American</rs> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> soldiers in <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The peninsula itself upon which <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> stands is narrowed by a swampy stream, <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName>, which, taking its rise at less than <num value="2">two</num> kilometres from the old bastions of this town, empties into the <rs>James</rs> perpendicularly to its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was here that nature had marked out for the <rs>Confederates</rs> their true line of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Having control of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName>, thanks to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>, owing to the batteries of <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName>, they could not be turned by the <rs>Federal</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <num value="2">two</num> rivers supplied them with provisions, instead of furnishing the means of attack to their adversaries, and so long as they preserved the line of <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName>, <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> could not be invested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>All these points, therefore, supported each other mutually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><num value="32">Thirty-two</num> kilometres separated <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>. <num value="16">Sixteen</num> kilometres farther, another contraction of the peninsula occurs, even narrower than that caused by <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName>, formed by <num value="2">two</num> streams called <placeName key="possibilities=12" n="1.000 10" reg=",">College Creek</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=11" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Queen's Creek</placeName>; <num value="1">one</num> running toward the <rs>James</rs>, the other toward <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Near this place stands the oldest university in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="William and Mary College" type="college">William and Mary College</orgName></hi>, founded during the reign of <persName><foreName>William</foreName> the <genName n="3">Third</genName></persName>, the spacious buildings of which, of red and gray brick, together with the court-yards and pavilions, remind <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>English</rs> edifices of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century, and have an air of antiquity seldom met with in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Around the university is grouped the pretty little town of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, the houses of which are surrounded by gardens and shaded by beautiful trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It was for a time the capital of the colony, when <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was richer and had a larger population than at the present day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Between <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> there is but a single line of railway, which, starting from the latter city, crosses the upper <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, then the <rs>Pamunky</rs> at <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, and terminates at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, where the latter river and the <rs>Mattapony</rs> both empty into the salt waters of <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Such was the new ground upon which the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> was about to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The transportation of this army was a difficult task, and was accomplished in a remarkable manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Consequently, the <rs>Richmond</rs> authorities, being fully convinced that he would not be able to maintain himself in that position, sent him a formal order to evacuate <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> and to abandon the entire peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>He refused to obey, and prepared to resist the enemy by placing his troops near the dams and among the few clearings adjacent to the stream, so as to deceive the <rs>Federals</rs> regarding his real strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The latter, being received by a well-sustained fire on their appearance, imagined themselves confronted by the skirmishers of an army concealed by the forest; and <persName n="Keyes,General,,,," id="n0322.0001.00007.00026" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Keyes</surname></persName>, commanding a column of more than <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> men which had thus unexpectedly encountered <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName>, did not consider himself strong enough to force a passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>A vigorous attack upon either of the dams, defended by insignificant works, would have had every chance of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The enemy could have been kept in suspense by several feints; there were men enough to attempt <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> principal attacks at once; it was easy, in short, to harass him in such a manner that his line of defence would inevitably have been pierced at the expiration of <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. In that case <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00008.00028" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> would have paid dear for his audacious resolution, the defenders of <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName> would have been scattered, and <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> invested on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>This place could have been masked until a vigorous bombardment should have compelled it to surrender, and by pressing <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00008.00029" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> close, the whole peninsula would have fallen into the possession of the <rs>Federals</rs> in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>This is what <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0322.0001.00008.00030" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> would not have failed to do if he had known the situation of his adversaries as their published reports have revealed it since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>But at that critical moment no information was received either from spies or from other sources to convey to him the faintest idea of their weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The line of defence they had adopted rendered it impossible for him to feel his way before assaulting them seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He could not compel them to show themselves except by crossing the narrow dams which intersected <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>To attempt this operation he had deemed it proper to wait for the arrival of <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00008.00031" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>'s <num value="3">three</num> divisions, which were to turn the enemy's line by the left flank of <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But on the very evening he reconnoitred the positions of his adversaries he was apprised of the deplorable decision by which the <rs>President</rs> withdrew from him this entire <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Finally, the naval force which had been relied upon to assist in the attack on the batteries of <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> declared that the necessity of keeping a watch over the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi> did not permit the detachment of a sufficient number of vessels for that service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>This <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> was, indeed, a succession of disappointments, and at a time when it was too late to draw back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It may be urged that this should have been considered as an additional reason for hastening operations, as the chance of obtaining an important success was well worth the risk that might be incurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The army needed a daring stroke (<hi rend="italics">coup d'audace</hi>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>But he would not compromise the young army entrusted to his care in an enterprise which he considered too hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Thinking that the national cause could endure delays and slow movements, but not such another disaster as that of <placeName key="tgn,7013988" n="1.000 22" reg="bull run, prince william, virginia">Bull Run</placeName>, he preferred to rely upon the superiority of his artillery in order to dislodge the enemy from his lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The Confederates, always under arms, exhausted by continnous service, did not understand what could delay an attack the issue of which they had such good cause to dread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In the mean time, behind the trees which limited their view, on the southern bank of the <placeName reg="Warwick, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,1131642">Warwick</placeName>, the whole Federal army was at work, erecting batteries and constructing long solid corduroy causeways through the marshy forests, to make a practicable passage for cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But the time which was thus spent was entirely to the advantage of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Some regiments, assembled in haste, had already been forwarded to <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, and <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00009.00036" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> had begun to receive his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reinforcements <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after the arrival of the <rs>Federals</rs> before that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>But instead of making the assault immediately after, the cannonade was prolonged for <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>, and thus <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00010.00042" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> was given ample time to prepare for defence wherever he might be menaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The Federals, crossing <placeName reg="Warwick Creek">Warwick Creek</placeName> with great boldness below the dam, took possession of the breastworks which commanded it, after an engagement in which they put to flight <num value="2">two</num> regiments of the enemy, the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC15">Fifteenth North Carolina</orgName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA16">Sixteenth Georgia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The most difficult part of the task was accomplished, a foothold having been obtained on the other side of the creek; all that remained to be done was to take advantage of the surprise of the enemy to push regiment after regiment as rapidly as possible across the ford, to pass beyond the breastworks, to take possession of the redoubt, and thus to pierce the enemy's line; but the generals of various grades who had organized this demonstration had failed to agree beforehand as to the importance it was to assume, and much precious time was lost.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Brigades, regiments, and even companies, were mixed up. The relative commands no longer existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>In their efforts to restore order among the troops the officers gathered around them, by their words and their example, men from the regiments, and marshalled them in haste and almost at random behind the breastworks erected a few days before near the camp occupied by <persName n="Kearny,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00064.00497" reg="mostcommon:Kearny,nomatch:0"><surname>Kearny</surname></persName>, <num value="2">two</num> kilometres <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> in the rear of <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> moment more, and <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0322.0001.00065.00498" reg="nearbymention:Smith,G.,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>, falling upon the extreme right of this weak line, would give the signal for a new attack, which would probably consummate the destruction of all the <rs>Federals</rs> south of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The warrior's instinct, which prompted him to push his divisions forward and mass them in the vicinity of the bridges when ordered to keep under arms, had enabled him to gain an hour, and that hour secured the safety of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>The new order directing him to cross the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> to participate in the battle reached him about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>The lower bridge had been carried away; the other was entirely submerged, while the unhewn timbers which constituted its flooring, being only held together by ropes, floated about amid the waters, whose impetuous current tossed them in their foam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>Speculation was soon brought into play to render these unfortunate measures still more odious; the laws of confiscation, to which we shall refer again, were applied in a manner unexampled in the history of this war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7381"/>This plan consisted, as we have already said, in taking possession of all the points along the coast which commanded the ports, bays and entrances of rivers in which Confederate or neutral vessels engaged in running the blockade might find shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7382"/>This substitution of land occupancy for a maritime blockade presented great advantages, especially at the approach of a season which would render a station on that inhospitable coast very dangerous, for vessels of indifferent quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7384"/>On <num value="1">one</num> hand, the small towns thus occupied found themselves separated from the rest of the continent, whence they had hitherto derived all their resources, and it became necessary to furnish not only the garrisons, but entire populations, with the supplies they needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7386"/>Vessels were detained at the points it was necessary to protect; obliged to land a portion of their crews, they had lost their efficacy for sea-combats, without supplying garrisons capable of resisting on land any serious effort on the part of the enemy, and they were surrounded by spies always ready to notify the latter as soon as an opportunity offered for attacking them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7387"/>The extent of the coast which the naval forces had undertaken to blockade had therefore the same inconveniences for them as the multitude of railways had for the land-armies, which were weakened to protect them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7388"/>These inconveniences were soon felt, and drew upon the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> a serious reverse, not in material results, but in the moral effect it produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7389"/>The Federals, indeed, in taking possession of the coast, not only proposed to themselves to complete the blockade of the <name>States</name> in rebellion against the <rs>Union</rs>, but they also sought to create centres of political resistance against the action of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> at all the points they occupied, and were especially in hopes of succeeding in their designs on the coast of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, where slavery had but recently been introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7390"/>Among the rough settlers who had come into that State from all parts of <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName>, there were many <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00633.06357" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName>, whose <pb id="p.634" n="634"/> number daily increased in consequence of the severity of the <rs>Confederate</rs> conscription law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7614"/>We must, however, comment upon it sufficiently to enable the reader to understand the war itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7615"/>It is time for us to do so; for we have avoided all allusion to the subject since the guns of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> controlled the action of parties.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7620"/>This military and financial legislation, therefore, formed the principal subject of their deliberations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7654"/>During the recess the legislative acts it had passed for the creation of volunteer armies were executed, enabling those armies, as we have shown elsewhere, to acquire the numerical strength, organization and necessary <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> for a great war. There were but <num value="2">two</num> measures relating to the formation of new corps, initiated by the <rs>President</rs> himself before the meeting of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7655"/>The object of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, under date of <dateStruct value="-09-17"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="17">17th</day></dateStruct>, was to assemble at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> a regiment of volunteers recruited in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7656"/>It was hoped thereby to enlist under the <rs>Federal</rs> flag those citizens who had remained loyal to the constitution, notwithstanding the secession of their State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7657"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort did not prove very successful, the number of Carolinians who sought refuge on the narrow downs of <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> being altogether insignificant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7658"/>On the <dateStruct value="-11-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00658.06453" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> likewise authorized the raising of Federal regiments in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7659"/>As that State was divided between the <num value="2">two</num> parties, and a large number of militia had already entered the service of the <rs>Union</rs>, several of these regiments were speedily formed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7660"/>In the mean while, the people of the <rs>North</rs> had eagerly responded to the call made upon them; and when Congress met, the government was able to announce that it had <num value="682971">six hundred and eighty-two thousand nine hundred and seventy-one</num> men in its service, <num value="640637">six hundred and forty thousand six hundred and thirty-seven</num> of whom were volunteers, <num value="20334">twenty thousand three hundred and thirty-four</num> <pb id="p.659" n="659"/> in the regular army and <num value="22000">twenty-two thousand</num> in the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7661"/>In order to avoid too great a multiplicity of regiments, and to secure recruiting for those already in existence, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> issued a circular, dated <dateStruct value="-12-3"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="3">3d</day></dateStruct>, informing the governors of States that, unless a special requisition was made by the <rs>Washington</rs> authorities to that effect, they were no longer authorized to form new regiments on the responsibility of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, and that all recruits enlisted were to be embodied in regiments already existing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7662"/>It is useless to add that these mandates could not be applied in regard to the local militia, who were placed under the exclusive authority of the governors, and liable at all times to be summoned by them in case of danger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7663"/>At its extra session Congress had adopted a rule to entertain only such pressing questions as had reference to the civil war. Military and financial measures, together with motions relating to slavery and the right of secession, had occupied all their time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7664"/>This was not the case at its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> session, which lasted <measure n="7.5months" type="date">seven months and a half</measure>, from the <dateStruct value="1861-12-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> to the <dateStruct value="1862-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7665"/>Still, these questions continued to occupy the foremost rank in the deliberations of Congress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7666"/>The republican element predominated more and more in both houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7667"/>This was in consequence of the defection of some members, who, following the example of <persName n="Breckenridge,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00659.06454" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>, had at last thrown off the mask, and the expulsion of others convicted of being in communication with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7668"/>Upon all questions involving the maintenance of the <rs>Union</rs> the <hi rend="italics">War Democrats</hi> sustained the government, which was only opposed by a few <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Democrats,,Peace,,," id="n0322.0007.00659.06455" reg="default:Democrats,Peace,,,"><foreName>Peace</foreName> <surname>Democrats</surname></persName></hi>. But whenever the subject of slavery was under consideration, or the daily conduct of the administration provoked discussion, Democrats of both shades united in stern opposition; and this the government had to expect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7669"/>The leaders of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, who blamed the <rs>President</rs> for showing too much favor to those opponents who supported his general policy, caused him, however, more embarrassment than this opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7670"/>The bargains which he had been obliged to make, and the proposals he had invited during the year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, in order to provide for the armament and equipment of the armies he was creating of all kinds of material, were the subject of sharp debates <pb id="p.660" n="660"/> in both houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7671"/>At times the public funds had been expended without discretion; at other times the governing rules of accountability had been violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7672"/>In these bargains and proposals some scandalous instances of corruption could be mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7673"/>Contractors, owing to protection too easily procured, had realized large fortunes at the expense of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7674"/>But it was difficult at first to place the responsibility of such acts where it belonged, and to distinguish the abuses that were inevitable under such circumstances and to which it was expedient to shut <num value="1">one</num>'s eyes, from those that were calculated to bring disgrace upon the administration or some of its agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7675"/>Personal influence controlled the action of Congressmen too much to admit of any impartial discussion of these questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7676"/>This led occasionally to the adoption of imprudent resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7677"/>Thus <persName n="Cameron,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00660.06456" reg="mostcommon:Cameron,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>, who was <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> up to <dateStruct value="-01-14"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="14">14th</day></dateStruct>, and had then been succeeded by <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00660.06457" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, was censured by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="-04-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> for having, during the early part of his administration, authorized military expenses outside of the department, without requiring the usual vouchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7678"/>To this resolution <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00660.06458" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> replied by a message, in which he stated that the departments were full of clerks who betrayed the government, that under such circumstances irregular means could alone accomplish the desired object, and emphatically asserted his responsibility for the acts of his agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7679"/>The matter was then dropped.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7680"/>We have already had occasion to speak of the committee appointed by both houses on the <dateStruct value="1861-12-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> to inquire into the conduct of the war. This committee, composed of senators and representatives, comprised some of the most prominent and radical members of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, who assumed this delicate mission at the time when the inaction of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00660.06459" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and the disaster of <placeName reg="Ball's Bluff">Ball's Bluff</placeName> entirely absorbed the popular mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7681"/>We shall meet them again from time to time in the course of our narrative, to the latest period of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7682"/>The laws passed during the extra session, however, seemed to be sufficient for the formation and support of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7683"/>The call for <num value="500003">five hundred thousand three</num>-years volunteers had given the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the armies of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, of the <rs>Tennessee</rs> and of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7684"/>Enlisted for a period which <pb id="p.661" n="661"/> seemed very long at that time, they had had ample time for thorough drilling before taking the field; but the terrible battles of the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> had speedily thinned off their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7685"/>It is true that the recruiting-office of every regiment was always open to those who were desirous of enlisting for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> and of joining the regiments already organized, but these means were not sufficient to maintain the army on a war-footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7686"/>During the month of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, after the <rs n="Battle of Fair Oaks" type="battle">battle of Fair Oaks</rs>, the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> and the campaign in the valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, when the <rs>Federal</rs> armies were decimated by sickness both before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and in the swampy posts of the <rs>West</rs>, this insufficiency had to be remedied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7687"/>This remedy could only be found in a new call for troops, and by offering greater inducements to volunteers than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7688"/>The governors of <num value="18">eighteen</num> States, conforming to the popular will, united in recommending this measure to the <rs>President</rs>; they offered him their co-operation in a letter dated <dateStruct value="1862-06-28"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the day when tidings were received of the commencement of the great struggle sustained by the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7689"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00661.06460" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> hastened to reply to these patriotic offers, stating that he should call upon them for <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> men, and Congress immediately passed a resolution legalizing this call, and enabling the government to fill up the weakened <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> of the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7690"/>This resolution became a law on the <dateStruct value="-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7691"/>It authorized the <rs>President</rs> on <num value="1">one</num> hand to levy new regiments of volunteers, not to exceed <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men, for <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> only, and on the other hand, to fill up the vacancies in the old regiments by means of enlistments for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. It was naturally hoped that by thus shortening the term of service men would be stimulated to enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7692"/>This law went much further; it established <num value="2">two</num> important principles, which, although a dead letter at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, found application at a later period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7693"/>In view of the possible invasion of some of the free States by the <rs>Southern</rs> armies, this law authorized the <rs>President</rs>, whenever he should deem proper, to call out the militia of those States, as he had a right to do in such contingency, and to muster it into service for a period not exceeding <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure>; and if voluntary enlistments should not suffice, it conferred upon him the power to complete the requisite number <pb id="p.662" n="662"/> by conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7694"/>The principle of compulsory service, which <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00662.06461" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had vainly asked to be enforced from the day he was placed in command at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, thus appeared for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time among legislative enactments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7695"/>The law of the <dateStruct value="-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> established another principle equally important as well as new, which, unlike the preceding <num value="1">one</num>, was destined to survive the circumstances which had given rise to its acceptance; this was the admission of colored men into the ranks of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7696"/>It was impossible to refuse the services of volunteers because they had <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> blood in their veins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7697"/>But the principle once admitted, there was no reason either for making any distinction between the free or enfranchised men of color, and the fugitive negroes, who came to beg of the national armies the privilege of purchasing their freedom by fighting in their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7698"/>The question regarding the application of this law was settled by the executive power in a proclamation issued on the <dateStruct value="-08-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>. <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00662.06462" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> ordered a levy of <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> militia for the service of the <rs>Union</rs>, for a term not to exceed <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure>. The contingent of each State was fixed by the <rs>President</rs>; and if not furnished before the <dateStruct value="-08-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, the deficit was to be filled by conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7699"/>The zeal of the local authorities, the ardor which caused volunteers to flock around the recruiting-offices, and the increase of bounties rendered the application of so novel a measure unnecessary for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7700"/>The same document announced that stringent regulations would be published by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, to secure the benefit of promotion in the new regiments to officers of the old regiments who had distinguished themselves during the war, and to exclude all those who should be deemed unworthy of wearing the epaulette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7701"/>It was, indeed, necessary to reward those who, for the last year, had gone through the trials of a severe campaign, and not to sacrifice their chances of promotion to intrigues and favoritism, which too frequently influenced the distribution of commissions in the creation of new regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7702"/>The governors of States were evidently impressed with this idea; for a large number of officers of inferior rank, who had signalized themselves on battle-fields, were appointed by them to higher positions in the regiments which were in process of formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7703"/><pb id="p.663" n="663"/></p> 
<p>Congress adjourned on the very day it voted the new call for <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7704"/>This session belongs to a period we have not yet touched upon; its most important work in a military point of view, the conscription law above alluded to, was enacted in the month of <dateStruct value="1863-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>; consequently, we shall not speak of it until after the great events which caused the <rs>American</rs> people to accept such a burden.</p>

It was, therefore, indispensable to resort once more to borrowing and the issue of paper money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7780"/>This time, however, it was found impossible to do this with that moderation which had marked the financial measures of the previous session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7781"/>A large loan could not fail to bear heavily upon the market; and in order to find subscribers, it was necessary at least to ensure the payment of interest by real and tangible guarantees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7782"/>The extravagant issue of treasury notes was equally, if not more, expensive in a national point of view, because, as they did not bear interest, their inevitable depreciation would involve a proportionate decrease of all the revenues of the <rs>State</rs>, and, moreover, it would have been equivalent to a tax affecting all transactions with foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7783"/>Certain favorable circumstances, indeed, seemed to conspire to avert a monetary crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7786"/>But the anticipation of an increase of paper money was sufficient to disturb the market, and to bring about the crisis, which was hastened by the consummation of the agreement entered into between the government and the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7787"/>The latter, in fact, having had to pour into the treasury the equivalent of the <num value="146000000">one hundred and forty-six millions</num> of bonds and scrip subscribed to by them within the space of <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, found themselves short of coin, and on the <dateStruct value="1861-12-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> suspended specie payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7788"/>In consequence of this, there was such a demand for the redemption of the <rs>Federal</rs> notes, that in spite of the law, the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">treasury department</orgName> was obliged to close its doors against those holding them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7789"/>The latter then took them to the banks, offering them as collaterals for specie they desired to borrow; but the deposits increased so rapidly, and the banks had already such an excess of government paper on hand, that on the <dateStruct value="-02-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> they refused to continue this kind of loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7790"/>This was another blow struck at the government notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7791"/>In order to counteract the effect of this blow and to facilitate the circulation of its own paper, the government became itself a lender, receiving its own notes as collaterals, and exchanging them for certificates of deposit, payable <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after date, with <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num> interest if the depositor was a private individual, and <num value="0.05">five per cent.</num> if a banking-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7792"/>So that the creditors, being paid in treasury notes, took them to the banks, which exchanged them for certificates, returning the same notes to the treasury, where they underwent again the same process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7793"/>These measures, however, were mere palliatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7794"/>The <orgName n="Chamber of Commerce" type="org">chambers of commerce</orgName> strenuously demanded the full value of the greenbacks; Congress had just empowered the government to issue <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> more of these treasury notes, to provide for its most immediate wants, which increased the amount in circulation to <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7797"/>The amount of the latter was fixed at <num value="90000000">ninety millions</num>, which, being added to the <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> already in circulation, made the sum total of Federal paper <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7798"/>The law made this paper a legal tender, receivable at par in payment of all debts, whether due to private individuals or to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7799"/>The law, however, made <num value="1">one</num> distinction between the <num value="2">two</num> issues.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7801"/>The loan fixed at <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> was issued in bonds bearing <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> interest, redeemable at par at the end of <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> or at the end of <num value="20">twenty</num>, at the option of the government, which took the name of <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num>-twenties</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7802"/>Their rates of interest varied considerably; it may be said, however, in a general way, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at that period borrowed at the rate of <num value="0.075">seven and a half per cent.</num> The pressing wants of the treasury obliged Congress on the <dateStruct value="1862-03-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> to double the amount of this temporary loan, and to quadruple it on the <dateStruct value="-07-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7803"/>This expedient not having, however, proved sufficient, the houses, <dateStruct value="-03-1"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct>, authorized the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> to satisfy the creditors of the government by means of <hi rend="italics">certificates of indebted</hi>-<pb id="p.675" n="675"/> <hi rend="italics">ness</hi>, payable at the end of <num value="1">one</num> year and bearing <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7827"/>It was not, therefore, from this source that the treasury could expect to obtain the funds for which it was calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7828"/>This capital could only become disposable by being withdrawn from the stocks (<hi rend="italics">valeurs mobilieres</hi>) in which it had been invested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7832"/>The most important question in internal politics, next to military and financial matters, is that of personal liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7834"/>This protective law is the true constitution of a free people&mdash;of those, at least, among whom, whatever their form of government, the most ardent passions acknowledge the supreme authority of the law, and where all citizens submit without murmuring to the institutions of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7835"/>But when these institutions are themselves in jeopardy, when the laws are trampled under foot by a fraction of citizens who resort to violence, the application of the habeas corpus becomes impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7839"/>The guarantees secured by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to all citizens could not be invoked in behalf of those who were openly conspiring against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7840"/></p> 
<p>The right to suspend, therefore, was unquestionable, but by whom should it be exercised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7878"/>Experience has taught us what little value there is in the oath which governments exact from public functionaries, whether elected or otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7880"/> 
<p>The author is here slightly wrong: an oath of allegiance is exacted from other government officers.&mdash;Ed.</p></note> But the oath of allegiance exacted from the political prisoners before they were set at liberty was rather a release on parole, because those prisoners, in virtue of their sympathies, belonged to a faction which was at open war with the government and claimed to be treated as a foreign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7881"/>It was natural, therefore, to exact from those who resided at the <rs>North</rs>, and whose sympathies for this hostile power were known, a pledge not to aid or favor it. Circumstances led the <rs>Federal</rs> government to extend the practice of exacting pledges, from the free States, where Southern accomplices were not numerous, to those sections of country where the <num value="2">two</num> parties faced each other, and finally to those rebel States they had conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7882"/>If on <num value="1">one</num> hand it was proper on the part of the government to impose this oath upon persons who continued to reside in the territories wrested from the rebellion, and whom it considered as belonging to the <rs>Union</rs>, on the other hand the inhabitants of those States who believed themselves to be legally separated from it justly claimed, according to their view of the matter, the treatment accorded <pb id="p.682" n="682"/> to non-combatants during international wars, and rejected the oath which implied a recognition of the sovereignty of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7883"/>The result of this system, therefore, was to divide the population of those countries into <num value="2">two</num> classes, the oath-takers and the oath-rejecters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7884"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, being exclusively favored at the expense of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, contained not only many sincere partisans of the <rs>Union</rs>, but also all the wavering or dissembling characters in the community, all those who desired to speculate on the war, and, above all, an incalculable number of spies belonging to every rank of society.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7885"/>The oath of allegiance, which was proper and easily applied in those States that had remained loyal to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, became, therefore, unjust and impolitic when the practice was extended to those which had been reconquered by the force of arms.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7887"/>Some were arrested for the same causes as their predecessors, others were simply the victims of their resistance to the militia conscription law.

These imprisonments, justified by the state of civil war, were generally of short duration; they did not the less constitute a violation of the habeas corpus; their legality, therefore, was frequently impugned before the courts of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7888"/>These tribunals, whilst recognizing the power of the <rs>President</rs> to order such arrests, refused to ratify those made by his subordinates, when they were not provided with a mandate bearing his signature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7889"/>This law was a barrier interposed against all abuse of power on the part of inferior functionaries; but, on the other hand, as it would have been annulling the right of the <rs>President</rs> to compel him to sign mandates which had to be sometimes executed at a distance of several <num value="100">hundred</num> leagues from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, it became necessary to determine to whom his power was to be delegated, and the limits within which this power was to be exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7935"/>This assembly, composed of men who did not deceive themselves regarding the difficulties of their task, unhesitatingly adopted a measure of a most radical character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7936"/>On the <dateStruct value="-04-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> it passed a law, which placed at the disposal of the government all the able-bodied population of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and which was called the conscription law, in the broadest application of that term, seeing that it provided not for a draft by lot, but for a levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7937"/>So severe a law could not fail to challenge sharp opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7938"/>The statesmen who had imposed it upon the people of the <rs>South</rs>, as a cruel consequence of the venture in which they had embarked their fellow-citizens, were exposed to the most severe attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7939"/>This law clashed, in fact, with all the ideas of liberty and independence conceived under the equitable and peaceful government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <persName n="Brown,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00687.06515" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, governor of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, placed himself at the head of this opposition, and was sustained by the legislature of his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7940"/>But the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> finally broke down all opposition; and the struggle being prolonged, the law of <dateStruct value="-04-16"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct> was gradually applied to those who by their age or other causes had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been exempted from its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7941"/>As this law was made the basis of all the military legislation of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it is necessary that we should explain its principal clauses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7942"/>It declared as soldiers all white men above the age of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and under <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure> residing within the limits of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, with certain exemptions, to be subsequently defined; their time of service was fixed at <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> or during the war, if the war should not last so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7943"/>This measure, comprising <num value="16">sixteen</num> classes, reached a large portion of the twelvemonth volunteers, whom it was important to keep in the field, and whose original term of service was thus forcibly prolonged by <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. Most of them having already accepted the offer <pb id="p.688" n="688"/> of a leave of absence in consideration of a re-enlistment, an ingenious expedient was devised to render this unfortunate promise null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7944"/>The bounty and leave of absence were ensured in principle to all the drafted volunteers; no distinction was made between them; but as the military necessities evidently did not admit of their being all allowed to receive this leave of absence, it was given to none of them, but all were granted, by way of compensation, a sum of money equivalent to their travelling expenses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7945"/>This law permitted the introduction of certain regulations and a method, in the formation and recruiting of regiments, yet unknown in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7946"/>The soldiers of a company were not allowed to re-enlist otherwise than in that company, the transfer from <num value="1">one</num> regiment to another by enrolment being a constant cause of frauds and mistakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7947"/>The regiments composed of twelvemonth volunteers, which came under the provisions of the new law, were allowed to preserve their organization instead of disbanding, but the officers who held their grades by election were subjected to a new ballot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7948"/>Companies or regiments which possessed their full complement, after deducting the men who had been drafted, were treated like volunteer corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7949"/>All the men comprised in the forced levy who, not having yet contracted any engagement, had not left their places of residence, were detailed to fill up the <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> of standing regiments, so as to maintain their normal strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7950"/>The government was authorized to send for them either by its own agents or those of the several States, and to enrol them without delay into the regiments that were most reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7951"/>Those whom it did not deem expedient to incorporate at once could be allowed to remain at their homes without pay and subject to a draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7952"/>No rule was laid down to govern its choice between the drafted men and the latter class, which constituted a reserve intended to supply the different depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7953"/>They did not, however, remain long in this category; for it was abolished on the <dateStruct value="1863-07-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> after the great battles of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, by a proclamation of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00688.06516" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, summoning them all to join the ranks of the army without exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7954"/>The law of <dateStruct value="-04-16"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct> finally conferred upon the government the requisite authority over the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the officers, by causing it to participate largely in the control of their appointments and <pb id="p.689" n="689"/> promotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7955"/>Whilst stipulating that the rank of second lieutenant should be made elective, and the other grades awarded according to seniority, it allowed the <rs>President</rs> to disregard this rule whenever he thought proper, and to make direct appointments of officers or non-commissioned officers to fill vacancies that might occur, without the intervention of the soldiers or of the governors of States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7956"/>The cases of exemption were regulated and often modified by subsequent legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7957"/>We give them as they were definitely settled at a later period, at the beginning of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the law of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> of this year being the only <num value="1">one</num> affording any precise information on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7958"/>Exemption from military service was granted to persons declared by the medical board unfit for such service, to ministers of religion, to the heads of charitable institutions, to the principal editors of newspapers .and to those in their employ whose services they represented under oath to be indispensable, to State printers, to <num value="1">one</num> person in every druggist establishment, to physicians over <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of age and with <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> practice, to directors and professors of colleges having more than <num value="30">thirty</num> pupils, and to the necessary <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of hospitals, railroads and post-offices; and lastly, to <num value="1">one</num> person on every farm employing more than <num value="15">fifteen</num> able-bodied slaves, and on which there was no white man already exempt from military services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7959"/>These farmers had to ransom themselves by payment of <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">one hundred</num> pounds</measure> of salt meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7960"/>The law of <dateStruct value="-04-16"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct> allowed, moreover, to all drafted men the privilege of providing a substitute in their places, the latter to be himself an exempt, reserving to the government the right of mustering them into service if this substitute failed to appear from any other cause than the casualties of war. This clause was abolished by the law of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, which mustered into the service all persons who had already procured substitutes.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7962"/>Finally, the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> and the legislatures of the different States passed several laws to facilitate and encourage the levying of volunteer corps composed of men freed from compulsory service; <pb id="p.690" n="690"/> but the classes from which these recruitments could be made were so restricted that the measures produced but insignificant results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7964"/>This law had, therefore, at the most critical moment, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, filled the <hi rend="italics">cadres</hi> of the armies of the rebellion, and enabled their generals to undertake the long and sanguinary campaigns we have related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7969"/>The troops enrolled at that period, in fact, formed the principal nucleus of their armies until the close of the war; the laws which were subsequently passed, extending still further <pb id="p.691" n="691"/> the liability to military service, were measures all the less efficacious because they were more severe, and the legislation of which we shall have to speak in the course of this history had scarcely any other object than to strike at those persons&mdash;a class which was daily on the increase&mdash;who, either as refractory citizens or deserters, sought to evade the rigors of the law of <dateStruct value="-09-27"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="27">27th</day></dateStruct>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7971"/>At the very outset of its organization the new Confederacy, in order to possess and demonstrate a capacity for action, had to create its finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7972"/>The chapter of expenses threatened to be heavy; it was necessary to provide for the support of volunteers who had been called to assist in the common defence, and who were passing from the service of the <name>States</name> to that of the central government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7973"/>The latter had indeed arrogated to itself the same prerogatives that the <rs>Federal</rs> power possessed under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, of which it pretended to be the legitimate successor; but the custom-houses, which formed almost the only source of revenue of the latter, could not, in consequence of the blockade, contribute any resources of importance to the <rs>Confederate</rs> exchequer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7974"/>To impose direct taxes upon the populations of the <num value="6">six</num> seceded States was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to be thought of, for they would probably not have accepted the burden without opposition, and the feeble ties that bound them together might have been broken; at all events, the prospect of these new taxes would in all likelihood have had the effect of stopping the other Southern States, which it was important to bring into the league.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7977"/>They were sold at par, but in small quantities, for on the <dateStruct value="1863-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> the treasury had not been able to dispose of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7978"/>Consequently, on the <dateStruct value="-04-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, new financial measures were adopted by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7979"/>The conflict had commenced; the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had received the addition of several new States, and its expenses had increased as rapidly as its resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7980"/>A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> loan was authorized for a similar sum of <measure n="15000000dollars" type="currency">fifteen million dollars</measure> in the form of treasury notes, bearing <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="31">thirty one</num>-hundredths per cent.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7982"/>The small success which had attended the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> issue of bonds, however, did not justify the placing of any reliance upon this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> issue as a means for defraying the immediate expenses of the war budget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7983"/>Recourse was had to a speedier means of relief, which, however, on that very account gradually involved the financial affairs of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in great difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7984"/>It was the same expedient resorted to by all States who have neither real resources nor solid credit to cover their expenses &mdash; the manufacture of treasury notes bearing no interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7985"/>This time, however, the amount issued was not extravagant, for it was limited to <num value="10000000">ten millions</num>, while the amount of circulating medium in the <rs>Southern States</rs> was estimated at no less than <num value="80000000">eighty millions</num>, counting both specie and private bank-notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7986"/>The provision making them a legal tender, however, disguised in the law under a form which did not in any way change its effects in a financial point of view, had from the very outset a tendency to depreciate the value of these notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7987"/>The measure was indispensable, for the precious metals were rapidly disappearing, and the <rs>Confederate</rs> treasury had neither the necessary bullion to sustain the currency of the paper nor the means of obtaining it. The resources upon which the government counted could not be realized until the raising of the blockade should enable it to sell its staple agricultural products, cotton, sugar and tobacco, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7988"/>Its notes were made redeemable at sight <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> after <q direct="unspecified">a treaty of peace</q> between the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7989"/>This was a very <pb id="p.693" n="693"/> uncertain date and a most precarious promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7990"/>It was, however, a precaution which enabled the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> to say after it had fallen that it did not break its engagements, since, in fact, the period for redeeming its paper never arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7991"/>Notwithstanding this reservation, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> issues went off without difficulty, for no <num value="1">one</num> doubted the perfect and speedy success of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7992"/>Congress, therefore, did not pause in the course it was pursuing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7993"/>But in order to consolidate its credit, it sought, in the first place, to turn to immediate account the vast quantities of cotton that were stowed away in the ports and warehouses of the <rs>South</rs>; it authorized the government to receive subscriptions under the name of <hi rend="italics">produce-loans</hi> or <hi rend="italics">call-loans</hi> from planters who had stores of cotton in their possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7994"/>These planters engaged to pay at a fixed date a specified sum, to be deducted from the eventual produce of the sale of their cotton, receiving government bonds in exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7995"/>These transactions created a paper which, having a tangible guarantee, was not so liable to depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7996"/>But the blockade, becoming daily more stringent, soon interposed a fatal obstacle in the way of this operation by rendering impossible the sales upon which the chances of the loan depended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7997"/>In consequence of numerous objections, the date of payment was deferred, and finally postponed, until after the raising of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7998"/>This modification greatly encouraged the lenders, the large proprietors, who were convinced that after peace the government would aid them to effect the sale of cotton upon which their subscription depended, and looked upon this very subscription as a sort of guarantee for the future; and during the single year of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> they pledged themselves to the nominal amount of <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num>, say about <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7999"/>But, on the other hand, the guarantees they gave, depending upon the raising of the blockade, were found to be as precarious as that of the notes, and their paper speedily underwent a similar depreciation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8000"/>This source of revenue soon proved insufficient, as the war budget was becoming heavier every day. A levy of volunteers, as we have seen, had been ordered, as a response to those which had taken place in the <rs>North</rs> after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>; it was likewise expedient to imitate the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> in a <pb id="p.694" n="694"/> financial point of view, and provide for the support of those volunteers by an additional issue of treasury notes, the negotiation of a new loan, and by taking the real sources of wealth in the country in order to secure the means for guaranteeing the interest on this loan, so as to be able to dispose of the shares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8001"/>Such was the triple object of the law proposed to Congress in the course of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and promulgated on the <dateStruct value="1861-08-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8002"/>This law authorized the issue of <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> in treasury notes bearing no interest, and redeemable only after the conclusion of peace; they did not vary from those already in circulation, except upon <num value="1">one</num> point, they were redeemable at <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after the close of the war, and not at <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>&mdash;an advantage which must have looked like cruel irony to those who after the war found themselves in possession of this worthless paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8003"/>The smallest denomination was of <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8004"/>The paper thus created was receivable in payment of all taxes, with the exception of the duties on the exportation of cotton.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8005"/>The new loan, like its predecessors, was issued in the form of government bonds bearing <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> interest, redeemable at the end of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> at the latest, the government being privileged to dispose of it as it thought proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8006"/>The law of <dateStruct value="-08-19"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="19">19th</day></dateStruct> fixed the total amount of bonds to be issued at a par value of <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num>; and as <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> had previously been voted, this loan added <num value="70000000">seventy millions</num> to the public debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8007"/>But the clause accounting the previous issues part of the <num value="100000000">one hundred million</num> loan authorized by this law was soon repealed, so as to enable the government to place new bonds in the market to an amount covering this entire sum. In order to facilitate the disposal of these bonds, it was stipulated, on <num value="1">one</num> hand, that they should be convertible at par into new treasury notes, and, on the other hand, that they should be received in payment of debts contracted by the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8008"/>The effect of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these <num value="2">two</num> clauses, called the <hi rend="italics">funding clause</hi>, was to withdraw from circulation a certain number of notes; it will be seen presently that the most arbitrary measures were resorted to in order to facilitate the operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8009"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was a disguised expedient <pb id="p.695" n="695"/> to obtain a forced loan by making the <rs>Government</rs> contractors bondholders in spite of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8010"/>The object of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName> of this law was to secure the payment of interest on this loan, amounting to <num value="40000000">forty millions</num>, by a final appeal to the real wealth of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8011"/>This section imposed a tax of onehalf per cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8013"/>Estates worth less than <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>, and the property of colleges, schools and religious institutions, were alone exempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8014"/>The difficulty in determining the correct valuation of property and in collecting this tax in a region of country so extensive, and so little inhabited as the <rs>Southern States</rs>, greatly diminished the payment of it. During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of the war, however, this section did not encounter the same opposition as at a later period, when it was aggravated by new stipulations, and it yielded a revenue which, if well administered, might have upheld the credit of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for a considerable length of time; in fact, as will be seen presently, the revenue secured by this tax was nearly <num value="17000000">seventeen millions</num> in <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure>, or about <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> during the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8015"/>Thanks to these resources and the hope of speedy peace, the finances of the <rs>South</rs> were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> well supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8016"/>In <dateStruct value="1861-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, the treasury notes were still at par.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8022"/>Instead of confining itself to receiving subscriptions depending upon the sale of this commodity, which were becoming more and more uncertain, the government was to purchase the whole supply and use it as a guarantee to negotiate loans in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8023"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> very properly rejected such a proposition, which began by obliging it to purchase what he could only pay for in paper, and, consequently, to increase still further the issue of treasury notes, whilst the credit which the ownership of cotton would have secured him in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> still depended upon the raising of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8024"/>The certainty that on the raising of this blockade the export duties on cotton would fill the coffers of the treasury, should be sufficient to secure subscriptions to his loan on the part of <name>English</name> speculators the following year; and he was satisfied, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later, by the monopoly of the cotton trade carried on by running the blockade.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8039"/>He was severely censured in regard to this matter, and Southern writers have accused him of having thereby contributed to the depreciation of Confederate paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8040"/>Nevertheless, as he himself observed, this paper could always be used in the purchase of government bonds; and as the interest on these bonds was also paid in paper, they were liable to experience precisely the same depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8041"/>In fact, the value of treasury notes redeemable at par after the war, and of government bonds whose interest was payable in paper, was regulated according to the chances, more or less promising, which the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had of triumphing, and both the bonds and notes had to suffer depreciation in proportion as the favorable termination of the struggle seemed more remote.</p>

This fact alone suffices to explain their depreciation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8051"/>Consequently, at the close of the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> the financial crisis was complete; it had produced its inevitable results&mdash;stock-jobbing, fraudulent transactions and illicit speculations, the responsibility of which people who have seen their financial prospects ruined by their own blunders in political economy invariably try to throw upon a few individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8052"/>While the <rs>Confederate</rs> paper was losing <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of its value, the bank-notes of private corporations attained a premium of <num value="0.9">ninety per cent.</num> over the government paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8053"/>The blockade had raised the price of all manufactured articles which the <rs>South</rs> could not produce, to an inordinate degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8055"/>The contracts for supplying the armies were awarded to government favorites, who, according to the testimony of Confederate writers, made them the object of reckless speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8056"/>Their rapidly-acquired fortunes, an insult to the prevailing distress, carried trouble and discouragement everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8057"/>In short, all the measures devised by Congress were powerless against the general laws of supply and demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8058"/>The enactments, prohibiting all commercial intercourse with the <rs>North</rs>, had no effect; it was carried on even in spite of the war. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pretext had been the purchase of medicines which the armies needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8059"/>This intercourse, thanks to the interested protection of high functionaries, soon extended, and the notes of the <rs>Federal</rs> government finally got into circulation, attaining a premium over the <rs>Confederate</rs> paper, which in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> was as high as <num value="4">four hundred per cent.</num> Finally, the laws directing the destruction of cotton, in danger of falling into the hands of the enemy, were no longer executed except by the agents of the executive power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8060"/>The bales containing this precious commodity were no longer seen blazing in every direction at the approach of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8061"/>Planters, instead of applying the torch themselves to perform the work of destruction, carefully concealed their cotton whenever the fortune of war proved adverse to the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers, and hastened to sell it to the speculators who followed in the track of the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8065"/>He recommended to Congress the adoption of decided measures in order, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, to diminish the number of treasury notes by obliging the public to convert those that had been issued, <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> <pb id="p.701" n="701"/> <num value="1">1</num>, <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, into government bonds, and, on the other hand, to secure the payment of these bonds by sufficient taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8066"/>As will be seen presently, this conversion of paper money into bonds was imposed upon the public by a regular certificate of bankruptcy; but the law which caused the treasury notes that had not been exchanged before a certain date to lose successively <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> onethird, and then <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num>, of their value, belongs to the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8067"/>Before Congress would have been able to devise new taxes, it became necessary to resort once more to loans and the issue of treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8069"/>So that, from the date of this law, the premium on gold was <num value="4">four hundred per cent.</num>, and in the month of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> of the same year <num value="9">nine hundred per cent.</num>, which was equivalent to absolute worthlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8071"/>This new law provided that on the <dateStruct value="1863-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> an estimate should be made of all the productions of the soil during the year that had just elapsed&mdash;grain, vegetables, sugar, tobacco, cotton, turpentine, colts, calves, lambs, all direct or indirect agricultural products, and generally the income of each person during the same period of time, Confederate funds alone excepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8072"/>The State appropriated to itself <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of all these products and revenues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8073"/>This tax, which seems to have been inspired by a recollection of the tithe and the enumerations of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, had scarcely gone into operation when it was pronounced to be insufficient, and <pb id="p.702" n="702"/> on the <dateStruct value="1863-04-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> Congress ordered the levy of an aggregation of taxes under a single head, which, had the law been strictly enforced, would have formed the most crushing fiscal system of which history makes mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8074"/>It was hoped thereby to obtain the means to pay the interest on the debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8075"/>But this system, which was the source of innumerable vexations, could not be seriously applied; and if the debt was never nominally in jeopardy, it is because the unlimited issue of paper money always made it feasible to pay the interest with this worthless currency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8076"/>The law of <dateStruct value="-04-24"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct> established&mdash;<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, an internal revenue tax of <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> upon all agricultural products wherever found, excepting only the quantity required for the support of each family; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, a tax of <num value="0.01">one per cent.</num> on all bank deposits, etc.; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, a license tax on all banks, hotels, and nearly all kinds of trade, from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>; <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, a deduction of <num value="0.01">one per cent.</num> on all salaries paid by the <rs>State</rs>; <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, a graduated tax upon incomes, the rates being <num value="0.05">five per cent.</num> upon incomes of from <num value="500">five hundred</num> to <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure>, and rising proportionally, with certain exemptions, to <num value="0.15">fifteen per cent.</num> upon those exceeding <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure>; <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, a deduction of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> on all dividends paid by stock companies; <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>, the same tax upon all profits realized on wholesale purchases of all articles necessary to life; <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, a similar tax, but in kind, with reservation for individual wants, on all agricultural products, vegetables or animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8077"/>This law, therefore, embraced tithes, licenses, taxes on the products of the soil, in whatever hands, the deduction on salaries, taxes or emoluments, and a <hi rend="italics">pro-rata</hi> tax on incomes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8078"/>Never, we believe, has a single law combined such an oppressive system in a few clauses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8079"/>We shall only mention in conclusion the small loan negotiated in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by the <rs>Confederate</rs> agents, which served to fit out the privateers, whose operations we shall yet have frequent occasions to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8080"/>This loan, the interest on which was payable in gold, deducted either from the profit of the sales of cotton brought by the blockade-runners, or from the capital advanced by subscribers, had in reality no other guarantee than the problematic recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and its value in the market followed the military fortunes of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8082"/>But in comparing them with those of the <rs>North</rs> we must take into account the constant variation of the monetary standard, which, by its continual depreciations, swelled in appearance all the figures contained in the <rs>Confederate</rs> budgets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8083"/>We shall merely endeavor to convey an idea of these variations, by quoting a single estimate of the expenses incurred during the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, about which the documentary evidence is particularly exact.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8086"/>To follow the same plan we have pursued above, we should close this sketch of the internal policy and condition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> with a few remarks upon the laws which struck at the personal liberty of citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8087"/>We have already seen how little this liberty was respected from the early stages of secession, when it seemed to interfere with the pretended unity of the secession movement; the guarantees laid down in the new Constitution were never of any effect against the authority of the government, which alleged the supreme necessities of war; and if Congress waited until <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> to suspend the habeas corpus, which was under its exclusive protection, its vote only served to legalize practices which had been adopted and followed long before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8118"/>We have shown in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume how slavery was the sole cause of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8126"/>We shall only allude to their names in this place in connection with the incidents of which they were the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8130"/>Although American commerce suffered severely by this violation of international law, the <rs>Americans</rs> could not make it a pretext for declaring war against their maritime rivals, at a juncture when they had so great an interest in concentrating all their forces for the purpose of crushing the <rs>Confederates</rs>, but the <rs>Washington</rs> cabinet determined at last to emphasize its protest by formally declaring that it would hold the <rs>English</rs> government responsible <pb id="p.708" n="708"/> for the consequences of that privateer's escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8134"/>It will be seen, when our narrative shall have brought us down to <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, what means it had to employ in order to accomplish this object.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8138"/>Whatever may have been the cause of quarrel which had armed <pb id="p.709" n="709"/> the <num value="2">two</num> combatants against each other, the usages of war, since these combatants belonged to civilized races, compelled them to be governed by certain laws, fixing the treatment to be accorded to prisoners, to the populations of the country which was the theatre of war, and to private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8139"/>Despite their animosity, the <rs>Americans</rs> of both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, so far as regards the manner in which they managed many of these questions, gave examples deserving to be pondered and imitated by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8140"/>This part of our inquiry will embrace exchanges, requisitions, reprisals and the confiscation laws.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8141"/>We have already stated that the <rs>Federals</rs>, in treating their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> military prisoners as enemies and not as culprits, had virtually recognized the belligerent rights of their adversaries from the outset of the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8142"/>The Confederates, on their part, having in their hands prisoners who had been surrendered by their generals even before the declaration of war, were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to inaugurate the system of release on parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8143"/>The regular troops whose misfortunes in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> we have mentioned were permitted to return to the <rs>North</rs> on condition of a personal pledge on the part of every officer and soldier not to bear arms against the <rs>Confederates</rs> before having been exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8144"/>The <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs> and the capitulation of <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, having increased the number of Federal prisoners, the government of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, without formally entering into the question of exchanges, gladly accepted <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> the principle of release on parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8145"/>It had already endorsed the stipulations entered into in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>; it sanctioned the conditions imposed by <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00709.06544" reg="mostcommon:Price,Sterling,,,:3"><surname>Price</surname></persName> upon the garrison of <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName> by retaining <persName n="Mulligan,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00709.06545" reg="mostcommon:Mulligan,nomatch:0"><surname>Mulligan</surname></persName>'s soldiers in camp, where they waited to be exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8146"/>This humane system, however, soon gave rise to serious abuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8147"/>As has been shown in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00709.06546" reg="mostcommon:Price,Sterling,,,:3"><surname>Price</surname></persName> had kept as prisoners of war all the officers he had found in <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, and had only released the soldiers on parole, because he could neither keep them in the place nor take them along with him. If they had refused to take the pledge, he would have been obliged to let them go unconditionally free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8148"/>The commanders of regiments, detachments or bands on both sides soon arrogated to themselves the right of exacting this pledge, not only from able-bodied prisoners who fell into their <pb id="p.710" n="710"/> hands, but even from the wounded and the sick whom they could not remove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8149"/>Sometimes a dozen mounted men might be seen to fall suddenly upon a depot, to enter a hospital and compel hundreds of invalids to sign the parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8150"/>On the other hand, the certainty of being released as soon as captured, the thought of escaping from danger by surrendering to the enemy, and by means of a simple signature of being sent to some distant camp far from the theatre of war, enervated many soldiers whose courage would otherwise have been stimulated by the prospect of a long and cruel captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8151"/>In the beginning of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> effected a change in the proportion of prisoners in favor of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8152"/>The <num value="14000">fourteen thousand</num> men included in the capitulation were retained by the <rs>Federals</rs>, who, having abundant means of transportation, desired to send them to the <rs>Western States</rs>, where their presence might afford evidence that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00710.06547" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s victory had not been exaggerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8153"/>The government of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was, moreover, anxious to avail itself of the advantage it then possessed to regulate the conditions of exchanges in a precise manner, so as to obtain the release of all the officers held captives in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8154"/>The Confederates did indeed have a certain number of Federals as hostages at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, many of them of high rank, who were held responsible for the treatment accorded in the <rs>North</rs> both to pirates and partisans, and sometimes even to conspirators or assassins who under some plea or other claimed to be considered as political prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8155"/>They refused to dispossess themselves of these hostages by exchanging them for the <name>Donelson</name> prisoners, and shut them up in an old tobacco warehouse, which subsequently became notorious under the name of <placeName reg="Libby Prison">Libby Prison</placeName>, where these officers were most cruelly treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8156"/>These unnecessary rigors were only a prelude to the atrocities which at a later period digraced the <rs>Confederates</rs> when the latter became exasperated by the abolition of slavery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8157"/>The system of exchanges and of release on parole having thus been suspended, <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00710.06548" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s campaign in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> greatly increased the number of prisoners on both sides, and this vast number of unserviceable men became a source of great embarrassment to the <num value="2">two</num> governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8158"/>On the other hand, the care of the wounded and the various incidents of the war had rendered the <pb id="p.711" n="711"/> intercourse between the commanders of the <num value="2">two</num> armies under flags of truce very frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8159"/>In these interviews the question of the exchange of prisoners was always made the subject of discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8160"/>Finally, after the great conflicts of which the borders of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> were the theatre, the <rs>Federal</rs> government determined to discard all the scruples which had hitherto prevented it from treating officially with the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and agreed to appoint a commissioner empowered to conclude a convention or <hi rend="italics">cartel</hi> of exchange with any representative of the enemy's army designated for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8161"/>The Federal <persName n="Dix,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00711.06549" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">general</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName> and the <rs>Confederate D.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8162"/>This convention, which was prompted by the strongest feelings of humanity, mitigated for some time the horrors of war; but it was unfortunately of short duration, and could not withstand the violence of passion, which was increasing as the struggle continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8163"/>We will indicate in a few words the object aimed at by this convention, and the principles it embodied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8164"/>A list of equivalent grades was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drawn up, representing the value of each grade in the exchanges, from the non-commissioned officer, counting for <num value="2">two</num> privates, to the general, who was estimated as equal to <num value="46">forty-six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8165"/>Federal or <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> ranks being alone recognized, to the exclusion of the local militia, it was agreed that the exchanges should only apply to military men, in order to avoid mixing up political questions with this operation, and to prevent belligerents from appropriating to themselves the money of combatants left on the field of battle in the hands of the enemy; the militia and civic persons could, however, be exchanged for each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8166"/>All prisoners taken on either side were to be released on parole within <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after their capture, and taken to the points specified by the convention for their exchange, at the expense of the power detaining them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8167"/>These prisoners, having thus been mutually surrendered, were considered as exchanged &mdash; that is to say, free from all obligations-excepting those who were found to be in excess of the number possessed by the other party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8168"/>Each of the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents, in surrendering a certain number of unpledged <pb id="p.712" n="712"/> captives, was authorized to release from their promise an equal number of its own soldiers who had been set free on parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8169"/>It was stipulated that both parties should keep a double register of the prisoners that each surrendered to the other, as well as of those who were released from their parole, with the understanding that the adversary was always to be furnished with a list of the latter by the party thus receiving back combatants into the ranks of its armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8170"/>This double register was a necessary safeguard to prove the violations of parole, if any took place, and to establish by exact figures which of the <num value="2">two</num> parties had a surplus over the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8171"/>They mutually pledged each other to continue the system of immediate releases on parole and regular exchanges, according to the table of equivalents, whatever might be the result of the comparison of the <num value="2">two</num> registers, by detaining no soldier belonging to the enemy beyond the time absolutely necessary for his return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8172"/>It was expressly stipulated that the obligation imposed by the parole should inhibit all manner of military service in the interior, no matter under what denomination, and that the prisoners surrendered on those conditions should not be released from this obligation, until the day when their equivalent was actually delivered into the hands of the enemy, according to the forms agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8173"/>Additional articles provided that in the armies the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commanders-in-chief</rs> should alone have the right of treating directly between themselves relative to exchanges and the release of prisoners on parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8174"/>Outside of their sphere, the task of regulating these questions was left to <num value="2">two</num> commissioners or special agents, representing the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents, and the delivery of the men on each side was to take place exclusively at <num value="1">one</num> of the following places, the <rs type="place">Aikin farm</rs>, on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River, in Virginia</placeName>, and the city of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8175"/>It was agreed upon that the exchange should not be interrupted, even if the interpretation of the cartel should give rise to discussions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8176"/>The <num value="2">two</num> generals who placed their names at the bottom of the only formal convention concluded between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> in the course of this war relied, as we see, upon their mutual good faith to secure to every prisoner the benefit of an immediate release, and to exchange the sufferings of a long captivity for a <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> trip, balancing the amount of debit and credit between <pb id="p.713" n="713"/> the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8177"/>But at the same time, they restricted the use of paroles, recognizing only those which had been given in due form, and binding the victor not to release his prisoners, until the fact of their <hi rend="italics">bonafide</hi> capture had been verified by some days' detention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8178"/>They thus put an end to the abuses we have noticed above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8179"/>Although their work was to be abruptly brought to a close before the end of the conflict, by the refusal of the <rs>South</rs> to treat colored soldiers as prisoners of war, it will stand as a useful example to follow, for those who may seek to mitigate the sufferings of future wars.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8180"/>The cartel of the <dateStruct value="-07-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> had scarcely been signed when the difficulties contemplated in <num value="1">one</num> of its last clauses began to develop themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8181"/>But these difficulties, arising from the treatment of citizens and partisans more or less regularly enrolled in the service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, occurred, as we have before observed, prior to the conferences held between the <num value="2">two</num> negotiators at <placeName reg="Haxall's Landing">Haxall's Landing</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8182"/>The use of requisitions for supplies in kind is a necessity justified by the custom of war. All armies in the field are obliged to resort to them in order to secure provisions and means of transportation, in a friendly as well as in a hostile country, and the inhabitants who are affected have no right to complain when they receive vouchers signed by officers regularly authorized to issue them in exchange for the articles required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8183"/>The proffer of these vouchers constitutes the distinction between regular requisitions and plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8184"/>The American armies never exacted war contributions of the towns they occupied; they very seldom plundered; and as they derived nearly all their resources from their depots situated in the interior, they only resorted to requisitions with extreme moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8185"/>It has even been made a matter of reproach against <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00713.06550" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> that he carried to excess his protection of private property in the country occupied by his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8186"/>During all his campaigns he watched with particular care over the safety of farms, cattle and lands under cultivation, which lay among his camps or along the roads followed by his soldiers; and the author remembers even to have seen, at the very height of the <rs n="Battle of Frazier Farm" type="battle">battle of Frazier's Farm</rs>, a sentinel stationed at the foot of a cherry tree loaded with fruit, which the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers, thirsty after a long <pb id="p.714" n="714"/> march, were preparing to demolish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8187"/>But in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, where the war assumed quite a different character, requisitions on both sides were merely organized depredations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8188"/>When <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00714.06551" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>, who had begun the war in that State, was summoned to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, he sought to introduce some of the practices he had followed among the combative communities west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8189"/>In this, however, he only followed the example of <persName n="Milroy,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00714.06552" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Milroy</surname></persName>, who, since he had exercised a command independent of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00714.06553" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in the valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, had sought to repair his errors, and compensate for his reverses, by resorting to every kind of arrogance and violence against the farmers of that rich country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8190"/>This abuse of the right of requisition having given rise to numerous complaints, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> issued an order, dated <dateStruct value="1862-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="22">22</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the very day of the signing of the cartel of exchanges, regulating its application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8191"/>This order directed that in the <num value="9">nine</num> States then considered in rebellion the military authorities should proceed to seize all that was necessary to supply the wants of the war, out of private property, prohibiting at the same time any destruction of property not justified by those wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8192"/>It authorized, likewise, the employment of negroes, found upon plantations, for all the work required by the army or navy, by means of proper compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8193"/>It finally directed that all requisitions for slaves or articles of any kind should be made in writing, so as to entitle the owners of such property to indemnity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8194"/>Nothing could be more equitable, but the seizure of slaves and their employment in labors, for which they themselves received the wages, was looked upon by Southern planters as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step toward emancipation, and the order of the <rs>Federal Secretary</rs> was made the subject of a violent protest on the part of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00714.06554" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8195"/>The treatment of citizens and partisans who were fighting on their own account gave rise to difficulties of a much more serious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8196"/>In a civil war, where certain States found themselves divided between the adherents of the <num value="2">two</num> causes, it was not an easy matter to draw a distinct line separating the assassin from the insurgent and the latter from the belligerent, the conspirator from the citizen armed in defence of his own opinions, and the latter from the regular soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8197"/>In the <rs>Northern States</rs> any man who should have fired upon a Federal uniform or raised the <pb id="p.715" n="715"/> standard of secession could only have been treated as an ordinary criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8198"/>More to the south, in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, he would shelter himself behind the name of partisan or militiaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8199"/>Farther yet, in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> or in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, he was a regularly recognized enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8200"/>The Federals always treated those who fell into their hands on the field of battle, having a commission from the hostile government, as prisoners of war. Thus, for instance, after the capitulation of <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00715.06555" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00715.06556" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, who had organized the secession troops in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, having been claimed by the <rs>Union</rs> authorities of that State for the purpose of being tried on a criminal charge, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00715.06557" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> set aside the demand, and took the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity to exchange him. The <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> government had the same consideration for the partisans who fought openly in uniform and respected the rules of war. But the safety of its own soldiers, and that of the inhabitants who sought the protection of the <rs>Federal</rs> flag, did not permit crimes committed against all the usages of civilized nations to go unpunished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8201"/>Lawless men in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> took advantage of the state of war to indulge in acts of violence of every description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8202"/>Some of them were made to suffer capital punishment, justly due to their excesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8203"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName> protested, assuming to throw the shield of its protection over these wretches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8204"/>Wherever the <rs>Federal</rs> armies passed, a certain number of the inhabitants, after professing to be peaceful citizens, would go into ambush in the woods to assassinate stragglers, and even the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8205"/>Those who were thus taken with arms in hand and without uniform were all shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8206"/>This was only justice; and they must have known to what they exposed themselves by playing such a double game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8207"/>But the <name>Unionists</name>, exasperated by these assassinations, sometimes exceeded all bounds, seeking, as we have too often seen in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> wars, to make the inoffensive population responsible for the acts of partisans who were found in their neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8208"/>This odious system was especially applied by <persName n="Steinwehr,General,,,,Von" id="n0322.0007.00715.06558" reg="nearbymention:Steinwehr,Von,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <nameLink>Von</nameLink> <surname>Steinwehr</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, who made it a practice to seize hostages in every village near which his troops had met with any partisans, threatening to shoot them if the <rs>Confederates</rs> continued that kind of warfare against him. His chief, <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00715.06559" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>, having committed the grave error of sanctioning such proceedings, the <pb id="p.716" n="716"/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> government was greatly enraged, and on the <dateStruct value="1862-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00716.06560" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was instructed to inform his adversaries that if <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00716.06561" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, <persName n="Steinwehr,,Von,,," id="n0322.0007.00716.06562" reg="default:Steinwehr,Von,,,"><foreName>Von</foreName> <surname>Steinwehr</surname></persName> and the officers who followed their directions were captured, they should be detained in view of possible reprisals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8209"/><persName n="Steinwehr,,Von,,," id="n0322.0007.00716.06563" reg="default:Steinwehr,Von,,,"><foreName>Von</foreName> <surname>Steinwehr</surname></persName>'s orders were neither revoked nor again enforced, the hostages who had been seized by the <rs>Federals</rs> were promptly released, and the regular exchange of prisoners suffered no delay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8210"/>We have stated that private property was generally respected by the armies of both parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8211"/>If this was the case on the part of the military, and if the latter did not often abuse the prerogatives of war in this respect, it was far otherwise with the political authorities of the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8212"/>The Congress at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as well as that of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, enacted laws which seriously affected such property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8213"/>The <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> pleaded, it is true, that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these monstrous confiscation laws which disgraced its legislation afforded the only means at that time for aiming an indirect blow at slavery, by striking, through their human property, the enemies of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, who had taken up arms to protect and extend the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8214"/>But it did wrong in not limiting confiscation to this odious description of property, and in violating, to reach that institution, rights which should be considered most sacred by all legislators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8215"/>We propose now to say a few words concerning these laws, reserving to ourselves the privilege of returning to the subject when we shall have occasion to speak of emancipation and the measures which prepared the way for it in a constitutional point of view.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8216"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these laws was passed by the <rs>Republican</rs> majority in Congress on the <dateStruct value="1861-08-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8217"/>It limited itself to the stipulation that everything employed in aiding and supporting the rebellion in any way whatever should be considered a legitimate object of seizure, and be confiscated by the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8218"/>This clause, which was sufficiently vague to give rise to dangerous interpretations, was evidently applicable to slaves subjected by their masters to services or labors useful to the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8219"/>In the course of the debate the abolitionists managed to introduce an amendment which defined the meaning of the law, declaring that all slaves thus employed <pb id="p.717" n="717"/> should by that fact be freed from the authority of their masters, and that the latter should have no further right to reclaim them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8220"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> decided to reply to the confiscation projects submitted to its rival at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, by a law called the sequestration act, and by a strange coincidence it was also passed on the <dateStruct value="-08-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8221"/>The provisions of this law seemed to have no other object than to indemnify at the expense of Northern proprietors such citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as should be made to suffer by the measure we have just described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8222"/>In reality it also organized a system of confiscation, to be enforced by the most despotic process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8223"/>It provided that all property, personal or real, belonging to the enemies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> should be seized and sold under the direction of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, the latter to use the proceeds to indemnify citizens of the <rs>South</rs> for all the damages caused by the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8224"/>This term <hi rend="italics">enemies</hi> comprised all the inhabitants of the free States, the slave States that had remained loyal to the <rs>Union</rs> being considered by the <rs>Southern</rs> rebels as constituting part, legally, if not <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>, of the power which they sought to establish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8225"/>This law, then, directed the seizure and sale of all property, under whatever form, belonging to citizens of the hostile nation, or even to strangers simply residing on its territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8226"/>It would be difficult to imagine a more <orgName n="General Confiscation" type="misc">general confiscation</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8227"/>The law was aggravated by the means resorted to for the purpose of enforcing its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8228"/>All transfer of property from an enemy to a citizen of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> after the <dateStruct value="1861-05-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> was declared null, and the object of transfer confiscated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8229"/>In order to find out everywhere what personal and <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> was subject to confiscation, an extraordinary mode of proceeding was devised, which, despite the danger there was in disputing any orders emanating from <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00717.06564" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName>, gave rise to strong opposition, and which, even in the courts of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, was justly designated as a new inquisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8230"/>In fact, all the lawyers, the attorneys, the bank-directors, all the agents of corporations or of mercantile houses, exchange brokers, executors or administrators, and generally all persons supposed even by their occupation to have knowledge of the affairs of other people, were obliged to reveal under oath all property attached by the <pb id="p.718" n="718"/> law, or the names of all persons who, having knowledge of such property, had neglected to reveal the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8231"/>Severe penalties were pronounced against all false declarations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8232"/>This terrible law was rigorously applied, especially against all native citizens of Southern States who had remained in the <rs>North</rs> and were serving the <rs>Federal</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8235"/>This new law was not intended, like the previous <num value="1">one</num>, simply to exact some kind of indemnity for the costs of the war from the abettors of the rebellion; for these costs had assumed proportions which would have rendered such a pretext futile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8236"/>It possessed all the features of a penal law, and began by proclaiming the penalty of death against those who should be guilty of treason; but it was evident that this penalty could not be applied to those who were engaged in a war, the combatants in which were treated like ordinary prisoners of war, and the very coincidence between the date of this law and that on which the convention for the exchanges was concluded forbade such an interpretation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8237"/>As a simple menace against the principal political personages of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, or their accomplices in the <rs>North</rs>, this clause, fortunately, remained a dead letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8238"/>It was the same with the lesser penalties, such as imprisonment for <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> and fines of <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure>, pronounced against those who had become associated with the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8239"/>The refusal to put <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00718.06565" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> himself upon trial at the close of the war&mdash;a refusal which was highly creditable to the <rs>Federal</rs> government&mdash;showed at the same time all that is false and worthless in those exceptional laws prompted by the passion of the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8240"/>The forfeiture of political rights pronounced against the same persons was on the contrary, perfectly legitimate, for it was natural that those who had taken up arms against the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be excluded from all participation in the affairs of the government; this penalty, therefore, was applied by the <rs>North</rs> after the victory; the law which decreed this penalty, however, carried its own corrective <pb id="p.719" n="719"/> with it, by conferring upon the <rs>President</rs> unlimited power in the matter of amnesty&mdash;a power of which he was to make ample use to secure the pacification of the <rs>South</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8241"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> object of the law of <dateStruct value="-07-17"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="17">17th</day></dateStruct> was the confiscation of the property of all those who had participated in the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8242"/>It was an aggravation of the preceding measures, striking at all the officers of the <rs>Southern</rs> army, all employs or functionaries of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, all those in the insurgent States who had received their appointments after the secession of those States, and, finally, all the inhabitants of the loyal States who had in any way aided the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8243"/>This penalty was unrighteous in principle, and the power to grant amnesty, reserved to the <rs>President</rs>, only rendered its application the more arbitrary in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8244"/>Fortunately for the honor of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, their Constitution contains an article prohibiting the alienation of property front the heirs of a criminal, and in the most trying times the <rs>Americans</rs> have never hesitated respectfully to comply with the requirements of that Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8245"/>Consequently, on the very day that this new confiscation law was passed, its authors, at the suggestion of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00719.06566" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, destroyed to a certain extent its effects, by declaring that the confiscation was not to extend beyond the term of life of those who had incurred its penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8246"/>Notwithstanding this reservation, the law was not the less unjust, for it was susceptible of being so interpreted as to give rise to the most tyrannical acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8247"/>This actually happened, and the law seemed all the more harsh because it was but seldom and unequally applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8248"/>Among the few examples that might be cited, there is <num value="1">one</num> which deserves particular condemnation; this was the permanent confiscation of the <rs>Arlington</rs> estate, near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, belonging to the family of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00719.06567" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who, in view of his noble conduct at the close of the war, deserved at least to have been allowed to end his days there after the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8252"/>A large number of planters <pb id="p.720" n="720"/> had abandoned the <orgName n="District of LaFourche" type="district">Lafourche district</orgName>, and the adjoining lands situated on the right bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, leaving their slaves on their plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8253"/>It was necessary to find work for the latter, and to this effect to supply the absence of the masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8254"/>This could easily have been done without violence, and without striking at the very principle involved in the right of property in a vast, opulent country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8257"/>At the same time, he appointed a <orgName n="Military Commission" type="commission">military commission</orgName> with power to determine, without right of appeal, the merit of all claims to which this measure might give rise, to administer the plantations thus seized, to sell the land or the produce, to fix the wages of negroes, to purchase, to store away and to resell to the resident proprietors what might be deemed necessary for their own consumption or for sowing purposes; the commission, in short, was authorized to grant permission, to such planters as should give sufficient pledges of their loyalty to the <rs>Union</rs>, to work their own estates by giving them to hope that by such means alone they might merit a revocation of the confiscation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8258"/>We have only been able to present a brief analysis of this decree, but we have said enough to show what was its object and the consequences likely to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8259"/>It suppressed all rights of property, placing it entirely in the hands of the administration, or rather of a few individuals without control and without honesty, and making the <rs>State</rs> the only farmer, the only merchant, the only regulator of the market, and sole arbiter of all transactions, and purveyor to each individual on the very land which he held from his parents or by his own exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8260"/>The labor of the negroes was well enough regulated, or at least the confusion engendered by the war in this kind of labor was diminished; but the consequences of a measure so fatal in its principle were not slow in being felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8261"/>Scandalous fortunes were realized under this administration, and <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> later <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00720.06570" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was obliged to recall <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00720.06571" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> in order to put an end to so many abuses.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8263"/>We have concluded that portion of our inquiry, so far as it concerns the epoch under consideration, which has reference to the relations of the belligerents between themselves, except as to a single point, which is, indeed, the most important of all, the enfranchisement of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8264"/>The law of <dateStruct value="-07-17"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="17">17th</day></dateStruct> marks a new advance in the legislation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which was to lead to the total abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8265"/>Before entering upon the subject we must point out the aggregate legislative measures adopted since the beginning of the war in regard to the same matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8266"/>It will thus be seen how the <rs>Federal</rs> government, after having earnestly endeavored to keep clear of this question, was gradually led to a radical solution of it, and turned emancipation into a powerful weapon against its enemies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8267"/>In the early chapters of this history we have shown the true cause of the war, which was slavery, the concessions through which the <rs>North</rs> vainly tried to prevent a rupture of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the limits which it could not overstep without entirely surrendering the public to the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8268"/>We left off at the night of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>-<dateStruct value="1861-03-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> when Congress, on the eve of adjournment, rejected the <name>Crittenden</name> compromise, which would have introduced slavery into a large portion of the territories where free labor had hitherto prevailed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8269"/>The war put an end to all these vain efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8270"/>But in taking up arms to bring back the <rs>Southern States</rs> into the bosom of the <rs>Union</rs>, the <rs>Federal</rs> government openly proclaimed its intention to respect their constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8271"/>If its triumph had been immediate and thorough, slavery would no doubt have lasted a little while longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8272"/>Consequently, the really sagacious politicians among the representatives of the border States saw that the maintenance of the <rs>Union</rs> could alone prevent the sudden and summary abolition of the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8273"/>It was evident to all those who were not blinded by passion or interest that the struggle, if prolonged, would compel the <rs>North</rs> to display the abolition flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8274"/>The very declarations of the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders were calculated to bring about such a result, and their withdrawal from the <rs>Federal</rs> legislative halls, by ensuring a strong majority <pb id="p.722" n="722"/> to the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, afforded the latter an opportunity to secure at last the ascendency of its political principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8275"/>In short, the mere fact of the war being waged on the soil of the <rs>Southern States</rs> gave rise daily to new difficulties relative to the treatment of slaves, thus bringing the question of emancipation before the public in all its aspects, so as to demonstrate that no human skill could evade the issue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8276"/>Before the severance of the <rs>Union</rs> the fate of the fugitive slaves had been the stumbling-block between the <name>States</name> devoted to free labor and those where slavery prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8277"/>The former had never pretended to seek out the negro on his master's plantation to tell him, <q direct="unspecified">Thou art free.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8278"/>The latter had not only accepted, but approved, of the suppression of the <name>African</name>, slave-trade, because its prohibition favored the internal traffic in slaves; so that this suppression was endorsed by the <rs>Montgomery Constitution</rs> in order to draw the border States, which exported slaves, into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8279"/>But the people of the <rs>North</rs> never could see the owner of human flesh come to seize his property by force on the free soil of their own States without horror; and, on the other hand, Southern planters always considered the exercise of this right as a necessary guarantee to the maintenance of slavery at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8280"/>They succeeded in obtaining a recognition of their demands in the <rs>Federal</rs> statutes, while the fear of seeing the <rs>Union</rs> in jeopardy had induced the <rs>North</rs> since <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct> to endorse the principles of this sad legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8281"/>When this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enactment ceased to be considered sufficient, it was followed by the aggravated law of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, more especially known by the name of the <hi rend="italics">Fugitive Slave law</hi>. The Southern planters, who dreaded the excitement which the publicity of any runaway case might cause among their slaves, often complained that the new law was not applied with sufficient severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8282"/>Their complaints were not well founded, and the statistics bear evidence of the efficacy of this new law. The annual number of runaway slaves, which in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> amounted to <num value="1011">one thousand and eleven</num>, was reduced to <num value="803">eight hundred and three</num> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, notwithstanding the increase of the servile population, and the proportion of fugitives was thus reduced from <num value="1">one</num> out of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> to <num value="1">one</num> out of <num value="5000">five thousand</num>. <q direct="unspecified">These escapes,</q> dryly says the report of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00722.06573" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s government, <q direct="unspecified">cannot cause a <pb id="p.723" n="723"/> more sensible depreciation in the total capital represented by the slave population than is experienced by public stocks in consequence of the daily fluctuations of the <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New York</placeName> market.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8283"/>Some of the <name>States</name> having refused to comply with the requirements of the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law, it was enforced by a decree of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">supreme court</orgName> known as the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8284"/>It will be seen that this law was not abrogated, notwithstanding many efforts to that effect, until the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> period of the war. It was long preserved as a pledge to the border States that slavery should not be abruptly abolished in their territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8285"/>But if no direct blow was aimed at the principle itself, from the outset of the war its application immediately gave rise to serious difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8286"/>Were the military themselves to interfere for the purpose of restoring slaves to their owners?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8287"/>And in that case was a distinction to be made, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> between loyal and rebel owners, then between fugitives, according as they had or had not been engaged in acts of hostility against the <rs>Federal</rs> armies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8288"/>This problem, as we shall find, received various solutions in proportion as Congress entered more and more earnestly on the path of abolition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8289"/>We have already had something to say about <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00723.06574" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s device, when he was in command at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, to reconcile the respect due to the <rs>Constitution</rs> with the idea of equity, which was opposed to the restoration of a slave flying from a master who was in rebellion against this Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8290"/>On the <dateStruct value="1861-05-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1861</year>,</dateStruct> he learned that <num value="3">three</num> negroes had taken refuge in his camps, stating that their owner, <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00723.06575" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, a colonel in the enemy's army, wanted to send them to work on some fortifications on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8292"/>The rumor of this incident, which spread with astonishing rapidity among the servile population of the neighborhood, soon brought a large number of fugitives on the narrow peninsula lying under the bastions of <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8293"/>Whole families were seen to arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8294"/>The adults, whether men or women, could be treated as contrabands, but it was not so with the children; and yet who would have thought of surrendering them and keeping their parents?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8295"/>In reply to requests from <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00723.06577" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> for instructions, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> decided, in a despatch <pb id="p.724" n="724"/> dated <dateStruct value="-05-30"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct>, that so long as a State continued in insurrection all fugitives seeking an asylum with the army should be received and protected without any reference to the question of their freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8296"/>Whilst refusing to restore them for the time being, an exact account was to be kept of their cost and earnings, in order to settle that account with their masters in the event of their being restored at a later day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8297"/>The question thus stated could not fail to provoke warm discussions on the part of the press and at political meetings in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8298"/>Congress took up the subject soon after the beginning of its session, and on the <dateStruct value="-07-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> passed a resolution declaring that in its opinion it was not the duty of soldiers to capture and restore fugitive slaves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8299"/>Meanwhile, the number of these fugitives was daily on the increase; they assembled in the towns in the vicinity of the armies, especially in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and crowded the <rs>Federal</rs> camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8300"/>Most of them were so profoundly ignorant that they could only serve the cause of their protectors by manual labor; some, however, were found possessing sufficient intelligence to furnish the <rs>Northern</rs> generals with valuable information regarding their adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8301"/>But there were others also who were caught acting, more or less voluntarily, as spies in the interest of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and the <rs>Union</rs> officers justly complained of the obstacles which the concourse of fugitives interposed against the maintenance of order and discipline in the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8302"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Mansfield,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00724.06578" reg="mostcommon:Mansfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mansfield</surname></persName>, in command at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, issued an order forbidding all access to these camps on the part of fugitives, and directing corps commanders not to allow them to accompany the troops under any pretext whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8303"/><persName n="Mansfield,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00724.06579" reg="mostcommon:Mansfield,nomatch:0"><surname>Mansfield</surname></persName>, an old man as brave as he was strict, like the majority of old army officers, was strongly opposed to the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8304"/>The formal execution of this order gave rise to complaints which were all the more pointed because the order was directly at variance with the instructions of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00724.06580" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8305"/>It required the decision of some superior authority definitely to regulate the manner in which fugitive slaves were to be treated by the military, the resolution of the lower house simply implying a wish which had not the force of a law. Congress proceeded at <pb id="p.725" n="725"/> once to the consideration of this question by passing the confiscation law, which, as we have said, was promulgated on the <dateStruct value="-08-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8306"/>This law, in assimilating fugitives to contraband of war, declared that no demand for the restoration of slaves who had been in any way employed to the detriment of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies should be admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8307"/>In this case the fugitive slave law was formally suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8308"/>Congress went farther than either <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00725.06581" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> or the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had ventured to go; for so far from making any reservation in behalf of the ultimate rights of the proprietor, it annulled them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8309"/>The law did not explicitly emancipate the fugitives; it even adhered to the hypocritical circumlocutions which Southern men had introduced into national legislation, and only designated them as persons subject to forced labor, but in declaring that they no longer belonged to their masters it virtually set them free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8310"/>This measure, although cautiously worded, since it only referred to slaves used in resisting the national authority, was susceptible of being interpreted as implying the enfranchisement of all fugitives coming from the insurgent States and encouraging the flight of many more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8311"/>The day after the enactment of this law the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> hastened to take measures for securing its execution by addressing a letter to <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00725.06582" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, intended to serve as a rule of conduct to all the commanders of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8312"/>The object of the war being simply the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, the military, wherever the authority of the <rs>Constitution</rs> had not been disputed, were to allow the local courts to follow their own course without interfering in any manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8313"/>In those States where the <rs>Federal</rs> government was not recognized, the latter did not deem it expedient to apply the local laws themselves, when such an application might place arms in the hands of its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8314"/>It was necessary to discriminate between the slaves found at home with their masters and those who came to seek refuge in the <rs>Federal</rs> armies, and in regard to the latter class of refugees to distinguish those whose owners had not participated in the war from those who had been or might be employed in hostile works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8315"/>No encouragement was to be given to slaves found at home with their masters to run away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8316"/>The others were protected by the law <pb id="p.726" n="726"/> against all claims on the part of their owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8317"/>But by what proof, by what kind of inquiry, could this distinction between refugees be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8318"/>and if such were possible, how could the army be made to practice it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8319"/>If <num value="2">two</num> slaves came together to seek the protection of its flag, how could it receive <num value="1">one</num> and surrender the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8320"/>It was decided that all fugitives should be protected alike, and that, being registered as laborers on a special roll, they should wait until the end of the war for their owners to come and claim them if they had still the right to do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8324"/>A month later the government had another opportunity to make known its views upon the same question, and readily availed itself of it to take a new step in the policy it had adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8325"/>The naval expedition to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, under <persName n="Dupont,Commodore,,,," id="n0322.0007.00726.06586" reg="mostcommon:Dupont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Dupont</surname></persName>, was getting ready; in landing at the <rs type="place">Sea</rs> Islands in the midst of an almost exclusively black population, it was to be expected that the slaves, abandoned by their masters, would fall to the care of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8326"/>In this anticipation the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, on the <dateStruct value="-10-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, forwarded special instructions to <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00726.06587" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,T.,W.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who was to command the land-forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8327"/>After recapitulating the instructions he had given to <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00726.06588" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and the principles which had prompted them, he added, as a new matter, that if it should be deemed necessary the refugees might be organized into squads and companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8328"/>Although he took care to add that such a measure did not imply the general arming of fugitives, it was evidently intended to open the way for such an event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8329"/>From the moment that slaves who had fled from owners <pb id="p.727" n="727"/> in arms against the <rs>Union</rs> were not to be surrendered to their masters, these slaves would have to be successively cared for, set to work and enrolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8330"/>But for the present hardly more was thought of than to feed them and give them something to do. Accustomed to spend their time without any forethought, liberty being to them a synonymous term for idleness, they required the controlling guardianship of the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8331"/>The largest number of refugees was to be found at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and <persName n="Wool,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00727.06589" reg="mostcommon:Wool,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wool</surname></persName>, who commanded this place, was obliged, in the month of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, to publish a series of orders regulating their work and wages, whether in the service of the <rs>State</rs> or of officers, fixing the price of their clothing, and establishing a fund in their favor, formed by keeping back a portion of their wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8335"/>The government, faithfully following the line of policy it had traced out for itself, exacted certain explanations from the commander of the armies of the <rs>West</rs>, which amounted to a positive disavowal of the orders he had just issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8336"/>Meanwhile, Congress again met on the <dateStruct value="-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8337"/>The Republican majority had received some additional strength since the last session, and could not fail to consider again, although indirectly, the great problem of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8338"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, in his report to Congress, had intended to recommend the emancipation of all the slaves whose masters had been connected with the rebellion but <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00727.06592" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, more prudent and sagacious than his <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>, thought that the time for resorting to such a measure had not yet arrived, and only allowed him to allude to the treatment of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8339"/>On the <dateStruct value="-12-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> a discussion arose in the <name>Senate</name>, provoked by the abuses to which the <pb id="p.728" n="728"/> concourse of these fugitives in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had given rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8340"/>This city was governed by slave laws, and the local authorities, although mostly appointed by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00728.06593" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s government, were devoted to the maintenance of the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8341"/>Conformably to these laws, every man of color was liable to be seized, imprisoned and given up to any pretended owner who came forward to claim him, if he could not prove his identity as a free man on the evidence of a white citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8342"/>The police of the capital had found a source of shameful profit in the application of these laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8343"/>Fugitives seeking the protection of the <rs>Federal</rs> flag were arrested; and as these unfortunate creatures could find no <num value="1">one</num> to testify in their favor, they were handed over to accomplices, who sold them immediately, dividing the proceeds of such sale with the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8344"/>While waiting for this sad fate, the colored men, thus arrested at random, were subjected to the worst kind of treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8345"/>The Senate passed a resolution ordering them to be set at liberty <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8346"/>The discussions provoked by the interference of the military in the treatment of fugitives brought up the whole question of the fugitive slave law, the application of which was so obnoxious to the people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8347"/>But this law could not be directly attacked without seriously compromising the loyalty of the border States, which, although slave States, had not broken the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, and whose hostility would have been fatal to the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8348"/>Consequently, after some fruitless debates upon propositions which were too radical to be adopted at that time, the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> and the <name>Senate</name> merely instructed, on the <dateStruct value="-12-20"><day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-12-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, their respective judiciary committees to prepare modifications of the law so as to require the owner of the fugitive slave to produce evidence of his loyalty to the <rs>Federal</rs> government prior to its being applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8349"/>The Senate passed, moreover, a resolution ratifying the decisions of the government, and declaring that it was not the province of the <pb id="p.729" n="729"/> military to interfere in restoring slaves to their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8350"/>The law upon this point was definitely settled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8351"/>Thus ended the year <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8352"/>The force of circumstances had brought up the question of slavery in an indirect form; the following year was to witness its solution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8353"/>We shall briefly show how, in proportion as the war added fuel to the passions of men, this solution, from which the wisest statesmen still shrank, soon came to absorb the attention of all, appearing to them at last as a necessity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8354"/>The victory of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> had delivered a portion of the rich plantations with which the coast of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is covered into the hands of the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8355"/>Just as the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had predicted, this territorial occupation presented the question of the treatment of negroes in a new light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8356"/>Indeed, if a few slaves left the estates to which they were attached, to find refuge near the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName>, a much larger number were abandoned by their masters on the approach of that fleet, and the <rs>Union</rs> officers found them quietly settled in their old cabins, near the deserted residence of the proprietor or his agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8357"/>The district occupied by the <rs>Federals</rs> consists of a succession of islands, large and small, adapted to the cultivation of the finest qualities of cotton, whose inhabitants, at least <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of them, were of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8358"/>The situation of these islands protected them against any offensive return on the part of the enemy, and the <rs>Federals</rs> thus found themselves at the beginning of the year obliged to regulate, if not to govern, a population of more than <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> negroes, scattered over <num value="200">two hundred</num> plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8359"/>They had, moreover, to take care of about <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> fugitives, whose number was daily increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8360"/>They had hoped to derive considerable advantage from the occupation of the <rs type="place">Sea</rs> Islands in a commercial point of view, and to obtain a sufficient quantity of the cotton which had given them their celebrity, to relieve the distress caused by the scarcity of that article in the markets of <placeName reg="America City, Nemaha, Kansas" key="tgn,2131963">America</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8361"/>This hope was not to be realized; the trouble caused by the war was too deeply rooted to admit of such a fortunate result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8362"/>But the efforts made in this district to prepare the slaves for the condition of free laborers were none the less important, and the success was as great as could <pb id="p.730" n="730"/> have been expected under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8363"/>Agents were despatched by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> to take charge of this new business, and to administer the plantations abandoned by their owners, on which the slaves lingered without control and without means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8364"/>The rights of the owners were held in reservation, and none of the abuses we have noticed in connection with the administration of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00730.06596" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> were committed in this district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8365"/>A large number of well-disposed persons, Protestant clergymen, schoolmasters, and women, volunteered to assist these agents; about <num value="100">one hundred</num> of them offered their services during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>; and although not a few visionaries and fanatics were found among them, their efforts, under the wise direction of <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00730.06597" reg="mostcommon:Pierce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, the government commissioner, were of great service to the colored people, whom the chances of war had made the wards of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8366"/>This population was deeply attached to the land of their birth; the proprietors, therefore, to make them mistrustful of the <name>Unionists</name>, had incessantly represented to them that it was the intention of the latter to transport the slaves to <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> in order to accomplish their abolition projects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8367"/>When these proprietors took to flight, the negroes refused to follow them, and remained on the plantations, desisting from all work, without, however, committing any excesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8368"/>In many cases the overseers were also slaves, and remained with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8369"/>All applications for reorganizing the work on the plantations were addressed to the latter, for most of them, although deprived of their power, had retained their moral authority, over the simple-minded laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8370"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be done was to prevent starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8371"/>In fact, the culture of the <rs type="place">Sea</rs> Islands was so managed as to produce the quantity of corn, potatoes and pork strictly necessary for the support of laborers, to whom provisions were distributed weekly at the storehouses of the plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8372"/>Nearly all these storehouses had been put under requisition to supply the wants of the fleet and army; the animals had all been carried off or purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8373"/>It soon became necessary to resort to the quartermaster in order to provide for the daily wants of the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8374"/>The rates of wages and the price of manual labor were things unknown in that promised land of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8375"/>In order to cover the expenses of the government, a certain price had to be fixed <pb id="p.731" n="731"/> upon for the daily work of laborers, so as to deduct from these wages the advances made by the <rs>State</rs> in provisions, clothing, etc. Being thus paid for their labor, they were therefore free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8376"/>But this idea of liberty was not fully understood except by the more intelligent class of overseers and artisans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8377"/>The others, in their sad condition, only seemed to dread that they or their families should be sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8378"/>With the exile and the heartrendings that would follow as the most cruel consequence, owing to their inexperience and that instinct of caution which is the weapon of the weak, they seemed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to look upon the <rs>Federals</rs> only in the light of new masters, whom they only begged to spare them from harsh treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8379"/>When, however, they found that these new masters were strong enough to protect them against the old ones, a taste for freedom soon developed itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8380"/>They became assiduous frequenters of schools, where they were taught that alphabet the knowledge of which was formerly the privilege solely of the free man. The very character of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion is incompatible with slavery; it killed it in ancient times, and will kill it whenever this religion is alike professed by the master and the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8381"/>Consequently, in order to render it inoffensive, it had been debased and deformed in the very little instruction which the enslaved race was permitted to receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8382"/>When religion, freed at last from those shameful shackles, came to the slave of yesterday, and told him that his labor belonged to him, that his wife and children were not the property of others, and that there were no duties without rights, however debased he may have been by his former life, he soon began to understand this language, and we shall presently find him on the field of battle rivalling his liberators in courage and devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8383"/>But before the time had arrived when the <rs>Federal</rs> armies found useful auxiliaries in the freedmen, the latter were the cause of frequent embarrassments to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8384"/>The agents of the government sent into <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> were but little acquainted with the country, and still less with the inhabitants of this section of the country, so impenetrable had been until then the barrier erected by slavery, and in perusing the curious reports <num value="1">one</num> would suppose that they were speaking of some region of country yet unexplored by travellers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8385"/>They naturally desired to extend the <pb id="p.732" n="732"/> sphere of their operations, and were incessantly soliciting for some new plantation the protection of the army, the troops of which they would eventually have succeeded in rendering completely inactive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8386"/>On the other hand, both soldiers and officers frequently caused a great deal of disturbance among the agricultural population, and they were finally forbidden to approach the plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8387"/>But this measure soon ceased to be of any great avail, and in the month of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> it was deemed expedient to withdraw the supreme control of the freedmen from the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>, and give it to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, in order to avoid conflicts which might have weakened the military authority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8388"/>In proportion as the question of the treatment of slaves in the <name>States</name> hostile to the <rs>Union</rs> became more difficult and absorbing, the judicious and moderate men of the <rs>North</rs> entered more seriously into the consideration of the means for directly solving the problem of slavery in the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8389"/>It was, in fact, the loyalty shown by some of these States to the <rs>Union</rs>, which kept the great mass of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> from resorting to the immediate and complete abolition of slavery, as a powerful instrument of war. But, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, it was evident that the protection granted to fugitives by the army, that confiscation and the constantly increasing enfranchisements of slaves, and the introduction of free labor on the plantations of the <rs type="place">Sea</rs> Islands, constituted too serious a blow against the servile institution not to have a rebounding effect upon <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, despite all the provisions of the law which still protected it, and it was no longer to be seriously believed in the month of <dateStruct value="1862-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, that, the <rs>Union</rs> once restored, slavery would be retained as in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8390"/>On the other hand, the secession leaders justly thought that by the maintenance of slavery on the soil of the border States it would only require a few military successes to rally those States to the support of their cause; it was evident that if the <rs>South</rs> could constitute herself an independent power, all the countries where the servile institution existed would be obliged, out of regard for their own interests, to join her. It was important, therefore, to deprive the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for ever of all hope of dominating in the centre of the continent, by sundering the ties which might have bound to it the <name>States</name> occupying that <pb id="p.733" n="733"/> region of country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8391"/>From that moment it became the duty of loyalty as well as policy to anticipate the crisis with which those States were threatened, by offering them a peaceful and legal solution of the question of slavery through purchase and gradual emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8392"/>This is what <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00733.06598" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> did in his message to Congress of <dateStruct value="-03-6"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="6">6th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8393"/>He proposed not to interfere with the legislation of States to force emancipation upon them, but to declare that the <rs>Federal</rs> government would be ready to assist those States financially if they would take the initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8394"/>This proposition was the subject of a resolution passed by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="-03-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8395"/>But the opposition of the local governments, and of the representatives of the <name>States</name> concerned, rendered fruitless for a time such prudent and considerate overtures of the central power, and <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00733.06599" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, despite all his efforts, was unable to persuade them to co-operate in carrying out his plan.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8396"/>However, as the formal orders of the government regarding the treatment of slaves who sought refuge near the armies were not always executed, Congress determined to give them a legal sanction; and on the <dateStruct value="-02-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and the <dateStruct value="-03-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> both the <name>Senate</name> and the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> introduced a new article in the military code, prohibiting officers, at the risk of dismissal, from interfering to restore fugitive slaves to their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8397"/>Notwithstanding the powers with which the government was thus armed, great difficulty was experienced in applying this law in those regiments whose commanders openly professed their sympathies in favor of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8398"/>We shall have many instances to record of open violations of this law, and at the very gates of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; less than a fortnight after Congress had passed the law, slave-owners from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> were seen to visit a Federal camp, provided with an order from <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00733.06600" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, to take away some slaves whom they suspected to have taken refuge in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8399"/>In order to secure the execution of the will of Congress, however, even in the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> it required a special order from <persName n="Doubleday,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00733.06602" reg="mostcommon:Doubleday,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Doubleday</surname></persName>, commanding the place, on the <dateStruct value="-04-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, which recapitulated <pb id="p.734" n="734"/> the several clauses of the law, and forbade officers from admitting to their camps the employes of the civil police engaged in the search of slaves, without a permit signed by himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8474"/>If the arming of a few negroes at <placeName key="tgn,2391938" n="1.000 303" reg="hilton head, beaufort, south carolina">Hilton Head</placeName> had already caused such an intense commotion in the <rs>South</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> may imagine the effect produced by the law which officially sanctioned their admission into the <rs>Federal</rs> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8475"/>The proud planters revolted at the idea of having to fight their former slaves on equal terms and to treat them like regular enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8476"/>It was precisely at this period that the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents signed the cartel of exchanges which was to be subsequently suspended in consequence of this very question concerning the treatment of negro soldiers; but as the <rs>Confederate</rs> prisons did not as yet contain any of these soldiers, the <rs>Richmond</rs> authorities, who were greatly interested in the conclusion of this agreement, smothered their wrath.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8477"/>A strong prejudice still prevailed, even in the <rs>North</rs>, against men of color&mdash;a prejudice which had alone inspired and encouraged the projects of emigration brought forward at the time as a natural consequence of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8478"/>It was not thought that these men could ever make good soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8479"/>Many men would have objected to serve by their side, and several generals were opposed to their being enrolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8480"/>Thus, <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0322.0007.00741.06630" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, remembering his former affinity with the slavery party, deprived <num value="1">one</num> of his lieutenants, <persName n="Phelps,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00741.06631" reg="mostcommon:Phelps,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Phelps</surname></persName>, of his command, because the latter had organized <num value="5">five</num> companies of negroes without having received special orders from the <rs>President</rs> to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8481"/>It was, therefore, important that the least possible latitude should be allowed to the interpretation of the new law, called the confiscation law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8483"/>It ended with an assurance to fugitive negroes employed by the government in any capacity that they should never be sent back to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8484"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> point remained now unsettled&mdash; <pb id="p.742" n="742"/> whether at the close of the war their former masters would be entitled to indemnity or not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8485"/>The truce concluded between the <name>Republicans</name> and War Democrats for the common defence of the <rs>Constitution</rs> did not prevent the question of slavery from being brought to the surface in every form; it was warmly discussed by the press, at all public meetings and in all the <rs>State</rs> legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8487"/>Despite his cautious language, the <rs>President</rs> did not conceal on which side lay his convictions; but he did not allow himself to be carried away by his abolition sentiments, and thought only of his special mission, which was to support the <rs>Constitution</rs> and restore the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8488"/>He did not think he had a right to compromise that restoration either by premature abolition or by an excess of deference to the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8489"/>Like a skilful pilot with his hand at the helm, he watched the direction of the strong wind which impelled the vessel entrusted to his care onward, ready to alter his course as soon as that wind should shift to some other point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8490"/>The day came when he resolved upon the course to pursue, courageously took upon himself the responsibility of the act, and executed it with determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8491"/>We think that he chose the opportune moment; it was the day following the victory of <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName>, and this great decision was like a response to the invasion of the <name>States</name> that had remained loyal to the <rs>Union</rs> by the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8492"/>Had he taken this step sooner, he would have failed in his duties to the <rs>Constitution</rs>; if he had delayed longer, he would have exposed himself to the charge of having neglected a powerful means of bringing the war to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8493"/>On the <dateStruct value="-09-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, America learned that the <rs>President</rs> had proclaimed the complete abolition of slavery in all the <name>States</name> in rebellion against the <rs>Union</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8496"/>A shout of joy from the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName> hailed this plain and categorical declaration; nothing more was wanted to exasperate the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, especially in the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8497"/>Many persons both wise and enlightened felt aggrieved at this proclamation, calculated to produce discord; they could not understand that its object was to maintain, as the <rs>President</rs> was bound to do, the constitutional rights of the <name>States</name> loyal to the <rs>Union</rs>, and that it merely endorsed the fact, which was daily becoming more palpable, that the <rs>Federal</rs> government could no longer protect slavery in those States which for the last <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> had been in open rebellion against its authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8498"/>The masses throughout the country, although more and more hostile to slavery in principle, received the proclamation with a certain degree of astonishment, and <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00743.06636" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, without having anything to regret, was obliged to acknowledge that in this instance he had forestalled public opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8499"/>The <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> felt this, and determined to take advantage of it. This party numbered many sincere patriots, who had sacrificed all their political alliances to sustain the legal authority of the <rs>President</rs> elected by their opponents, but who, <pb id="p.744" n="744"/> nevertheless, firmly believed in the necessity of maintaining and protecting slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8500"/>They continued to support the <rs>Federal</rs> government in the struggle it had undertaken against the <rs>South</rs>, but resolved to thwart its policy by trying to regain a majority in Congress, which was to be partially renewed before its next meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8501"/>Their plan of action was perfectly defined in the order issued by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0322.0007.00744.06637" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> on the <dateStruct value="-10-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, which we have quoted elsewhere, wherein, after reminding his soldiers of their duty to obey without questioning the orders of the <rs>President</rs>, who was their government superior, he added that it was in their power to rectify the errors of the government by their ballots at the next election.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8502"/>These elections proved, in fact, favorable to Democratic candidates, and of <num value="124">one hundred and twenty-four</num> representatives elected in the early part of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, <num value="67">sixty-seven</num> belonged to this party; the government thus lost <num value="51">fifty-one</num> votes, and instead of a majority of <num value="41">forty-one</num>, it found itself in a minority of <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8503"/>This result, without changing its policy, compelled it to be more conciliatory toward the party which had just achieved such a success than it had been in the past.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8504"/>Congress assembled on the <dateStruct value="-12-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8505"/>The subject of emancipation occupied an important space in the <rs>President</rs>'s message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8506"/>He treated the question in a simple and dignified manner, with a moderation and logical force which showed that his strong and upright mind was gathering strength amid the extraordinary difficulties of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8507"/>After clearly demonstrating that the division of the republic into several nationalities was a thing impossible, that the same Constitution must govern all its parts and represent their common interest as in the past, he asserted that unless the supremacy of slavery was recognized, it was necessary to fix a term for the existence of that institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8508"/>It was the cause of the war; by condemning it in a definite manner, this fatal struggle would be speedily ended, and no sacrifice should be considered too great to secure that object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8509"/>No change was to be introduced in the measures adopted to put down slavery in the <name>States</name> which persisted in their rebellion against the national authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8510"/>The confiscation laws should continue to be enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8511"/>The proclamation of <dateStruct value="-09-22"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, which was to go into operation <pb id="p.745" n="745"/> on the <dateStruct value="1863-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> was communicated to Congress simply by way of information, and not submitted to its sanction, the <rs>President</rs> having acted in the plenitude of the powers which had been conferred upon him. But Congress in its turn had to decide graver questions yet. The moment had arrived for grappling with the very principle of slavery and solving the question by a modification of the <rs>Federal</rs> compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8512"/>Resuming his project of emancipating the slaves by compensating the owners who had remained loyal to the <rs>Federal</rs> laws, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0322.0007.00745.06638" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> proposed a constitutional amendment to Congress guaranteeing an indemnity to all the <name>States</name> who should proclaim the emancipation of slaves, either immediate or gradual, provided it should be accomplished before the close of the present century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8513"/>All the slaves emancipated by the chances of war should be declared definitely free, but those owners who had taken no part in the rebellion should be entitled to compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8514"/>Finally, while acknowledging the want of success that had attended the emigration plans, and condemning the prejudices against the colored race which had generally inspired them, he asked Congress to encourage them if they were deemed practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8515"/>This was the sum total of the propositions contained in the proclamation of <dateStruct value="-09-22"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct> characterizing the policy to be followed by the government in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8516"/>In those States which, being at war against the <rs>Constitution</rs>, could no longer invoke its protection in behalf of their particular laws, he disposed of the question in a radical way by no longer recognizing the servile institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8517"/>Where this institution had still a legal existence, he proposed to abolish it gradually by observing all the prescribed forms&mdash;that is to say, by a <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote of each House of Congress and the sanction of the <rs>State</rs> legislatures in <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8518"/>In order to accomplish this object, he recommended the adoption of a compromise, which, not being entirely satisfactory either to the partisans of absolute and immediate abolition or those who favored the pure and simple maintenance of slavery, might serve as a common ground for all the supporters of the <rs>Union</rs> to rally upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8519"/>The problem of slavery was at last placed before the nation by its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> magistrate in a truly statesmanlike manner, without passion <pb id="p.746" n="746"/> and without illusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8520"/>But however wise this proposition may have been, it was to meet with too much opposition from both parties to admit of its being adopted as a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8521"/>Those who should have been most eager to accept it, if they had understood their own interests, were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to reject it. They thus allowed the opportunity to pass of facilitating the transition from slave to free labor; and when, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later, the constitutional amendment was passed as the conseqence of Northern victories, it determined the final abolition of slavery under a much more radical form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8522"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s proposition required to be maturely considered by both houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8523"/>Before confronting such an ordeal, it was necessary that it should be discussed by the press and thoroughly sustained by public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8524"/>Whilst this great debate was pending, both parties, whose forces were now more equally balanced in Congress, began contending about the text of the proclamation of <dateStruct value="-09-22"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8525"/>The Democrats attacked it as unconstitutional in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, where their strength was greater than in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8526"/>But the government came off victorious, having obtained on the <dateStruct value="-12-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> a majority of <num value="17">seventeen</num> votes upon this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8527"/>Nothing was left for the <rs>President</rs> to do but to enforce the measures he had announced on the <dateStruct value="-09-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8529"/>The list of these States comprised <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> Carolinas, and, finally, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, with the exception of those districts which were under the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8530"/>The proclamation naturally did not extend to the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, which had never participated in the rebellion; nor to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> or <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, which, although rent by civil war, had not voted for secession; nor even to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, which within the last year had legally returned to the fold of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8531"/>This proclamation, sufficient to render the name of its author illustrious, marked the beginning of a year which was to witness still more sanguinary scenes than the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8532"/>It also inaugurated a new epoch, and the conflict, freed from the remembrace <pb id="p.747" n="747"/> of past concessions, assumed henceforth its real character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8839"/>These are belied by <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00761.07100" reg="nearbymention:Porter,F.,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s whole career, who, both as a soldier and a chieftain, had been tried on more than <num value="1">one</num> battle-field, and whose devotion to the cause he served cannot be called into question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8840"/>We shall only speak of those which rest upon facts or definite specifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8842"/>He asserted that this manoeuvre was practicable, and that it would have assured the defeat of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8844"/>At a later period, when the facts became more fully known, and the official reports of the <rs>Confederate</rs> generals were given to the public, it was shown that the junction of the <num value="2">two</num> Confederate corps was effected long before <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00761.07103" reg="nearbymention:Porter,F.,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> could have reached the point which had been indicated to him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8846"/>Thus far the censure is well founded, although it must be acknowledged that, in order to execute such a movement, <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00761.07108" reg="nearbymention:Porter,F.,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> would have been obliged to change the direction he had been ordered to follow in his formal instructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8851"/>Now, this order, as we have already stated, was only despatched at <time value="4:30oclock">half-past 4 o'clock</time>, and <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00762.07114" reg="nearbymention:Porter,F.,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> declared that he did not receive it until the moment when night rendered its execution impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8852"/>The movements of the several corps had been so frequently countermanded, that the officers of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> were unable to ascertain the exact position of each, so that the delay in the transmission of that order is not to be wondered at. On the other hand, <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00762.07115" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, in his anxiety to prove that <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00762.07116" reg="nearbymention:Porter,F.,,,"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s inaction had permitted the enemy to concentrate all his forces upon that portion of his line which was defended by <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0322.0008.00762.07117" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:3"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, quotes the official report of the latter.
