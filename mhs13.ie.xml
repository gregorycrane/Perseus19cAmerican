<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>I was then <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> old, and I went with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>We went eastward on <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, passed the end of <address><street n="Fulton street">Fulton street</street></address>, almost to the town frontier, and the whole warlike scene was before us. <pb id="p.94" n="94"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>It was a lonely region then, not populated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>There was no <placeName reg="Fellsway">Fellsway</placeName> and no trolley line about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>No shops, no <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post office</orgName>, no school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Hardly a house was in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>Indeed, I remember only <num value="1">one</num>; it stood somewhat south of <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, and was inhabited by a family whose name was <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Gale,,,,," id="n0334.0017.00094.00855" reg="mostcommon:Gale,nomatch:0"><surname>Gale</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>It was said to be the last house in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>On the north side of the highway was a large plain, nearly level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>At its north end rose a high craggy ridge bearing plenty of rocks, junipers, etc. Near <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address> stood the artillerists with several field pieces, all pointing north and in extremely active and reckless service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Next north of the cannon stood companies of infantry over whose heads the cannon were supposed to fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>Far away on the rough upland were countless <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0334.0017.00094.00856" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName></q> in wonderful paint and feathers, flitting about among the rocks and bushes and wasting lots of powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>At length the cannonading ceased, the infantry charged and the <rs>Medford</rs> boy contingent went with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>Nobody hindered the boys, but as the charge ascended the rocky battlements of the ridge the noise of musketry was fearful and the warwhoops even more so. It seemed to us that the white men were gradually forcing the red ones back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>In the real historic fights this was generally the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>In the sham fights it was always so. Still, we could not tell very well, as the confusion was awful, the smoke dense, and the thunder of the cannon and the shouting endless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>Evening was approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>We had eaten nothing since breakfast, and had no money to buy any of the gorgeous pies and cookies for sale at little tables along <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>Unless a few ball cartridges were inadvertently used on that battle day I do not think the <rs type="place">North Mountain</rs> was hurt much, or anything deposited in its chasms or scaurs to puzzle future historical societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>I say inadvertently, for no <num value="1">one</num> who knew <persName n="Osgood,Miss,Lucy,,," id="n0334.0017.00094.00857" reg="default:Osgood,Lucy,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Lucy</foreName> <surname>Osgood</surname></persName> as I did would ever venture to cannonade her wood lot, to say nothing of the poor <rs>Indians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>But this is not the whole of my story.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>As we approached it, walking as before on <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, we were struck with the different character of the noises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>The furious gun-fire of <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> was no longer in evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>The cannon reports were of rather slow recurrence and seemingly at regular intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>The field-pieces were in their former places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>The artillerists were by them, but were deliberate and very careful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>No infantry were on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>No Indians were anywhere in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>But there were targets, <num value="2">two</num> or more, standing on the lower slope of the bluff and very near the level of the plain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>No blank cartridges were being used then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>We could see the dust spouts as the shots struck the rugged slope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>Evidently the <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> merits of this locality as a safe place for artillery practice had been discovered.</p>
