<head>Preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>In offering this volume to the public I shall attempt no apology for its shortcomings, other than to say that its production is the result of the unexpected popularity of the series of articles, relating to the illustrious subject of whom it mainly treats, which were commenced in the <orgName n="New York Independent" type="newspaper">New York <name>Independent</name></orgName> soon after the assassination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Written in a spirit of enthusiasm and affection, which there has been no effort to disguise, the book is, nevertheless, a simple matter-of-fact record of daily experience and observation, fragmentary, but true, in all essential particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>There has been no disposition to select from, embellish, or suppress, any portion of the material in my possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The incidents given were not in any sense isolated exceptions to the daily routine of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0001.00000.00001" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>My aim has been throughout these pages to portray <hi rend="italics">the man</hi> as he was revealed to me, without any attempt at idealization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/><pb id="p.vi" n="vi"/> </p> 
<p>In addition to my own reminiscences, I have woven into the book various personal incidents, published and unpublished, which bear intrinsic evidence of genuineness,--attaching in these instances, where it seemed necessary and proper, the sources of such contributions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I am not <num value="1">one</num> of those inclined to believe that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0001.00000.00002" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, in the closing months of his career, reached the full measure of his greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Man may not read the future: but it is my firm conviction, that, had he lived through his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> term, he would have continued to grow, as he had grown, in the estimation and confidence of his countrymen; rising to a grander moral height with every emergency, careful always to weigh every argument opposed to his convictions, but, once mounted upon those convictions, grounded in righteousness, as immovable as <num value="1">one</num> of the giant ranges of our own <placeName reg="Rocky Mountains, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7014356">Rocky Mountains</placeName>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Aspiring in no sense to the dignity of a biography, this volume will fulfil its object if it helps to any better knowledge of <num value="1">one</num>, who, apart from the reverence with which he ever will be regarded for his connection with the cause of human Freedom, was the best product and exemplar which the world has yet seen of American soil and institutions; the <pb id="p.vii" n="vii"/> study of whose character, illustrating as it did the highest form of statesmanship, founded upon truth, justice, and solid integrity, combining the deepest wisdom with a child-like freshness and simplicity,will be of perpetual interest and value.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I leave to other and abler pens the proper estimate of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0023.0002.00009.00003" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as a ruler and statesman, his work and place in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Favored during the year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> with several months of personal intercourse with him, I shall attempt in these pages to write the story of that association; not for any value which the record will have in itself; but for the glimpses it may afford of the person and character of the man,--every detail of whose life is now invested with enduring interest for the <rs>American</rs> people.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>That Art should aim to embody and express the spirit and best thought of its own age seems selfevident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If it fails to do this, whatever else it may accomplish, it falls short of its highest object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It cannot dwell always among classic forms, nor clothe its conceptions in the imagery of an old and wornout world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It must move on, if it is to keep pace <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> with that <quote>increasing purpose which through the ages runs,</quote> and its ideals must be wrought out of the strife of a living humanity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It has been well said by a recent writer: <quote>The record of the human family to the advent of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0023.0003.00010.00004" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, was the preparation of the photographic plate for its image.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>All subsequent history is the bringing out of the divine ideal of true manhood.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Slowly, but surely, through the centuries, is this purpose being accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Human slavery has been the material type or expression of spiritual bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On the lowest or physical plane, it has symbolized the captivity and degradation of our higher nature; with the breaking in of new light, and the inspiration of a deeper life, it is inevitably doomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>That man, to attain the full development of the faculties implanted in him, must be in spiritual and physical freedom, is a principle which lies at the foundation of all government; and the enfranchisement of a race to-day thus becomes the assertion and promise of a true and coming Emancipation for all men.</p></div1> 
<div1 id="c.4" type="chapter" n="4">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>When <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0023.0004.00010.00005" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, called from the humblest rank in life to preside over the nation during the most momentous period of its history, uttered his Proclamation of Freedom,--shattering forever the chains which bound <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of human beings in slavery; an act unparalleled for moral <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> grandeur in the history of mankind,--it was evident to all who sought beneath the surface for the cause of the war that the crisis was past,--that so surely as Heaven is on the side of Right and Justice, the <rs>North</rs> would triumph in the great struggle which had assumed the form of a direct issue between Freedom and Slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In common with many others, I had from the beginning of the war believed that the government would not be successful in putting down a rebellion based upon slavery as its avowed corner-stone, without striking a death-blow at the institution itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>As the months went on, and disappointment and disaster succeeded <num value="1">one</num> another, this conviction deepened into certainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>When at length, in obedience to what seemed the very voice of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the thunderbolt was launched, and, like the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun at <placeName reg="Concord, Merrimack, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013647">Concord</placeName>, <quote>was heard around the world,</quote> all the enthusiasm of my nature was kindled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <quote>beast</quote> Secession, offspring of the <quote>dragon</quote> Slavery, drawing in his train <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> part of our national stars, was pierced with the deadly wound which could not be healed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It was the combat between <persName n="Michael,,,,," id="n0023.0004.00011.00006" reg="mostcommon:Michael,nomatch:0"><surname>Michael</surname></persName> and Satan of Apocalyptic vision, reenacted before the eyes of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.</p></div1> 
<div1 id="c.5" type="chapter" n="5">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>To paint a picture which should commemorate this new epoch in the history of Liberty, was a <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> dream which took form and shape in my mind towards the close of the year <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>,--the year made memorable in its dawn by the issue of the final decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>With little experience to adapt me for the execution of such a work, there had nevertheless come to me at times glowing conceptions of the true purpose and character of Art, and an intense desire to do something expressive of appreciation of the great issues involved in the war. The painters of old had delighted in representations of the birth from the ocean of <persName n="Venus,,,,," id="n0023.0005.00012.00007" reg="mostcommon:Venus,nomatch:0"><surname>Venus</surname></persName>, the goddess of love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><measure n="90years" type="date">Ninety years</measure> ago upon this Western continent had been witnessed &mdash; no dream of fable, but a substantial fact &mdash; the immaculate conception of Constitutional Liberty; and at length through great travail its consummation had been reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The longprayed &mdash; for year of jubilee had come; the bonds of the oppressed were loosed; the prison doors were opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><quote>Behold,</quote> said a voice, <quote>how a Man may be exalted to a dignity and glory almost divine, and give freedom to a race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Surely Art should unite with Eloquence and Poetry to celebrate such a theme.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/></p> 
<p>I conceived of that band of men, upon whom the eyes of the world centred as never before upon ministers of state, gathered in council, depressed, perhaps disheartened at the vain efforts of many months to restore the supremacy of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I saw, in thought, the head of the nation, bowed down with his weight of care and responsibility, <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> solemnly announcing, as he unfolded the prepared draft of the <name>Proclamation</name>, that the time for the inauguration of this policy had arrived; I endeavored to imagine the conflicting emotions of satisfaction, doubt, and distrust with which such an announcement would be received by men of the varied characteristics of the assembled councillors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>For several weeks the design of the picture was slowly maturing, during which time, however, no line was drawn upon paper or canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Late <num value="1">one</num> evening, absorbed in thought upon the subject, I took up an unframed photograph lying carelessly in my room, and upon the blank side of this, roughly and hastily sketched, was embodied the central idea of the composition as it had shaped itself in my mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>To <num value="1">one</num> disposed to look for coincidences in daily life, and regard its events as no mere succession of accidents, there must often come those which wear a deep significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In seeking a point of unity or action for the picture, I was impressed with the conviction that important modifications followed the reading of the <name>Proclamation</name> at the suggestion of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, and I determined upon such an incident as the moment of time to be represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I was subsequently surprised and gratified when <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0005.00013.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself, reciting the history of the <name>Proclamation</name> to me, dwelt particularly upon the fact that not only was the time of its issue decided by <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n0023.0005.00013.00009" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s advice, but that <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> of the most important words in the document was added through his strenuous representations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The central thought of the picture once decided upon and embodied, the rest naturally followed; <num value="1">one</num> after another the <num value="7">seven</num> figures surrounding the <rs>President</rs> dropped into their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Those supposed to have held the purpose of the <name>Proclamation</name> as their long conviction, were placed prominently in the foreground in attitudes which indicated their support of the measure; the others were represented in varying moods of discussion or silent deliberation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A few evenings after the completion of the design I went to see a friend who I knew was intimate with <persName n="Colfax,the Honorable,Schuyler,,," id="n0023.0005.00014.00010" reg="default:Colfax,Schuyler,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Schuyler</foreName> <surname>Colfax</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lovejoy,the Honorable,Owen,,," id="n0023.0005.00014.00011" reg="default:Lovejoy,Owen,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Owen</foreName> <surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName>, through whom I hoped to obtain <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0005.00014.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s assent to my plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I revealed to him my purpose, and asked his assistance in carrying it into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>During the following week he went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and in company with <persName n="Colfax,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0005.00014.00013" reg="nearbymention:Colfax,Schuyler,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Colfax</surname></persName> called upon the <rs>President</rs>, and laid before him my project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He kindly listened to the details, and then said: <quote>In short, if I understand you, you wish me to consent to sit to this artist for the picture?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>My friends acknowledged this to be the object of their errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0005.00014.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> at once, with his accustomed kindness, promised his cooperation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The last day of the year the <name>Hon</name>. <persName n="Lovejoy,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0005.00014.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lovejoy,Owen,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName>, whom I had never met, but who had become warmly interested in the execution of the work, being in New York, called at my studio with the wife of my <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> friend, who had been my earnest advocate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>At the close of the interview he remarked, in his quaint way, taking me by the hand, <quote>In the words of Scripture, my good friend, I can say now I believe, not on account of the saying of the woman, but because I have seen for myself.</quote></p></div1> 
<div1 id="c.6" type="chapter" n="6"> 
<head>V.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Impracticable as my scheme had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seemed, the way was thus opened for its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>When fairly committed to the purpose, however, the want of means and the magnitude of the undertaking almost disheartened me. My original plan embraced a canvas sufficiently large for a life-size group of the <rs>President</rs> and entire Cabinet; to paint such a picture would consume many months, perhaps years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Enthusiasm alone would never accomplish the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The few friends to whom I should have felt at liberty to apply for help were not wealthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Who outside of these could be persuaded that a work of the character and proportions contemplated, undertaken by an artist of no experience in historical studies, would not end in utter failure? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I had left my home at the usual hour <num value="1">one</num> morning, pondering the difficulty which, like <persName n="Bunyan,,,,," id="n0023.0006.00015.00016" reg="mostcommon:Bunyan,nomatch:0"><surname>Bunyan</surname></persName>'s lions, seemed now to block the way. As <num value="1">one</num> alternative after another presented itself to my mind and was rejected, the prospect appeared less and less hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I at length found myself in <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> at <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> the foot of the stairs leading up to my studio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A gentleman at this moment attracted my attention, standing with his back towards me, looking at some pictures exposed in the window of the shop below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Detecting, as I thought, something familiar in his air and manner, I waited until he turned his face, and then found I was not mistaken; it was an old acquaintance who <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> before lived near me in <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, engaged in a similar struggle for a livelihood with myself, though his profession was law instead of art. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We had both changed our residences and had not met for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>After a cordial greeting, he accepted my invitation to ascend to the studio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I had heard that he had been successful in some business ventures, but the matter made but little impression upon me, and had been forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Suddenly there seemed to come into my mind the words: <quote>This man has been sent to you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Full of the singular impression, I laid before him my conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He heard me through, and then asked if I was sure of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0023.0006.00016.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s consent and cooperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I informed him of the pledge which had been given me. <quote>Then,</quote> said he, <quote>you shall paint the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Take plenty of time,--make it the great work of your life,--and draw upon me for whatever funds you will require to the end.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Shortly after <time value="12pm">noon</time> of the following day, I rang the bell at <persName n="Lovejoy,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0007.00017.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lovejoy,Owen,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName>'s residence on <address><street n="15 Street">Fifteenth Street</street></address>. To my sorrow, I found him very ill; but it was hoped by his friends that he was then improving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Though very feeble, he insisted upon seeing me, and calling for writing materials, sat up in bed to indite a note introducing me to the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This, handed to me open; I read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/></p> 
<p><quote>It is a somewhat remarkable fact,</quote> he subsequently remarked, <quote>that there were just <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> between the dates of the <num value="2">two</num> proclamations issued upon the <dateStruct value="-09-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> and the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>I had not made the calculation at the time.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/></p> 
<p>Having concluded this interesting statement, the <rs>President</rs> then proceeded to show me the various positions occupied by himself and the different members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, on the occasion of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/><quote>As nearly as I remember,</quote> said he, <quote>I sat near the head of the table; the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> were here, at my right hand; the others were grouped at the left.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/></p> 
<p>At this point, I exhibited to him a pencil sketch of the composition as I had conceived it, with no knowledge of the facts or details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The leading idea of this I found, as I have stated on a previous page, to be entirely consistent with the account I had just heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I saw, however, that I should have to reverse the picture, placing the <rs>President</rs> at the other end of the table, to make it accord with his description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I had resolved to discard all <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> appliances and tricks of picture-making, and endeavor, as faithfully as possible, to represent the scene as it actually transpired; room, furniture, accessories, all were to be painted from the actualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It was a scene <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only in historical importance and interest to that of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>; and I felt assured, that, if honestly and earnestly painted, it need borrow no interest from imaginary curtain or column, gorgeous furniture or allegorical statue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Assenting heartily to what is called the <quote>realistic</quote> school of art, when applied to the illustration of historic events, I felt in this case, that I had no more right to depart from the facts, than has the historian in his record. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>When friends said to me, as they frequently did, <quote>Your picture will be bald and barren,</quote> my reply was, <quote>If I cannot make the portraiture of the scene itself sufficiently attractive without the false glitter of tapestry hangings, velvet <rs n="table cloths" type="product">table-cloths</rs>, and marble columns, then I shall at least have the satisfaction of having failed in the cause of truth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I reasoned in this way: The most important document submitted to a cabinet during our existence as a nation is under discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>A spectator permitted to look in upon that scene would give little thought and small heed to the mere accessories and adjuncts of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>His mind would centre upon the immortal document,--its anxious author, conscious of his solemn responsibility, announcing <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> his matured and inflexible purpose to his assembled councillors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>He would listen with unparalleled eagerness to the momentous sentences uttered for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the ears of men, and to the discussion upon them, impatient of mere formalities and technicalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Should a thought be sprung of important bearing, or an overlooked contingency be brought forward, how intently would its effect be watched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>What varying emotions, consequent upon peculiarities of temperament and character, would be expressed in the countenances of the different individuals composing the group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>How each in turn would be scanned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Above all, the issues involved:--the salvation of the <name>Republicthe</name> freedom of a Race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/><quote>Surely,</quote> I said, <quote>such a scene may be painted, and abiding if not absorbing interest secured, without the aid of conventional trappings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The republican simplicity of the room and furniture, with its thronging associations, will more than counterbalance the lack of splendor, and the artistic mania for effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I will depend solely for my success upon the interest of the subject, and its truthfulness of representation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>And this purpose I carried with me to the end.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sketch of the composition, as it was afterward placed upon the canvas, was matured, I believe, the same afternoon, or the following <name>Monday</name> <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> after the interview recorded above, upon the back of a visiting card; my pockets affording evidence of the employment of all loose material at hand in leisure moments, in the study of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The final arrangement of the figures was the result of much thought and many combinations, though the original conception as to the moment of time and incident of action was preserved throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The general arrangement of the group, as described by the <rs>President</rs>, was fortunately entirely consistent with my purpose, which was to give that prominence to the different individuals which belonged to them respectively in the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>There was a curious mingling of fact and allegory in my mind, as I assigned to each his place on the canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> elements in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, the radical and the conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The chief powers of a government are War and Finance: the ministers of these were at his right, -the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, symbolizing the great struggle, in the immediate foreground; the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, actively supporting the new policy, standing by the <rs>President</rs>'s side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The Army being, the right hand, the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> may very properly be styled the left hand of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The place for the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> seemed, therefore, very naturally to be on <persName n="Lincoin,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0009.00027.00044" reg="mostcommon:Lincoin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoin</surname></persName>'s <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> left, at the rear of the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>To the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, as the great expounder of the principles of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, the profound and sagacious statesman, would the attention of all at such a time be given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Entitled to precedence in discussion by his position in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, he would necessarily form <num value="1">one</num> of the central figures of the group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The <num value="4">four</num> <rs type="role" reg="chief-Officer">chief officers</rs> of the government were thus brought, in accordance with their relations to the <name>Administration</name>, nearest the person of the <rs>President</rs>, who, with the manuscript proclamation in hand, which he had just read, was represented leaning forward, listening to, and intently considering the views presented by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, absorbed in the constitutional questions involved, with folded arms, was placed at the foot of the table opposite the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Interior">Secretary of the Interior</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs>, occupying the less conspicuous positions of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, seemed to take their proper places in the background of the picture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>When, at length, the conception as thus described was sketched upon the large canvas, and <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0009.00028.00045" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> came in to see it, his gratifying remark, often subsequently repeated, was, <quote>It is as good as it can be made.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Whether the story bears any analogy to that by which the works of others have been produced, or the composition conforms to established rules and precedents in art or not, is to me a matter of indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>I was true to my intuitions, and endeavored to adhere as faithfully as practicable to the facts. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It is not too much to say that the enthusiasm in which the work was conceived, flagged not to the end. The days were too short for labor upon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>It is true this was never exhibited in his public life, or addresses, but it was shown in his keen appreciation of <persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n0023.0036.00104.00355" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName>, and unrivalled faculty of story-telling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>I could not sleep, though I often tried to, when I got on such a hunt after an idea, until I had caught it; and when I thought I had got it, I was not satisfied until I had repeated it over and over, until I had put it in language plain enough, as I thought, for any boy I knew to comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>No man, no men, saw nature, fact, thing, or man from his stand-point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>His was a new and original position, which was always suggesting, hinting something to him. Nature, insinuations, hints, and suggestions were new, fresh, original, and odd to him. The world, fact, man, principle, all had their powers of suggestion to his susceptible soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>They continually put him in mind of something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>He was odd, fresh, new, original, and peculiar for this reason, that he was a new, odd, and original creation and fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>He had keen susceptibilities to the hints and suggestions of nature, which always put him in mind of something known or unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>Hence his power and tenacity of what is called association of ideas must have been great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/><pb id="p.330" n="330"/> His memory was tenacious and strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>His susceptibility to all suggestions and hints enabled him at will to call up readily the associated and classified fact and idea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>As an evidence of this, especially peculiar to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0080.00330.01364" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, let me ask <num value="1">one</num> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>Were <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0080.00330.01365" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s expression and language odd and original, standing out peculiar from those of all other men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>What does this imply?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>Oddity and originality of vision as well as expression; and what is expression in words and human language, but a telling of what we see, defining the idea arising from and created by vision and view in us. Words and language are but the counterparts of the idea,--the other half of the idea; they are but the stinging, hot, heavy, leaden bullets that drop from the mould; and what are they in a rifle with powder stuffed behind them and fire applied, but an embodied force pursuing their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>So are words an embodied power feeling for comprehension in other minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0080.00330.01366" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was often perplexed to give expression to his ideas: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because he was not master of the <rs>English</rs> language; and, secondly, because there were no words in it containing the coloring, shape, exactness, power, and gravity of his ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>He was frequently at a loss for a word, and hence was compelled to resort to stories, maxims, and jokes to embody his idea, that it might be comprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>So true was this peculiar mental vision of his, that though mankind has been gathering, arranging, and <pb id="p.331" n="331"/> classifying facts for <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0023.0080.00331.01367" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s peculiar stand-point could give him no advantage of other men's labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>Hence he tore up to the deep foundations all arrangements of facts, and coined and arranged new plans to govern himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>He was compelled, from his peculiar mental organization, to do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>His labor was great, continuous, patient, and all-enduring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>The truth about this whole matter is that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0080.00331.01368" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> read <hi rend="italics">less</hi> and thought <hi rend="italics">more</hi> than any man in his sphere in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>I repeat, that he read less and thought more than any man of his standing in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, if not in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/>He possessed originality and power of thought in an eminent degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>He was cautious, cool, concentrated, with continuity of reflection; was patient and enduring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>These are some of the grounds of his wonderful success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/>Not only was nature, man, fact, and principle suggestive to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0023.0080.00331.01371" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, not only had he accurate and exact perceptions, but he was causative, i.e., his mind ran back behind all facts, things, and principles to their origin, history, and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cause,--to that point where forces act at once as effect and <pb id="p.332" n="332"/> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/>He would stop and stand in the street and analyze a machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>He would whittle things to a point, and then count the numberless inclined planes, and their pitch, making the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>Mastering and defining this, he would then cut that point back, and get a broad transverse section of his pine stick, and peel and define that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>Clocks, omnibuses, and language, paddle-wheels, and idioms, never escaped his observation and analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>Before he could form any idea of anything, before he would express his opinion on any subject, he must know it in origin and history, in substance and quality, in magnitude and gravity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>He must know his subject inside and outside, upside and downside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>He searched his own mind and nature thoroughly, as I have often heard him say. He must analyze a sensation, an idea, and words, and run them back to their origin, history, purpose, and destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>He was most emphatically a remorseless analyzer of facts, things, and principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>When all these processes had been well and thoroughly gone through, he could form an opinion and express it, but no sooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>He had no faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/><quote>Say so's</quote> he had no respect for, coming though they might from tradition, power, or authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>All things, facts, and principles had to run through his crucible and be tested by the fires of his analytic mind; and hence, when he did speak his utterances rang out gold-like, quick, keen, and current upon the counters of the understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>He <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> reasoned logically, through analogy and comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>Knowing the <rs>President</rs> would soon appear, I stepped out under the portico to wait for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/><quote>Yes,</quote> said he, <quote>there are the war-maps, the portfolios, the slave-map, and all; but the book in the corner, leaning against the chair-leg,--you have changed the title of that, I see.</quote>
