<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>There is little to be said in addition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation of their approach was a telegram received at <time value="11am">11 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>At <time value="1am">1 A. M.</time>, another report informed me that enemy had encamped at that place, coming from <num value="3">three</num> different directions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I that night reinforced my picket of <num value="20">20</num> sharpshooters by <num value="40">40</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I regret to say that only about <num value="11">11</num> or <num value="12">12</num> of them got into the rifle pits in time for the attack of the enemy (owing to an unnecessary delay in carrying their horses to the rear), which commenced about <time value="5am">5 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I also ordered the remaining sharpshooters of the brigade, under that very efficient <persName n="Morgan,Officer-Major,,,," id="n0039.0002.00003.00023" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Officer-Major">officer Major</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">First Virginia</orgName>, to move from their camps by day-break to a <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> point on the railroad, where road turns to <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n0039.0002.00004.00024" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName>'s, <measure n="2mile" type="distance">2 mile</measure> from railroad bridge, and <hi rend="italics"></hi><num value="31">31</num> from <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n0039.0002.00004.00025" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName>'s, and the rest of the command was ordered to be in readiness to move at the shortest notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>At that time a force was reported to be at <placeName key="tgn,2110564" n="1.000 6" reg="bealeton, fauquier, virginia">Bealeton</placeName>, supposed to be their advance guard; and it was uncertain whether they would attempt to cross at <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n0039.0002.00004.00026" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName>'s, railroad bridge, or move on towards <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The report that enemy's attack was made at <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n0039.0002.00004.00027" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName>'s never reached me; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation I received from that point was at <time value="7:30am">7:30 A. M.</time>, to the effect that they had succeeded in crossing, capturing <num value="25">25</num> of my sharpshooters who were unable to reach their horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I moved my command at once down the railroad, taking up a position to await their approach, ordering my baggage-wagons and disabled horses to the rear towards <placeName reg="Rapidan station">Rapidan station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Some time elapsing and they not advancing, I determined to move upon them, and marched immediately for <persName n="Kelley,,,,," id="n0039.0002.00004.00028" reg="mostcommon:Kelley,nomatch:0"><surname>Kelley</surname></persName>'s. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> met the enemy half a mile this side of ford, and at once charged them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Their position was a very strong <num value="1">one</num>, sheltered by woods and a long, high stone fence running perpendicular to my advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>My men, unable to cross the fence and ditch in their front, wheeled about, delivering their fire almost in the faces of the enemy, and reformed again, facing about under a heavy fire from their artillery and small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>, in this charge, was in front, and <persName n="Carter,Lieutenant-1,Hill,,," id="n0039.0002.00004.00029" reg="default:Carter,Hill,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-1">First Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Hill</foreName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName> was very conspicuous in his behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>From that time it was a succession of gallant charges by the various regiments, and once by the whole brigade in line, whenever the enemy would show his mounted men; they invariably falling back upon his artillery and sheltered dismounted skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Their total advance was <measure n="2miles" type="distance">2 miles</measure> from the ford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At that time my artillery arrived, and they were driven back, recrossing the river about <time value="7:30pm">7:30 P. M.</time>, with us in close pursuit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>My whole command acted nobly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Sabres were frequently crossed, and fences charged up to, the leading men dismounting and pulling them down, under a heavy fire of canister, grape, and carbine balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><pb id="p.5" n="5"/> </p> 
<p>Had I my command in the order it arrived in this enervating section of country, and not weakened by the absence of <num value="4">four</num> squadrons on picket guarding a line stretching from Griffinsburg, on the <rs type="place">Sperryville turnpike</rs>, to <placeName reg="Richards' ford">Richards' ford</placeName>, and by the large numbers of horses unfit for duty by exposure to the severe winter with a very limited supply of forage, I feel confident that the defeat of the enemy would have been changed into a disorderly rout, and the whole brigade be supplied with horses, saddles, and bridles. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This corps, under its immortal leader, <persName n="Jackson,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00098" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, attacked the enemy on his right, turning his right flank by the turnpike road, at <persName n="Chancellor,,Melzie,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00099" reg="default:Chancellor,Melzie,,,"><foreName>Melzie</foreName> <surname>Chancellor</surname></persName>'s, <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> above <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName></placeName>, making the attack late in the evening, after an arduous and necessarily circuitous march from the plank road, <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> below <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The enemy had a fine position, and if time had been given him to recover from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> surprise and mass troops on that front, it would have been a difficult task to dislodge them; but <placeName reg="Jackson, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002268">Jackson</placeName>'s entire corps, both when marching and when in position, had been purposely screened from view by the cavalry of <persName n="Lee,,Fitzhugh,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00100" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><foreName n="Fitzhugh">Fitz.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName> &mdash; an important duty, which he performed with great skill and address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The attack was thus, in a measure, a surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The enemy's line of entrenchments was carried, and his legions driven in confusion from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It was already dark when I sought <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00101" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and proposed, as there appeared nothing else for me to do, to take some cavalry and infantry over and hold the <rs type="place">Ely's ford</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He approved the proposition, and I had already gained the heights overlooking the ford, where was a large number of camp fires, when <persName n="Adams,Captain,,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00102" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Hill,General,A.,P.,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00103" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s staff reached me post haste, and informed me of the sad calamities which for the time deprived the troops of the leadership of both <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00104" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00009.00105" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>, and the urgent demand for me to come and take command as quickly <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I rode with rapidity back <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, determined to press the pursuit already so gloriously begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I found that the enemy had made an attack on our right flank, but were repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The fact, however, that the attack was made, and at night, made me apprehensive of a repetition of it, and necessitated throwing back the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> so as to meet it. I was also informed that there was much confusion on the right, owing to the fact that some troops mistook friends for the enemy, and fired upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Knowing that an advance under such circumstances would be extremely hazardous, much against my inclination I felt bound to wait for daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0039.0003.00010.00117" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Stonewall,,,:5"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had also sent me word to use my own discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding-General</rs> was with the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> of the army, with which I had no communication, except by a very circuitous and uncertain route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I nevertheless sent a dispatch to inform him of the state of affairs, and rode around the lines, restoring order, imposing silence and making arrangements for the attack early next day. I sent <persName n="Alexander,Colonel,E.,P.,," id="n0039.0003.00010.00118" reg="default:Alexander,E.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> of artillery, to select and occupy with artillery, positions along the line bearing upon the enemy's position, with which duty he was engaged all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>At early dawn <orgName n="division"><persName n="Trimble,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00010.00119" reg="mostcommon:Trimble,nomatch:0"><surname>Trimble</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> composed the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line and <orgName n="division"><persName n="Rodes,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00010.00120" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,nomatch:0"><surname>Rodes</surname></persName>' division</orgName> the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The latter had his rations on the spot, and as his men were entirely without food, was extremely anxious to issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I was disposed to wait a short time for this purpose; but when, as preliminary to an attack, I ordered the right of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line to swing around and come perpendicular <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> to the road, the order was misunderstood for an order to attack, and that part of the line became engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I ordered the whole line to advance and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> lines to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>As the sun lifted the mist that shrouded the field, it was discovered that the ridge on the extreme right was a fine position for concentrating artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>I immediately ordered <num value="30">thirty</num> pieces to that point, and under the happy effects of the battalion system, it was done quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The effect of this fire upon the enemy's batteries was superb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>In the mean time the enemy was pressing our left with infantry, and all the reinforcements I could obtain were sent there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Urgent requests were sent for reinforcements, and notices that the troops were out of ammunition, &amp;c. I ordered that the ground must be held at all hazards; if necessary, with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>About this time, also, our right connected with <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00011.00125" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Patton,,,:2"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s left, relieving all anxiety on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I was now anxious to mass infantry on the left, to push the enemy there, and sent every available regiment to that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>About <time value="8am">8 o'clock A. M.</time>, the works of the enemy directly in front of our right were stormed; but the enemy's forces retiring from the line facing <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00011.00126" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Patton,,,:2"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, which our batteries enfiladed, caused our troops to abandon these works, the enemy coming in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It was stormed a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, when I discovered the enemy making a flank movement to the left of the road for the purpose of dislodging our forces, and hastened to change the front of a portion of our line to meet this attack; but the shortness of the time and the deafening roar of artillery prevented the execution of this movement, and our line again retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time it was taken I made disposition of a portion of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Ramseur,,,,," id="n0039.0003.00011.00127" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><surname>Ramseur</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> to protect the left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Artillery was pushed forward to the crest, sharpshooters were posted in a house in advance, and in a few <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> moments <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> was ours, (<time value="10am">10 o'clock, A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>In this hotly contested battle the enemy had strong works on each side of the road, those on the commanding ridge being heavily defended by artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The night, also, had given him time to mass his troops to meet this attack; but the desperate valor of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s corps overcame every obstacle, and drove the enemy to his new line of defence, which his engineers had constructed in his rear, ready for occupation, at the intersection of the <rs type="place">Ely's ford</rs> and <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ford roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>I set about reforming my command, with a view to a renewal of the attack, when the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding-General</rs> received intelligence that the enemy had crossed at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and taken <placeName reg="Marye's hill">Marye's hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The enemy had another work, <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> in rear of the other, which was also abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>This region of country is known as <quote>The Wilderness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Rapid pursuit in such a country is an impossibility, where the enemy takes care to leave his trains beyond the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, and avails himself, as he does, of the appliances of art, labor and natural obstacles, to delay his pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In this battle, in which the enemy's main force was attacked in chosen positions, he was driven entirely from the field, and finally fled across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>If you examine the map of that part of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and take into consideration the fact that the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, between the <num value="2">two</num> armies, and below, and for some distance above, could be crossed only on pontoon bridges; that from the nature of the ground we could not have forced the passage if we had the bridges, and that if we had undertaken to cross above, at some point where bridges were not necessary, we would have had to make a wide circuit and cross <num value="2">two</num> rivers, the iRapidan and <placeName reg="Dunavant, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2111530">Rappahannock</placeName>, you can understand the difficulties we would have had to encounter in making the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>Was the invasion a mistake?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>The proof of the pudding is the eating, and that test has certainly condemned it. I must also say frankly that my recollection is, that while the whole army went across the <rs>Potomac</rs> in the highest spirits, they were due more to confidence in <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01113" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> than to an entire accordance of all of the prominent officers in the wisdom of the invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>I remember conversations on the matter while on the march with <num value="1">one</num> of the most gallant major-generals of the army-<persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01114" reg="mostcommon:Hood,John,B.,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>--in which he suggested all of the very grave considerations against it which are so forcibly put by---- . <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01115" reg="nearbymention:Longstreet,J.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> has also stated to me since (although during the campaign I do not remember a word or sign from him indicating any doubt in its success) that he urged similar considerations, very earnestly, upon <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01116" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, when the campaign was being discussed, and was only persuaded out of them by the understanding that we were not to deliver an <hi rend="italics">offensive</hi> battle, but to so manoeuvre that <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01117" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> would be forced to attack us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Such a confidence on <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01119" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s part would probably not have been misplaced, for he carried the best and largest army into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> that he ever had in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The morale and spirit of the men was simply superb, as shown by the fight they made and the orderly and successful retreat after the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Whether he then fully appreciated all of the objections to it which can now be pointed out I do not know, but, even if he did, I can imagine his confidence in defeating the enemy in a decisive battle, by <hi rend="italics">forcing them to attack us</hi>, as so great, and as based on such reasonable grounds, as to fully justify the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>I fully agree as to the necessity to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00098.01121" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> of defeating the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and <hi rend="italics">perhaps</hi> that army would fight better on its own soil than in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and would, therefore, be <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> easier to defeat in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; but bear in mind that the <hi rend="italics">great</hi> condition <hi rend="italics">to assure</hi> its defeat was to force it to attack <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01122" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>Moreover, he did manoeuvre in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> inviting an attack, but in vain-at least he gave <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01123" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> opportunities which were not availed of, and no disposition shown to act on them during the few days they remained open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>It is also very certain that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01124" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> could never have established his army in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> with his communications open so as to get supplies, even of ammunition; but yet I think he could easily have so manoeuvred as to force <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01125" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> to attack him. A position covering <placeName reg="Fairfield, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7016248">Fairfield</placeName> would have given him the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> to support himself himself on, and would have been so threatening to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 9" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName> that <hi rend="italics">public clamor would have forced <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01126" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> to try and dislodge him</hi>. We had ammunition enough for <num value="1">one</num> good fight, and in a victory would capture enough for the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>If <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01127" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> at all, I don't think the crossing should necessarily have been dependent on a previous victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>A subsequent <num value="1">one</num> would have answered all purposes, and in all human probabilities it was nearly as certain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>They could have been forced to attack us, and they never had driven us from a field since the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Excellent positions also were to be found every where in that section, which was a lime-stone country, well cleared and abounding in long parallel ridges like the <rs type="place">Seminary ridge</rs> or <placeName reg="Cemetery Ridge, Wallowa, Oregon" key="tgn,2230296">Cemetery ridge</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>So much for the general plan of the campaign; and before proceeding to the next questions of ----, relating more to the incidents of the battle itself, it is in order to inquire why the original plan was changed and an offensive battle delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>And, on this subject, I know little or nothing that is not contained in <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01128" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>My general recollection is that we considered the enemy very slow in moving upon us, and took our time every where to give him opportunities to attack, if he desired, and that the concentration which was ordered at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> was intended as an offer of battle to him. In making this concentration <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01129" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> unexpectedly came in collision with <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01130" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName>' corps</orgName>, and the thing began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/><orgName n="corps"><persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01131" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName>' corps</orgName> was not expected there, and our information of the enemy's movements was incomplete on account of the absence of all of the cavalry, or nearly all, with <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00099.01132" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, who, instead of being between us and the enemy, was on <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> a raid around him. In this way the action began, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's success stimulated the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day's effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>This effort should have been successful, and would have been, but for delays and faults of detail in its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>These have been the subject of much crimination and recrimination among survivors as to the greater or less responsibility for them, but, to history, of course the general commanding is the responsible party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>I will write frankly all that I know about them personally further on. It is sufficient to say here that, as I have already implied, the battle was lost by them, and, in fact, under the conditions existing when the actual conflict was joined, success was <hi rend="italics">almost impossible</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>Even after the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day's battle, in my humble judgment, it was possible to have withdrawn from the offensive and taken the defensive, and forced <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00100.01133" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> to assault us, and to have given him a crushing defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>I may be mistaken, and I do not by any means set up as a military critic in general, but, as we did offer battle on the 4tb, and again for several days near <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>, on the retreat (while waiting to construct a bridge over the <rs>Potomac</rs>), and as <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00100.01134" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> did at last feel bound to attack us, but just a day too late to do it, I think a similar course might have been successfully pursued after the action of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>Whether it was discussed I do not know, but I do know that <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00100.01135" reg="nearbymention:Longstreet,J.,,,"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> was very averse to the assault by <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00100.01136" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>He only expressed his opinion about it, so far as I know, after the division was launched, but the circumstances which I will detail presently led me to infer that he had discussed the matter fully with <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00100.01137" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>And now I will give what details of the battle itself fell uDder my personal observation, which may assist in an understanding of the whole matter, and I will be very careful to give nothing unqualifiedly of which I am not personally certain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>This letter again placed the responsibility upon me, and I felt it very deeply, for the day was rapidly advancing (it was about <time value="12mid">12 M.</time>, or a little later), and whatever was to be done was to be done soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>This somewhat reassured me, as I had heard it said that morning that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0016.00105.01201" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had ordered <quote>every brigade in the army to charge <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName>,</quote> and it was at least certain that the question of supports had had his careful attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>I was convinced that to make <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> any half-way effort would insure a failure of the campaign, and that if our artillery fire was once opened, after all the time consumed in preparation for the attack, the only hope of success was to follow it up promptly with <num value="1">one</num> supreme effort, concentrating every energy we possessed into it, and my mind was fully made up that <hi rend="italics">if the artillery opened <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0039.0016.00106.01203" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName> must charge</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>You are correct in your assumption, that I failed to make a report of the operations of my division around <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk, Va.</placeName>, and of its action in the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs>, in consequence of a <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> wound which I received in this engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>In justice to the brave troops under my command at this period, I should here mention another cause for this apparent neglect of duty on my part.

This movement to the west soon resulted in the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>, where I was again so seriously wounded as to cause the loss of a limb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>These severe wounds in close successsion, in addition to the all-absorbing duties and anxieties attending the last year of the war, prevented me from submitting, subsequently, a report, as likewise <num value="1">one</num> after the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>, in which engagement-whilst you led the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>--I had the honor of commanding your corps, together with the <num value="3">three</num> divisions of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, respectively under <persName n="Stewart,,A.,P.,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01731" reg="default:Stewart,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnson,,Bushrod,,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01732" reg="default:Johnson,Bushrod,,,"><foreName>Bushrod</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Hindman,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01733" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><surname>Hindman</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>With this apology for seeming neglect, I will proceed to give a brief sketch from memory of the events forming the subject of your letter: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>My recollection of the circumstances connected with the attempt, whilst we were lying in front of <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>, to reach <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01734" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in time to participate in the <rs n="Battle of Chancellorsville" type="battle">battle of Chancellorsville</rs> is very clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>The order directing your corps to move to the support of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01735" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was received about the time <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01736" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> crossed the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Unfortunately, we had been compelled by the scarcity of forage to send off our wagons into <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> to gather a supply from that state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>A short delay necessarily ensued, as couriers had to be dispatched for the requisite transportation before the troops could move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>Every effort, however, was made to get to <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00146.01737" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> at the earliest moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>If my memory betrays me not, you repaired in advance of your corps to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, having issued orders for us to march with all possible speed to <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> Lee on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>I was most anxious to get to the support of my old chief, and made strenuous efforts to do so; but, whilst on a forced march to accomplish this object, I received intelligence of our victory at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, and of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s mortal wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>We, nevertheless, continued our march, and eventually went into bivouac upon the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, near <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>After the <rs n="Battle of Chancellorsville" type="battle">battle of Chancellorsville</rs>, preparations were made for an offensive campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Accordingly, my troops moved out of camp, crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs> about the <dateStruct value="1863-06-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month>, <year>1863</year>,</dateStruct> and joined in the general move in the direction of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>We crossed the river about the middle of the same month, and marched into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>Whilst lying in camp, not far distant from <placeName key="tgn,2087107" n="1.000 167" reg="chambersburg, franklin, pennsylvania">Chambersburg</placeName>, information was received that <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00147.01740" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,Generell,,,:1"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00147.01741" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName> were about to come in contact with the enemy near <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>My troops, together with <orgName n="division"><persName n="McLaws,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00147.01742" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><surname>McLaws</surname></persName>' division</orgName>, were put in motion upon the most direct road to that point, which, after a hard march, we reached before or at sunrise on the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>So imperative had been the orders to hasten forward with all possible speed, that on the march my troops were allowed to halt and rest only about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, during the night from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> to the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>I arrived with my staff in front of the heights of <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> shortly after daybreak, as I have already stated, on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-07-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>My division soon commenced filing into an open field near me, where the troops were allowed to stack arms and rest until further orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>A short distance in advance of this point, and during the early part of that same morning, we were both engaged, in company with <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0019.00147.01743" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hill,General,A.,P.,," id="n0039.0019.00147.01744" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, in observing the position of the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>He seemed full of hope, yet at times, buried in deep thought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/><persName n="Fremantle,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0019.00147.01746" reg="mostcommon:Fremantle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Fremantle</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, was ensconced in the forks of a tree not far off, with glass in constant use, examining the lofty position of the <rs>Federal</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>He remarked to me: <quote>The enemy is here, and if we do not whip him he will whip us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>You thought it better to await the arrival of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00148.01748" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>-at that time still in the rearin order to make the attack; and you said to me, subsequently, whilst we were seated together near the trunk of a tree: <quote>The General is a little nervous this morning; he wishes me to attack; I do not wish to do so without <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00148.01749" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>I never like to go into battle with <num value="1">one</num> boot off.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/></p> 
<p>Thus passed the forenoon of that eventful day, when, in the afternoon &mdash; about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>--it was decided to no longer await <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00148.01750" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, but to proceed to our extreme right, and attack up the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/><persName n="McLaws,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00148.01751" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><surname>McLaws</surname></persName> moved off, and I followed with my division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>In a short time I was ordered to quicken the march of my troops, and pass to the front of <persName n="McLaws,,,,," id="n0039.0019.00148.01752" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><surname>McLaws</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>This movement was accomplished by throwing out an advanced force to tear down fences and clear the way. The instructions I received were to place my division across the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road, form line of battle, and attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>Before reaching this road, however, I had sent forward some of my picked <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> scouts to ascertain the position of the enemy's extreme left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>They soon reported to me that it rested upon <placeName key="possibilities=34" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Round Top mountain</placeName>; that the country was open and that I could march through an open woodland pasture around <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0039.0019.00148.01753" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName> and assault the enemy in flank and rear; that their wagon trains were parked in rear of their line, and were badly exposed to our attack in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>As soon as I arrived upon the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road I placed <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> batteries in position and opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>A reply from the enemy's guns soon developed his lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>His left rested on or near <placeName key="possibilities=118" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Round Top</placeName>, with line bending back and again forward, forming, as it were, a concave line as approached by the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>A considerable body of troops was posted in front of their main line, between the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road and <placeName key="possibilities=34" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Round Top mountain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>This force was in line of battle upon an eminence near a peach orchard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>I found, that in making the attack according to orders, viz: up the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road, I should have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to encounter and drive off this advanced line of battle; secondly, at the base and along the slope of the mountain, to confront immense boulders of stone, so massed together as to form narrow openings, which would <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> break our ranks and cause the men to scatter whilst climbing up the rocky precipice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>I found, moreover, that my division would be exposed to a heavy fire from the main line of the enemy, in position on the crest of the high range, of which <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0039.0019.00149.01754" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName> was the extreme left, and, by reason of the concavity of the enemy's main line, that we would be subject to a destructive fire in flank and rear, as well as in front; and deemed it almost an impossibility to clamber along the boulders up this steep and rugged mountain, and, under this number of cross-fires, put the enemy to flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>I knew that if the feat was accomplished it must be at a most fearful sacrifice of as brave and gallant soldiers as ever engaged in battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>The reconnoissance by my <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> scouts and the development of the <rs>Federal</rs> lines were effected in a very short space of time; in truth, shorter than I have taken to recall and jot down these facts, although the scenes and events of that day are as clear to my mind as if the great battle had been fought yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>I was in possession of these important facts so shortly after reaching the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road, that I considered it my duty to report to you at once my opinion, that it was unwise to attack up the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road, as ordered, and to urge that you allow me to turn <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0039.0019.00149.01755" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName> and attack the enemy in flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>Accordingly, <num value="1">1</num> dispatched a staff officer bearing to you my request to be allowed to make the proposed movement on account of the above-stated reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Your reply was quickly received: <quote><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0019.00149.01756" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s orders are to attack up the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>I sent another officer to say that I feared nothing could be accomplished by such an attack, and renewed my request to turn <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0039.0019.00149.01757" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName>. Again your answer was: <quote><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0019.00149.01758" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s orders are to attack up the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>During this interim I had continued the use of the batteries upon the enemy, and had become more and more convinced that the <rs>Federal</rs> line extended to <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0039.0019.00149.01759" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName>, and that I could not reasonably hope to accomplish much by the attack as ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>In fact, it seemed to me the enemy occupied a position by nature so strong &mdash; I may say impregnable-that, independently of their flank-fire, they could easily repel our attack by merely throwing and rolling stones down the mountain side as we approached. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> time I dispatched <num value="1">one</num> of my staff to explain fully in regard to the situation, and to suggest that you had better come <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> and look for yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>I selected, in this instance, my adjutantgeneral, <persName n="Sellers,Colonel,Harry,,," id="n0039.0019.00150.01760" reg="default:Sellers,Harry,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName> <surname>Sellers</surname></persName>, whom you know to be not only an officer of great courage, but also of marked ability.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>As my troops were moving forward, you rode up in person; a brief conversation passed between us, during which I again expressed the fears above mentioned, and regret at not being allowed to attack in flank around <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0039.0019.00150.01764" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>I then rode forward with my line under a heavy fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Some of the reasons substantiating this view I shall answer hereafter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>About <num value="2">2</num> or <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P.

In order to get to the place they assigned me, in the rear of General Law, it was necessary to move the brigade <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> further to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Having done this, I advanced in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>A wood intervened between us and the enemy, which, ~though it did not prevent their shells from reaching us and producing <pb id="p.168" n="168"/> some casualties, yet completely hid them from our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>On emerging from the woods their position became visible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Before us, at the distance of <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure>, was an oblong mountain peak or spur, presenting to us a steep face much roughened by rocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>To the right, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> from the peak, was the main mountain itself, with a side that looked almost perpendicular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Its summit overlooked the peak just sufficiently to command it well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>On the summit of the peak were <num value="3">three</num> pieces of artillery, and a little in advance of them, on a sort of uneven, irregular shelf, were <num value="3">three</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>To the right and left of the battery, as well as immediately in its rear, were lines of infantry, as we afterwards ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>This formed the enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>On the top of the mountain itself, and a little to the right of the peak, were <num value="5">five</num> other guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>These commanded our approaches to the peak for nearly the whole way. To the right and left of these guns extended the enemy's <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>Where that line crossed the gorge running between the peak and the mountain, a point <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> in the rear of the peak, were <num value="2">two</num> other guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>This we ascertained when the right of the brigade reached the gorge by the terrible fire from them which swept down the gorge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>Thus what we had to encounter were <num value="13">thirteen</num> guns and <num value="2">two</num>, if not more, lines of infantry posted on mountain heights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>The intervening spur, over which we had to march to reach the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> linewas nearly all open. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>Our own <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line also became visible advancing about <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>The part of it in our front I took to be <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00168.01956" reg="nearbymention:Law,E.,M.,,"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, and so I followed it. In truth it was <persName n="Robertson,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00168.01957" reg="nearbymention:Robertson,J.,B.,,"><surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00168.01958" reg="nearbymention:Law,E.,M.,,"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s being farther to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>This I did not discover until late in the fight, a wood on the right concealing from me most of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Law,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00168.01959" reg="nearbymention:Law,E.,M.,,"><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>My line continued to follow the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, halting once or twice to preserve its interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>At length I saw that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>not be able alone to carry the peak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>So I advanced without halting again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>When my line reached the foot of the peak, I found there a part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX1">First Texas</orgName> struggling to make the ascentthe rest of the brigade having gone to the right and left-the <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName> to the right and the <orgName type="regiment" key="AR3">Third Arkansas</orgName> tothe left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>The part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX1">First Texas</orgName> referred to falling in with <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> my brigade, the whole line commenced ascending the rugged steep and (on the right) crossing the gorge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>The ground was difficult-rocks in many places, presenting by their precipitous sides, insurmountable obstacles, whilst the fire of the enemy was very heavy and very deadly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>The progress was, therefore, not very rapid, but it was regular and uninterrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>After awhile the enemy were driven from their <num value="3">three</num> front guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>The advance continued, and at length they were driven completely from the peak, but they carried with them the <num value="3">three</num> rear guns on its summit, its sudden descent on the other side favoring the operation; so that we captured only the <num value="3">three</num> front guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>These were tenpounder Parrots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>A number of prisoners also were taken, more I suppose than <num value="100">one hundred</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>The peak being thus taken and the enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line driven behind his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, I made my dispositions to hold the ground gained, which was all that I could do, as I was then much in advance of every other part of our line of battle, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of the enemy on the mountain itself was in a position which seemed to me almost impregnable to any merely front attack, even with fresh men. Indeed, to hold the ground we had appeared a difficult task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/>The shells of the enemy from the adjacent mountain were incessantly bursting along the summit of the peak, and every head that showed itself was the target for a Minnie ball. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/>Several attempts by flank movements were made to dislodge us, but by the gallantry of the regiments on the right and left they all failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>We held the position until late next day, when we were ordered back to the crest of the wooded hill from which we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw the enemy on the day before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>Our loss was heavy, not less than <num value="400">four hundred</num> in killed, wounded, and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>Of this number, an unusually large proportion were killed and badly wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>Among the killed were <persName n="Jones,Colonel,John,A.,," id="n0039.0022.00169.01960" reg="default:Jones,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA20">Twentieth Georgia</orgName>, and <persName n="Harris,Lieutenant-Colonel,William,T.,," id="n0039.0022.00169.01961" reg="default:Harris,William,T.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>, commanding the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA2">Second Georgia</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1939"/>After the enemy's forces were driven from the position and they had themselves opened upon it with shell from their other batteries, a fragment of <num value="1">one</num> of which, glancing from a rock, passed through his brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1940"/>He had behaved with great coolness and gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1941"/>He fell just as success came in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> <persName n="Harris,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01963" reg="nearbymention:Harris,William,T.,,"><surname>Harris</surname></persName> was further to the right, where he and his regiment were exposed to the terrible fire of the <num value="2">two</num> pieces, which swept the gorge, as well as to the infantry fire of the enemy's left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>A ball passed through the heart, killing him instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>His gallantry had been most conspicuous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>I had no means of ascertaining the precise loss of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>In killed and wounded it must have been large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>Dead and wounded lay scattered over the ground of the conflict and of the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>From the latter they were removed by the enemy during the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>We took about <measure n="300" type="prisoners">three hundred prisoners</measure> in all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>The conduct of both officers and men was generally, as far as I could observe it, excellent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>Under a fire from so many cannon, and towards the last from so much musketry, they advanced steadly over ground for the most part open, mounted a difficult height, drove back from it the enemy, occupied his line, took <num value="3">three</num> guns, captured a number of prisoners, and, against his utmost efforts, held all they had gained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>The captured guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>were taken by the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA20">Twentieth Georgia</orgName> (<persName n="Colo,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01964" reg="mostcommon:Colo,nomatch:0"><surname>Colo</surname></persName>-<persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01965" reg="nearbymention:Jones,John,A.,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, and after his death, <persName n="Waddell,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01966" reg="mostcommon:Waddell,J.,F.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Waddell</surname></persName>), the part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX1">First Texas</orgName> above referred to (<persName n="Work,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01967" reg="mostcommon:Work,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Work</surname></persName>), and the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA17">Seventeenth Georgia</orgName> (<persName n="IHodges,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01968" reg="mostcommon:IHodges,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>IHodges</surname></persName>), but the honor of the capture was not exclusively theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>They could not have taken, certainly could not have held the guns, if <persName n="Harris,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01969" reg="nearbymention:Harris,William,T.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>, and after his death, <persName n="Shepherd,Major,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01970" reg="mostcommon:Shepherd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Shepherd</surname></persName>, on the left with the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA2">Second Georgia</orgName>, and <persName n="DuBose,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00170.01971" reg="mostcommon:DuBose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>DuBose</surname></persName>, with the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA15">Fifteenth Georgia</orgName>, on the right, had not by the hardest kind of fighting and at great loss protected their flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>They performed well duties that kept them in almost constant danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>The former having been disabled by a wound the whole weight of staff duty towards the end of the fight fell upon the <num value="2">two</num> latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>At the close of the day the fighting ceased, and I employed the night in arranging my line, establishing pickets, and removing the <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>The last was a work of great labor, as owiiig to some fault or mistake in the surgeon having charge of the brigade ambulances, but <num value="2">two</num> of them made their appearance, so that the labor to the litter-bearers became very heavy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>The enemy employed the whole night in throwing up <num value="2">two</num> lines of breastworks, <num value="1">one</num> above the other, on the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>These works were formed from the loose stones which abounded on the surface of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>The sound of the stones dropping into place could be distinctly heard from our line during the whole night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>The morning light revealed the <num value="2">two</num> long lines completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>The upper line was sufficiently above the lower for its fire to pass over the lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>The crest was still frowning with its old line greatly strengthened since the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>From this line the fire of both artillery and infantry would pass over both of the lines below. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>Until late in the afternoon nothing occurred more important than picket firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>About <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time>, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> pickets of <orgName n="Mc-Laws' Division"><persName n="Mc-Laws,Division,,,," id="n0039.0022.00171.01976" reg="mostcommon:Mc-Laws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Division"></roleName><surname>Mc-Laws</surname></persName>' <orgName n="division">division</orgName></orgName> came to me and told me that the troops of <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00171.01977" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName> had for some hours been withdrawn from my left, leaving my flank entirely exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notice I had of that movement, so important to my brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>I immediately ordered the strongest picket force I could spare to the abandoned post of <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00171.01978" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName>' line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Shortly afterwards a courier from General Law came to me and told me that General Law wished me to move to the crest of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>I asked him what crest-what hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>He said all he knew was that General Law waved his hand thus (making a wave of his hand). I was much at a loss to know what the wave meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>It seemed to me, however, to be in the direction of a ridge that ran through the woods towards the ground from which <persName n="McLaws,,,,," id="n0039.0022.00171.01979" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><surname>McLaws</surname></persName>' troops had been withdrawn, and I concluded that the object of the order was to cause me to occupy that ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>Consequently, I immediately gave <persName n="DuBose,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00171.01980" reg="mostcommon:DuBose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>DuBose</surname></persName> orders to take his regiment along the crest to that ground, his regiment being most convenient at the beginning of the crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>He moved off at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>In a few minutes afterwards I received what was the same order from General Law, but this time clearly and in a very different sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>It was to move back immediately to the crest of the hill from which we had advanced the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>I gave the necessary orders and the <num value="3">three</num> regiments remaining in <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> position commenced moving out. A little afterwards I heard a heavy infantry fire on the left, in the direction in which <persName n="DuBose,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00172.01981" reg="mostcommon:DuBose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>DuBose</surname></persName> had gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>Subsequently, I learned from him that after following the ridge for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure>, he suddenly found himself in the immediate presence of <num value="2">two</num> long lines of the enemy, <num value="1">one</num> almost at right angles to the other, with his own line between the <num value="2">two</num>, the head of it being not far from the angle they made with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>They opened fire on him, which he returned so as to check their advance a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>He then fell back, and availing himself of a stone fence, fought his way out, not however, without a heavy loss in prisoners, and some loss in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>He was fortunate to escape at all. His escape is high evidence both of his skill and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>I did not go to his assistance because when I heard the fire it seemed to be, and was indeed, so far on my left, that I thought some of <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00172.01982" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McLaws</surname></persName>' men had been sent forward to check an advance of the enemy, and that it came from a collision between them and the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>My brigade was stretched across the road (relieving a portion of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Corse,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00172.01983" reg="mostcommon:Corse,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Corse</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>), on a ridge parallel with the <rs type="place">Gap</rs>, <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> and such dispositions were made by General Law on my flanks with the other brigades, that the enemy's pickets soon fell back a mile or more, and his reserve regiments quite to the <rs type="place">Gap</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>So I remained, but it was <time value="9am">9 o'clock A. M.</time> before I was relieved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>I then started to overtake the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>To get by these wagons and the artillery in the mountain road was a work of no small difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>It was near night before I could do it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>I accepted his services, and he advanced beyond the crossing of the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/>Very soon his skirmishers were engaged with those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>After some time, as I heard and saw nothing but skirmishing, I concluded to move on, <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00173.01992" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> sending me word that he would relieve <persName n="Oates,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00173.01993" reg="mostcommon:Oates,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Oates</surname></persName> and let him follow me. After <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> moving on less than half a mile a shell, much to my surprise, passed over my line, and then others in rapid succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>They had been fired by the enemy at our skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>My line was concealed from the enemy by an intervening hill and the cut of the road, so <num value="1">1</num> continued to move on unharmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>When I had almost reached the ford of <placeName reg="Hazel, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124592">Hazel river</placeName> I recieved a request from <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.01994" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> to wait for his artillery and let it follow me. I accordingly halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>After waiting for some time there came to me, instead of artillery, another message from <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.01995" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> to the effect that it was necessary to drive the enemy back from their position in the mountain, and that he wished me to move my command on their flank and rear to the road by which they had come, and thus cut off their retreat, and to do this bly a route which the bearer of the message, <persName n="Stannard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.01996" reg="mostcommon:Stannard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Stannard</surname></persName>, would show me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>The request seemed reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>The enemy had evidently got artillery into a mountain position, difficult to be carried by a front attack, from which position they commanded the road at several points, including, I think, the ford, and thus, unless dislodged, could greatly annoy troops and trains passing by, if not stop their progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>My command was the <num value="1">one</num> most conveniently situated to execute the suggested movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>I thought it right, therefore, to accede to <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.01997" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s request. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>Signifying this to <persName n="Stannard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.01998" reg="mostcommon:Stannard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Stannard</surname></persName>, he went forward as guide, and I followed him with the brigade and the <orgName type="regiment" key="4ALRegiment">4th Alabama regiment</orgName>, <persName n="Scruggs,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.01999" reg="mostcommon:Scruggs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Scruggs</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>The route was so well chosen that we passed through the enemy's picket line and got near enough to the road in their rear to command it before they discovered us. Before fire was opened, <persName n="Newell,Captain,,,," id="n0039.0022.00174.02000" reg="mostcommon:Newell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Newell</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="GA2">Second Georgia</orgName>, commanding the skirmishers, reported to me a battery considerably on my right, just across the road in a field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>I moved to the right in the woods to get near it and seize it before it could run back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>The wood was thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>I got the right of the brigade opposite the battery, and then ordered an advance in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>When the line emerged from the wood the battery was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>It had run back the way it came, having found out our presence by the fire which had opened between their skirmishers and ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>Our line fired upon such of the enemy as were in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>Those of the latter who were not disabled fled in confusion to the opposite wood, where, on the left, was another battery, as I had <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> just learned by its fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/>The road I found, when the line reached it, a good place for protection against this battery, and also for assailing the cavalry on their expected retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>I therefore halted in it. I now thought we had their cannon and cavalry secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>I had been assured by <persName n="Stannard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0039.0022.00175.02001" reg="mostcommon:Stannard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Stannard</surname></persName>, as well as by citizens, that there was no practicable way to <placeName key="tgn,2110322" n="1.000 4" reg="amissville, rappahannock, virginia">Amissville</placeName>, except this road occupied by the brigade, all others being excluded by the mountain and its spurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>They were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>The enemy found another road nearer to the mountain, and by it escaped with their artillery and most of their cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>We took a few of them prisoners, and killed and wounded more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>As soon as it was clear that the enemy had retreated, at the suggestion of <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0039.0022.00175.02002" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, I returned to the ford and resumed the march, the command having spent <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, marched at least <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> over very difficult ground and fought a brisk fight with cavalry and artillery in the detour. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Such was the part contributed by the brigade and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="AL15">Fifteenth Alabama</orgName> to the defeat of a well-laid plan of the enemy, organized on rather a large scale, to impede the march and cut off the trains of a large part of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>They must have had <num value="2">two</num>, if not <num value="3">three</num> brigades of cavalry, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> batteries of artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>This, <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, is a much longer report than I would have had it to be, but, under the order requiring it, I do not see how it could have been shorter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>Indeed, I have omitted some things, showing the arduousness of the long march, which are perhaps called for by the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>I must, in closing, ask leave to pay a tribute to the merit of the brigade in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>There was no straggling to speak of, either on the advance or the return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>The rolls when we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> showed almost the same number which they showed when we left <placeName reg="Culpeper Courthouse">Culpeper Courthouse</placeName>.

<p>At <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> the behavior of the brigade was magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>By <hi rend="italics">deliberate</hi> and <hi rend="italics">protracted</hi> fighting it ascended the mountain, took the enemy's line, about <measure n="300" type="prisoners">three hundred prisoners</measure>, and <num value="3">three</num> of his <num value="6">six</num> guns in position there, and held its ground until next afternoon late, when it was ordered to fall back by General Law, commanding the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>I was told that this was the only part of the enemy's line carried and <hi rend="italics">held</hi>, and these the only guns captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>Indeed, the brigade believes and boasts that these were the only guns ever taken by any part of our army north of the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>On the next evening I mistook an order, thinking it was an order to advance when it was <num value="1">one</num> to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>In consequence, I sent <persName n="DuBose,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0023.00176.02006" reg="mostcommon:DuBose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>DuBose</surname></persName> with the <num value="15" type="ordinal">Fifteenth</num> to my left and front to occupy a line which had been occupied by some of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Mc-Laws,General,,,," id="n0039.0023.00176.02007" reg="mostcommon:Mc-Laws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mc-Laws</surname></persName>' division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>(They had been withdrawn for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>.) He had to retreat, and in doing so lost about <num value="100">one hundred</num> men, mostly prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>I must mention a thing that I forgot to put in my report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>When my mistake as to the meaning of General Law's order was corrected, and I found it to be an order to retreat, a good deal of time had been lost, the troops on the right and left had been withdrawn, and the enemy were advancing on both flanks, and had nearly got to our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>I dispatched couriers in a run to regimental commanders to send me their colors immediately, and retreat in all haste and without any regard to order, and to form again where they should see their colors planted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>The colorbearers were directed to run about <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> to a position somewhat sheltered and plant their colors in line at regimental distance as nearly as they could judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/>They did so. The brigade followed after as fast as men and officers could run, a confused mass; but when the colors were planted every man and every officer rushed to his own place in the line, and the line was formed in, I think, <num value="1">one</num> minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Then the brigade marched back in perfect order to the place assigned to it. The loss in the operation <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> was about <num value="20">twenty</num> men, and most of these were pickets, to whom the order to retreat had not been communicated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>The brigade at <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> had <num value="1280">1,280</num> men and <num value="140">140</num> officers, according to my recollection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>On the last day's fight, about <time value="2pm">2 P. M.</time>, we heard from the mountain we had taken the day before a great shouting in our rear down the <placeName reg="Emmettsburg">Emmettsburg</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>We soon distinguished it to be the enemy's cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/>Very soon the head of a line of his cavalry in that road emerged from the wood, galloping, hurrahing and waving their swords as if frantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2063"/>Our artillery, which had been thrown forward across the road, opened on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2064"/>They rode on. An infantry fire from a wood on their left opened on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2065"/>They then turned to their right to escape, taking down a lane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>Some men of ours (cooking details) threw themselves behind the stone fence on the side of the lane and opened on them as they came down the lane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>Dear Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter of <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>Upon its receipt I immediately appointed energetic agents to collect laborers in this and adjoining counties to construct the fortifications near <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, but I must say that the response to my appeal for laborers has not thus far been as flattering as I had wanted and expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2194"/><num value="1">1</num> shall have within a very few days some <num value="200">200</num> negro men at this work, and hope soon to increase this number to <num value="500">500</num> or <num value="600">600</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>Telegraphed you the same day your letter came to hand, asking how many laborers you thought necessary, about what length of time they would be employed, and what engineer would supervise and control the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>Answers to which would have aided me in securing the laborers, but have as yet received no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>I fully appreciate the exigencies by which you are, surrounded, and, as I have heretofore, I shall continue to use every effort within my power, and all resources at my command to strengthen your position and to secure the country from invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>In order, however, that the present resources of the <rs>State</rs> may not be overestimated, it is proper that I give you at least an approximate idea of them and some of the difficulties which I encounter at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/><placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> has now organized and in the field, in addition to some independent companies, <num value="52">52</num> infantry regiments and <num value="1">one</num> battalion, <num value="9">nine</num> battalions of cavalry, and <num value="2">two</num> regiments of artillery; volunteer companies are now in camp, under orders to move to rendezvous, sufficient to form <num value="6">six</num> additional infantry regiments and <num value="2">two</num> battalions of cavalry, making the whole force about <num value="66">sixty-six</num> regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>This force, large as it is, is drawn almost entirely from <num value="2">two</num> divisions of the <rs>State</rs>, the unfortunate political dissensions in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, with near <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the voting population of the <rs>State</rs>, having almost paralyzed that section, but I am pleased to state that these divisions and dissensions are rapidly disappearing, and I hope soon to see a united people in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, when we may reasonably expect reinforcements from that section; but, with the immense tax upon the population of <rs type="direction">Middle</rs> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">West</rs> Tennessee</placeName> to make up the force already referred to, I do not hope for any considerable number of volunteers from either of these divisions, unless it be upon pressing emergency, when I fell assured that a patriotic response will be made by almost our whole people to meet such emergency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>But the difficulty is not, nor has it been, in obtaining men. The inadequate supply of arms has been and is the chief obstacle which I encounter in promptly furnishing to you any reasonable number of reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>With the greatest possible energy it takes time to collect and repair the private arms of the country, and this is the only means I have of arming the force now called to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>I have spared neither effort, pains or expense in expediting the work, and yet it has been, and is, impossible to proceed with it rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>In furnishing arms to the large force above referred to, the <rs>State</rs> has heretofore drawn from the hands of her citizens their most effective private arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>Almost every gun that we get at this time must necessarily pass through the hands of the smiths before it is fit for service; and in this connection it is well to remark that <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, less fortunate than some of her sister States, had no <orgName n="U. S. Arsenal" type="org">United States arsenal</orgName> or depository of arms within her limits from which her troops might have been supplied; that but comparatively a small number of her force have been armed independent of the <rs>State</rs>, and that upon assuming connexion with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> all of her contracts for the manufacture of arms and other materials of war were assigned and transferred to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>I am sure, General, you will appreciate and make due allowance for the difficulties that lie in my way in the work of arming the forces of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> under these circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>I trust I shall be able with the inferior arms of the country to arm the volunteers now in, and that many will hereafter come into camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>The order was given and the troops moved forward deliberately and with resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>The enemy's line of skirmishers was pushed back upon his main line at the top of the ridge before alluded to, and our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line was soon under a heavy fire from his breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>There was but little cover for our assaulting lines, and the ascent in some places was moderately steep, but not rugged, affording the enemy great advantages in the ground, in addition to those derived from his breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>The troops, however, moved forward with a spirit and determination that threatened, in spite of all odds, to crown the hill and drive the enemy from his place-Slowly, but resolutely, they advanced up the ascent, to within pistol shot of the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>At this point, under a deadly fire, a few wavered and the rest laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>The line was unbroken, and, although the position was a trying <num value="1">one</num>, every inch of ground gained was resolutely maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>A staff officer was sent to request the reserve line to be pushed forward without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>After waiting sometime for the reserves to come upperhaps not so long as it appeared to those exposed to this deadly fire at such close range-another staff officer was sent back with an urgent appeal for them to be brought up immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>In the meantime, both men and officers in the front line were suffering severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>Each moment brought death and wounds into their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>On every part of the line officers were constantly falling, while engaged in encouraging and urging the men to remain firm until assistance should arrive, and, by their conduct, setting examples of heroism and courage seldom equalled, and still more rarely surpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line came up in rear of <persName n="Deas,,,,," id="n0039.0028.00200.02205" reg="mostcommon:Deas,H.,B.,,:1"><surname>Deas</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brantley,,,,," id="n0039.0028.00200.02206" reg="mostcommon:Brantley,nomatch:0"><surname>Brantley</surname></persName>, but <hi rend="italics">the</hi> ranks of the latter had been so thinned by the fire to which they had been exposed that the <num value="2">two</num> lines combined were unable to make any further advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>Unwilling to abandon the attack while a reasonable hope of success remained, and believing that, with the assistance of a couple of good brigades, the enemy's left could be forced back, a staff officer was sent to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0028.00200.02207" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to ascertain if the necessary assistance could be spared from other portions of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>In the meantime, every effort was made to hold the ground already gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>Stragglers were pushed up to the front and the slightly wounded were encouraged to remain there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>(While engaged in these efforts, a color-bearer <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> was discovered some short distance behind the front line, with a number of men scattered about through the pines near him.

The officers of the regiment were then called for, but none responded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>The color-bearer expressed great desire to carry the colors forward, and, upon my directing him to do so, he did advance them gallantly, calling upon his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>I regret to say that but few responded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>When the conduct of officers or troops justifies it, I deem it to be a duty no less imperative to censure than to praise; and it is under a sense of this duty that I relate this circumstance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>I would not be understood as imputing reprehensible conduct to the whole regiment, whose color-bearer I have alluded to, for I know that on other fields that regiment has acquitted itself with the highest honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>But I do say, that if the men in question did belong to the <orgName type="regiment" key="13LARegiment">Thirteenth Louisiana regiment</orgName>, as represented to. me, they are unworthy comrades of a gallant color-bearer, and that they reflect discredit upon a gallant regiment from as gallant a State as shines in the <rs>Southern</rs> constellation.) </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>Regarding the extreme right of my line as in great danger, and desiring to hold our position there until assistance might arrive, I now proceeded along the line from <persName n="Brantley,,,,," id="n0039.0028.00201.02208" reg="mostcommon:Brantley,nomatch:0"><surname>Brantley</surname></persName>'s right towards <persName n="Sharp,,,,," id="n0039.0028.00201.02209" reg="mostcommon:Sharp,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharp</surname></persName>'s position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>At this time the troops of the front line Were lying down within <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> of the enemy's breastworks, and, at many points, much nearer, keeping up a hot fire upon every thing that appeared above the defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>From these defences the enemy, too, poured an unremitting fire upon the assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>Of the report of the commissioners (I have the <hi rend="italics">original</hi> in my possession). </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>I think you will see, by comparing my draft and your amendment, the cause of <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0030.00212.02307" reg="nearbymention:Hunter,R.,M.,T.,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s statement, which is partially but not entirely accurate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>The instructions were, if my memory does not betray me, discussed in the presence of <num value="1">one</num> or more of the commissioners; but, however that may be, my idea was to make them as vague and <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> general as possible, so as to get at the views and sentiments of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0030.00213.02308" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and to test the reality of the peace intentions represented by <persName n="Blair,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0030.00213.02309" reg="nearbymention:Blair,F.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName> to actuate him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>You thought, from regard to your personal honor, that your language ought to be such as to render impossible any malignant comment on your actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>I did not anticipate the possibility of such a perversion of your motives, and was anxious to keep out of view any topic that might defeat the object of the proposed conference, but <hi rend="italics">not</hi> at the risk of any assault on your character or honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>The following day I disposed these troops for this purpose, and early the next morning the enemy moved in force on the <placeName reg="Durant, Angelina, Texas" key="tgn,2301702">Durant</placeName> road, towards <placeName reg="Sibley's Mills">Sibley's Mills</placeName>, about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> to the east, beyond <placeName key="tgn,2005345" n="1.000 21" reg="spanish fort, baldwin, alabama">Spanish Fort</placeName>, in the direction of <placeName reg="Blakeley, Baldwin, Alabama" key="tgn,2179274">Blakely</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>I had selected a line of battle on the north side of <placeName reg="D'Olive Creek, Baldwin, Alabama" key="tgn,2273743">D'Olive Creek</placeName>, intending to dispute its passage and develop him, having already thrown my small cavalry force upon his flanks with orders to harrass him. At this point the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> commanding District of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> came up to offer battle with his whole force; but in consequence of the rapid movement of the enemy to our left and rear, as above indicated, the larger portion of the troops were ordered to <placeName reg="Blakeley, Baldwin, Alabama" key="tgn,2179274">Blakely</placeName> under <persName n="Liddell,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0039.0031.00215.02333" reg="nearbymention:Liddell,St.,John,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Liddell</surname></persName>, and my instructions were to assume immediate command of the defences of <placeName key="tgn,2005345" n="1.000 21" reg="spanish fort, baldwin, alabama">Spanish Fort</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>Upon examination I discovered the line of defence to be about <measure n="3500yards" type="distance">three thousand five hundred yards</measure> long, enclosing a battery of <num value="4">four</num> heavy guns in <placeName key="tgn,2005345" n="1.000 21" reg="spanish fort, baldwin, alabama">Spanish Fort</placeName>, overlooking the bay, and strengthened by <num value="3">three</num> redoubts so located that they commanded very well the right and center of the position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>The whole artillery consisted of <num value="6">six</num> heavy guns, <num value="14">fourteen</num> fieldpieces, and <num value="12">twelve</num> <persName n="Coehorn,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00216.02339" reg="mostcommon:Coehorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Coehorn</surname></persName> mortars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>Several additional guns were received during the operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>Of this line there were <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> on the extreme right, in front of which the forest had been cut down, but no defensive works constructed; about <measure n="350yards" type="distance">three hundred and fifty yards</measure> in the center, across a deep ravine, in front of which was only a slight curtain partially complete; and about <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> on the extreme left, with no works of any kind, and the dense forest covering that flank untouched. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2518"/>The <num value="3">three</num> redoubts gave no mutual support with the exception of <num value="2">two</num> guns in redoubts <num value="2">2</num> and <num value="3">3</num>, and no cross-fire could be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>The main line from redoubt <num value="3">3</num> was retired without any deviation, and the left flank was thrown back and fell off into such low ground that artillery could not be used to any extent along its front, as in a regularly laid out <hi rend="italics">cremaillere</hi>. The works from redoubt <num value="3">3</num> were placed so far back on the retreating slope that the infantry could only command its crest, but not the ravine beyond; and, generally, from the center to the extreme left flank, the enemy's line was upon the highest ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>Such was the extent and incomplete condition of the defences at <placeName key="tgn,2005345" n="1.000 21" reg="spanish fort, baldwin, alabama">Spanish Fort</placeName> when, on assuming command, I carefully inspected them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>It was apparent that an immense work with the spade, pick, and axe was before us, and that some decisive measure must be adopted to prevent the large army already upon our front from coming upon us vigorously or by an onset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>At once the main body was disposed along the rifle-pits and set hard at work, though there was quite a deficiency of tools. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/>Special parties were detailed to lay off a long line of battle as far in advance of the position as they could go, and to make campfires along its whole length; and other devices were employed to create an exaggerated impression of our numbers and to conceal <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> the exact locality of our positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>To gain time, and by a show of confidence and boldness, to make the enemy cautious, I resolved to attack him before daylight the next morning.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>Our object seemed to be accomplished, for it was not until late in the evening that he advanced, feeling his way cautiously, and, making no assault, invested our defences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>My scouts had reported <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi> in front of us (the <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> and <num value="16" type="ordinal">Sixteenth</num>), <persName n="Canby,Major-General,,,," id="n0039.0031.00217.02341" reg="nearbymention:Canby,E.,R.,S.,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Canby</surname></persName> commanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/>From information derived from the prisoners, and from drawings and maps captured with <num value="1">one</num> of the engineers of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 16">Sixteenth corps</orgName>, I estimated the force to be not less than <num value="20000">20,000</num> muskets strong-perhaps much larger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>On his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advance he succeeded at some points in pushing his skirmishers to within <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure>; on the center and right he was driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>Our artillery fire was reserved until his <orgName n="Light Battery" type="battery">light batteries</orgName> came well up, when it was suddenly opened, and it appeared to be with decided effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>On the left the ground was more favorable to the enemy, and to this fact and the want of works may be ascribed the nearness with which he was enabled to establish himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>On the right and center he was held at bay to the very close of the operations, nor did he at any time gain any decided advantages without severe contests and heavy losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>He sat down before us and developed rapidly a system of regular approaches by parallels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>He gradually converted his advanced lines into heavy works, and after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> week displayed an exceedingly large armament of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>The absolute necessity of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> completing our lines and the smallness of my force, prevented the attempt to meet his approaches by any system of advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>There was a great deficiency of tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>Spades, axes, and every available instrument that could be of service in any way were kept busy night and day from the commencement~ to the close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of the investment (the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> I believe) <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00217.02342" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,Bryan,M.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="ALReserves">Alabama Reserves</orgName> was relieved by <persName n="Holtzclaw,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00217.02343" reg="nearbymention:Holtzclaw,J.,F.,,"><surname>Holtzclaw</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Ector,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00217.02344" reg="mostcommon:Ector,nomatch:0"><surname>Ector</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName>, both together exceeding <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00217.02345" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,Bryan,M.,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>' by about <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> <num value="100">hundred</num> muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>Large detachments from these commands did not rejoin them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>While the transfer was being made, my force was greatly swollen, but the troops were for the most part out of position awaiting transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>Sickness and constant heavy details diminished the number of muskets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> my artillery, aided by well trained sharpshooters, was able to cope with that of the enemy; sometimes silenced his guns and often broke up his working parties in handsome style; but after this time it was evident, from his overwhelming resources in men and guns, that it would be impossible with the means at my disposal to arrest his gradual advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>While he was steadily digging up to our front and flanks, his fleet kept up a well-directed and heavy fire in our rear, and mortars dropped over the entire surface shells of the largest size; his batteries in rear of his right flank bombarded <orgName n="Battery Huger" type="battery">batteries Huger</orgName> and <orgName n="Battery Tracy" type="battery">Tracy</orgName>, exposing our communication and sweeping the woody flat upon the left flank, enfiladed for several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> that part of the line, and took in reverse &mdash; the center and right &mdash; the batteries and riflepits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>So his batteries in front of redoubt <persName n="McDermott,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00218.02346" reg="mostcommon:McDermott,nomatch:0"><surname>McDermott</surname></persName>, <num value="2">No. 2</num>, looked down upon our whole right, and took in reverse the left center and left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>Our works were shaped a good deal like a <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoe</rs> pressed open, and those batteries at the toe and heels could command every part of the line, and these batteries were of the weightiest metal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>An expedition between us and <placeName reg="Blakeley, Baldwin, Alabama" key="tgn,2179274">Blakely</placeName>, in Bay Minette, was daily growing more formidable, and it became necessary to guard our water flanks by picket-boats, and to dispose a considerable force to protect our rear and the telegraph lines, and the headway against his fleet and barges. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>Several attempts were made by concentrated bombardment from day to day to demoralize the troops, with the intention to take advantage of any accident, and likewise repeated efforts to advance his lines without digging; but in each instance he was repulsed with a loss proportioned to the vigor of the attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time he established himself very close to <placeName reg="redoubt 2">redoubt 2</placeName>, ahd it became necessary, in order to hold this battery and use it effectively, to dislodge him. It was designed to make a general attack on his part of the line to the extreme right, and <persName n="Watson,Captain,Clement,S.,," id="n0039.0031.00218.02347" reg="default:Watson,Clement,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Clement</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Watson</surname></persName>, my inspector general, led the sortie in front of the <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> battery and was completely successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>This party <measure n="3" type="captured">captured three</measure> times their own number of the enemy under cover of our artillery; and the moral effect was still more important, for it inspired our troops with a bolder spirit and the enemy with increased caution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>After this the enemy guarded carefully against sudden dashes; and though frequent combats at particular points took place, and a few more sorties were contemplated, none could be undertaken with a reasonable prospect of success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>I found by the <dateStruct value="-04-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> that all my artillery was about silenced; that the enemy had largely increased his; that his working parties, greatly reinforced at every point and carefully protected against sorties, were pushing forward at a rate that would bring them up to our main works; that the pressure upon my flanks, especially the left, was so heavy that it would take my whole force to resist it successfully; that his preparations of launches in the <rs type="place">Bay of Minettee</rs> had assumed formidable proportions; and finally, that there was unusual activity and movements in his lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>I determined to develop the situation; to discover as accurately as possible his strength and intentions, and to measure our ability for further defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>It was apparent from his superiority in heavy guns and numbers, and the nearness of his approach at several points, that unless extraordinary reinforcements could be had, the moment had at length arrived when I could no longer hold the position without imminent risk of losing the garrison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>Not an officer or man had taken any unbroken rest, except such as they could snatch while on duty in the main works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>When there was no fighting there was digging, cutting, moving ammunition, taking down and putting up heavy guns, and repairing damages and extending the main lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/><measure n="2weeks" type="date">Two weeks</measure> of constant work, night and day, with the musket and spade, failed to discourage, but could not fail to fatigue and jade the troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Just at sunset, therefore, all the batteries were ordered to open, and the skirmishers and parts even of the main line to keep up a a brisk fire, and all officers to observe the enemy closely, and to hold themselves in readiness for any contingency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>My artillery was soon disabled and silenced, and the fire from his advanced lines showed them to be filled with men-strong lines of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/><pb id="p.220" n="220"/> </p> 
<p>Shortly after dark, while the firing was very heavy from all points, and especially upon the flanks, the enemy broke through the line on the extreme left, completely turned the flank of the main works and captured some of the men in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>He was enabled to do this, for the ground here was covered with water, a marshy and densely-wooded flat, and it had been impossible to get earth to throw up works or to make any covering for our men. A battery from an elevated point on the enemy's line, just in front of this flat, swept through it and rendered it almost untenable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>He was at once attacked with the force disposed in advance for this very contingency, and the moment <persName n="Holtzclaw,General,,,," id="n0039.0031.00220.02348" reg="nearbymention:Holtzclaw,J.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Holtzclaw</surname></persName> gave the information, reinforcements were hastened to him with orders to drive back the enemy by a front and flank attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>The general reported his force not sufficient for this purpose, and there was some confusion among the troops on the extreme left; that in the dark woods and fallen timber, the necessary disposition could not be made; and that the enemy was certainly in overwhelming strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>My staff officers and scouts brought similar intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/><persName n="Campbell,Colonel,F.,L.,," id="n0039.0031.00220.02349" reg="default:Campbell,F.,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gibson,,,,," id="n0039.0031.00220.02350" reg="nearbymention:Gibson,R.,L.,,"><surname>Gibson</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, was at once withdrawn from the right and directed to dispose a part of his command in skirmish order around the enemy, and to post the rest as a <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> at the headway, so as to hold and secure the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/>They at once drove back the advancing line of the enemy, and so strong and vigorous were these attacks that they soon compelled his overwhelming and constantly swelling forces to assume the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>He set to work to entrench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>Our left might have been thrown back and re-established, but the labor for such an undertaking was altogether beyond our ability. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/>Moreover, he had advanced several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in rear of our works, and the probability arose almost to a certainty that as soon as he discovered where he really was, a <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName> would be ordered; and he surely would ascertain this fact either during the night, or beyond all question, at daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>His lodgment, too, when developed, would have enabled him to cut off retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>I determined, therefore, to withdraw my troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/>My standing orders from <persName n="Maury,Major-General,D.,H.,," id="n0039.0031.00220.02351" reg="default:Maury,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName>, commanding District of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, had been not to hold <placeName key="tgn,2005345" n="1.000 21" reg="spanish fort, baldwin, alabama">Spanish Fort</placeName> for a moment after the garrison was in danger of capture &mdash; not to risk <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> in the defence of an outpost forces intended to occupy and defend the stronghold and the works around <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>It was always a difficult and delicate task to decide, but I thought the moment had at length arrived contemplated by my instructions, when, however painful to the devoted defenders, the position had to be given up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>The guns were ordered to be spiked, and time was allowed for this purpose; the few remaining stores were issued; the sick and wounded were carefully removed &mdash; the infirmary corps and several <num value="100">hundred</num> negroes who arrived that evening to be employed in the defence; and finally, in good order, the whole garrison was withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>The retreat was along a narrow treadway, about <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> wide, which ran from a small peninsula from the left flank across the river, and over a broad marsh to a deep channel opposite <orgName n="Battery Huger" type="battery">Battery Huger</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>It was about <measure n="1200yards" type="distance">twelve hundred yards</measure> long and was commanded throughout by the enemy's heavy batteries in front of our left flank. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>This being quickly done, they were directed quietly to get the oars in position and pull away with all their strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>They did so. I expected a parting volley from the deck of the ship, and judging from the speed with which the little boat travelled, you would have thought we were trying to outrun the bullets which might follow us. No shot was fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>As soon as the infantry had passed I rode down the line of guns, ordering all with less than <num value="15">fifteen</num> rounds of ammunition to remain in their position, and fire over the heads of the infantry, and all with over that number to move forward and support the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>On reaching him I found <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0036.00271.02913" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, himself and <persName n="Rodes,,,,," id="n0039.0036.00271.02914" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,nomatch:0"><surname>Rodes</surname></persName> in the porch, or, rather, I should say arbor, attached to the house already mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>No <num value="1">one</num> else was there, and at that time all idea of advancing that night against the heights beyond <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> for the purpose of attack had been abandoned, as it was then after sunset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>I was soon given to understand that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0036.00271.02915" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s purpose was to ascertain our condition, what we knew of the enemy and his position, and what we could probably do next day. It was evident from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that it was his purpose to attack the enemy as early as possible next day-at daylight, if practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>This was a proposition the propriety of which was so apparent that there was not the slightest discussion or difference of opinion upon it. It was a point taken for granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>After we had given <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0036.00271.02916" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> all the information we possessed, addressing us conjointly, he asked: <quote>Can't you, with your corps, attack on this flank at daylight to-morrow?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>I was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to speak, for I had examined more thoroughly and critically than the others the enemy's position east of <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>, extending along <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName> and the adjacent heights to <placeName reg="Culps Hill, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2271366">Culp's Hill</placeName>, as my <num value="2">two</num> brigades immediately confronted it, and it was peculiarly my duty to do so. Moreover, I had been in <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> the week before, <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> when there was no enemy there, and had noticed the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of the surrounding country; and, while I was seeking that afternoon to have a further advance made, I had observed that on our right of the town (northwest of it) the ascent to the ridge was much easier and gentler than on the other side, as well as that the <rs>Round Tops</rs> commanded the whole position, though I did not then know their names. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>The purport of what I said was, that the ground over which we would have to advance on our flank was very rugged and steep; that the enemy was then evidently concentrating and fortifying in our immediate front, and by morning would probably have the greater part of his force concentrated on that flank and the position strongly fortified, as ours were the only troops then confronting him in close proximity; that we could not move through the town in line of battle, and would therefore have to go on the left of the town right up against <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName> and the rugged hills on the left of it; and that the result of an attack there might be doubtful, but if successful it would inevitably be at very great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>I then called <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0036.00272.02917" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s attention to the <rs>Round Tops</rs>, the outline of which we could see, though dusk was approaching, and sug. gested that those heights must evidently command the enemy's position and render it untenable; and I also called his attention to the more practicable nature of the ascents on that side of the town, adding the suggestion that the attack could be made on that side, and from our right flank, with better chances of success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>With these views both <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0039.0036.00272.02918" reg="nearbymention:Ewell,Generell,,,"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Rodes,,,,," id="n0039.0036.00272.02919" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,nomatch:0"><surname>Rodes</surname></persName> coincided, and they submitted further considerations in the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>There was some conversation upon the several points suggested, when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0036.00272.02920" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, being satisfied that it'was not advisable to make the main assault from our flank, remarked, interrogatively:. <quote>Then perhaps I had better draw you around towards my right, as the line will be very long and thin if you remain here, and the enemy may come down and break through it?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>This was very nearly the language he used, and I spoke at once in reply, for it was a conceded fact that the arrival of my division had decided the fortunes of the day, and I did not like the idea of giving up anything we had gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>My men, who had marched to the <rs>Susquehanna</rs> and returned without serious opposition, were very much elated with the success of the day, and I shared their feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>I knew <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> what a damper it would be to their enthusiasm to be withdrawn from the position they had gained by fighting, as it might appear to them as if a reverse had occurred somewhere and we had not gained much of a victory after all. Moreover; there were some of my wounded not in a condition to be removed, and I did not like the idea of leaving those brave fellows to the mercy of the enemy; and there were a great many muskets stacked in the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName> which I did not want to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>So I replied at once to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0036.00273.02921" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and assured him that he need not fear that the enemy would break throuh our line, and that we could repulse any force he could send against us. The fact was, that on that part of the line it was more difficult for the enemy to come down from the heights to attack us than for us to ascend them to attack him, as difficult as the latter would have been. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>The part we proposed to ourselves to perform in achieving that victory, was to follow up the success that might be gained on the right, and pursue and destroy the enemy's forces when they had been thrown in disorder by the capture of the commanding positions on their left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>We did not, therefore, by any means, propose to play the part of passive spectators. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>We were then given to understand that the attack should begin from our right at daylight in the morning, or as soon thereafter as practicable, and that a diversion should be made on our flank to favor it, with the direction to make that diversion a real attack on discovering any disorder or symptoms of giving way on the enemy's part &mdash; which latter is what is meant by a favorable opportunity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>This is substantially a correct narrative of what was said and concluded upon at the conference referred to, and it will be seen that <persName n="Taylor,Colonel,,,," id="n0039.0036.00275.02949" reg="nearbymention:Taylor,Walter,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> is under a serious misapprehension in regard to it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>He did not regard his officers as mere machines to execute his will, but he treated them as thinking beings, capable of reasoning, and even aiding him by their suggestions about matters with which they were familiar, in arriving at his conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>He had likewise a profound knowledge of human nature, and it was his custom to talk freely to officers about movements they were to make, get their views about the proper mode of making them, in order to ascertain whether they could be relied upon for the work in hand, adopt any judicious views they might suggest, and leave them under the impression that they were carrying out plans in the formation of which they had some part; for he knew that <num value="1">one</num> of the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elements of success was a confidence on the part of an officer entrusted with a movement in its feasibility, and therefore sought to enlist all his energies in the task entrusted to him by a little humoring of his self-love. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>He sought information from us on this occasion about the matters mentioned because he thought we possessed it, and he heard with attention our suggestions, because he expected us to perform an important part in the ensuing operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>From the very nature of things, he could not rely on his own observation to find out everything necessary to enable him to discharge the functions <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> of <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, and had very often to rely on the eyes and ears of others. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>When he left us on this occasion, I was so firmly impressed with the conviction that the battle was to open at daylight next morning that <num value="1">1</num> rode into <placeName key="tgn,7014060" n="1.000 6" reg="gettysburg, adams, pennsylvania">Gettysburg</placeName>, and, as soon as it was dark enough to avoid observation, I drew <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Hays,,,,," id="n0039.0036.00276.02953" reg="mostcommon:Hays,nomatch:0"><surname>Hays</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName> out of the town, to the left of it, and posted it on a line with <persName n="Hoke,,,,," id="n0039.0036.00276.02954" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoke</surname></persName>'s, under cover of the low ridge already mentioned, not far from the base of <placeName key="tgn,2230256" n="1.000 81" reg="cemetery hill, adams, pennsylvania">Cemetery Hill</placeName>, so as to be ready at the earliest moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>The facts subsequently developed show that we were right in anticipating that the enemy would concentrate in our immediate front, and strongly fortify the position during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>He concentrated on that flank not only the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">First</orgName>, <orgName type="corps" n="corps 11">Eleventh</orgName>, and <orgName type="corps" n="corps 12">Twelfth corps</orgName>, but the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> and <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, as they arrived, and all of them remained there until the morning was considerably advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>Had we, therefore, attacked on that flank early in the morning, we would have been met by overwhelming numbers, and a bloody repulse must have been the consequence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>The opportunity referred to could only be when a considerable success was achieved on our right, and the enemy in front of the left thrown into confusion, or it was discovered that he had considerably weakened his force there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>Upon declamations of vague generalities in inaugural addresses and messages to Congress I set little account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>Did he ever originate any negotiation or make any overture for peace upon any terms on which it could probably be obtained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>I never doubted but that he would accept peace if our independence were acknowled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>But did he ever offer peace on any conditions short of this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>At the beginning I believe he did offer to make peace if our independence were .acknowledged and the public property fairly divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3577"/>This was fair enough, it is true; but did any <num value="1">one</num>, even <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0039.0038.00304.03439" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, sup-,pose that such terms would be accepted at that time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>I did not deal with those words critically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/>Whether he means that we had no right to confer anywhere else I know not. If he considered the place as a matter of importance he should have been more specific, and doubtless he would have been obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3586"/>But we all supposed that the main object of the commission was the <hi rend="italics">conference</hi>, and that the place was a matter of little or no importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3587"/>Taking the instructions and the circumstances under which they were issued together, no <num value="1">one</num>, I think, would have concluded differently. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>None, I think, would have inferred from that conversation that the place was a matter of importance, as the main design of the conference was not to treat of peace, but to ascertain the disposition of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>I thought any limitation of the range of discussion was unwise and inexpedient, but I did not say so in the communication which seems to have given offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>Thus it seems to have been viewe by the other party as an improper limitation on the field of discussion, although I did not anticipate the objection I confess; I suppose from <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0038.00305.03448" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,J.,P.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>'s correspondence that he did also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>I considered the objection when made as idle and frivolous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>In a matter concerning so deeply the happiness and welfare of a great people, I regarded such small points as absurd and frivolous. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>At the time when this debate occurred I considered the introduction unfortunate, but if intended as a restriction upon making <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> a treaty of peace on the condition of reunion I should have considered them as right at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3594"/>I knew when we started on that mission that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was very low in point of resources; but the extent of our destitution I did not understand, until on our way to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> <persName n="Campbell,Judge,,,," id="n0039.0038.00306.03449" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName> gave me the substance of his recent letter to <persName n="Breckenridge,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0038.00306.03450" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName> on that subject, stating our utter destitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3595"/>I never supposed that we were authorized to treat for peace when sent on that mission; and if we had been, none of the <rs>Confederate</rs> commissioners, in my opinion, would at that time have accepted peace on the condition of reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3602"/>How can a beligerent lay down his arms before treating without submnitting himself to the mercy of his adversary?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3603"/>Under the influence of this feeling, in which we nearly all concurred, I did declare in a speech at the <orgName n="African Church" type="church">African church</orgName>, that my feelings were outraged ,by such a declaration, and urged a continued resistance sooner than submit to such terms, or if we should be forced to yield, to anake that submission as dear to the enemy as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/>I defended myself at the time, but have often thought since that under the circumstances I ought not to have made the speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3607"/>I <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> did not utterly neglect my duty to the people, but endeavored to soften their fall as much as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3608"/>Shortly after my return to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, in an interview I had with the <rs>President</rs> in his own house, not at my instance, but at his invitation, I urged that if he thought as I did, that all chance of our success was gone and further resistance hopeless, it became him to consider whether some accomodation with the enemy might not be obtained which would be better than the terms that would be allowed us after a surrender at discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3609"/>I urged it upon him that he owed it to his own reputation and character as well as to a gallant people to leave some evidence of his having endeavored to mitigate their sufferings and secure them some relief when further resistance had become hopeless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>I told him, further, that I knew the difficulties in the way of his making the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> propositions for treating to the <name>Senate</name>; that many would treat it as a confession of despair, and this might only impel the enemy to greater exertions; but thai I thought I could promise that the <name>Senate</name> would pass resolutions requesting him to negotiate for peace and ascertain the terms that could be had, if he would allow me to assure them that he could carry them out and do his utmost to settle the matter on the best terms possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>I assured him that I thought there would be no difficulty in obtaining these resolutions, by which the <name>Senate</name> would-have assumed the responsibility and take it from his shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>I said that, if necessary, I would introduce the resolutions myself, and we could draw them together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>There was a senator of high character and of many noble qualities sick at a neighboring house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>He had so much influence in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that, if he had been for peace, the movement would have been irresistible in the <rs>Congress</rs> if backed by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>Upon the proposition of <num value="1">one</num> of us &mdash; I forget whichwe went to see him and discussed the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>Unfortunately, as I thought then, and still think, he did not concur with me. When questioned during these interviews of my own opinion as to the chances of peace, I replied that I could not say, whilst remembering <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0038.00307.03453" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s declaration that he would not treat whilst we retained arms in our hands, but said that the interests for peace were so great that I doubted if he would be allowed to retain that extreme ground; but at any rate, if we made just efforts for peace <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> and failed through the cruelty or vengeance of our enemy, the fact of our having made the attempt would relieve our Government, and particularly the <rs>President</rs>, from much responsibility that would otherwise attach to us. (<persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0038.00308.03454" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> came to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> just before his death, and spoke of propositions of peace in a conversation with <persName n="Campbell,Judge,,,," id="n0039.0038.00308.03455" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,F.,L.,,:3"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, which indicated that we might, perhaps, have maintained our autonomy in the states, which would have been vastly better than what did occur after the surrender.) After we separated I scarcely expected to hear more from this conversation; but soon, perhaps the next day after, I heard it was bruited all over <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> that I had been thoroughly conquered, had submitted, and was disposed to make peace on any terms, with many other disparaging remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>Amongst others, the <rs>President</rs>'s aids were said to be freely discussing these matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>How did they get hold of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>It is true there was no positive pledge of secresy in these conversations, but, from their nature and the circumstances discussed, their confidential character was to have been implied, and ought to have been respected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>The main reasons which led me to think that the <rs>President</rs> ought to move in this matter were found in the condition of our resources, which could not be revealed to the world without doing much mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3621"/>Indeed, it was impossible to do it: so that I was taken at a great disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>How the character of the conversation got out I never did know, but always had my suspicions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>It was not very long after this before <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0038.00308.03456" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> came to my room <num value="1">one</num> night to talk upon this subject of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/>It was the last time I ever saw him, and our conversation ran nearly through the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>He said if I thought there was a chance for any peace which would secure better terms than were likely to be given after a surrender at discretion, he thought it my duty to make the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>I related to him my former effort and its result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>I told him it would do no sort of good, for any effort I might make would be misrepresented and laid before the public as soon as it was made, with a view to injure my influence, in which it would probably be suecessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>I told him I would engage in no confidential work with <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0038.00308.03457" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> unless the former affair were satisfactorily explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>For, although I did not know that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0039.0038.00308.03458" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> had revealed the former conversation, yet the circumstances under which it was reported and the use made of it were suspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>He again <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> repeated his remark that, in his opinion, it was my duty to offer such resolutions in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>He said if he were to recommend peace negotiations publicly it would be almost equivalent to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>I told him I was aware of this, but, if he thought the chance for success desperate, I thought he ought to say so to the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>To this he made no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>In the whole of this conversation he never said to me he thought the chances were over; but the tone and tenor of his remarks made that impression on my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>He spoke of a recent affair in which the <rs>Confederates</rs> had repelled very gallantly an attempt of the <rs>Federals</rs> to break his line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>The next day, as he rode along the lines, <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers would thrust forth his bare foot and say, <quote>General, I have no shoes.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>Another would declare, as he passed, <quote>I am hungry; I haven't enough to eat.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>These and other circumstances betraying the utmost destitution he repeated with a melancholy air and tone which I shall never forget. </p>

In this I may have been guilty of forgetting some high-sounding asseverations for peace in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inaugural after the establishment of the <rs>Provisional Government</rs>, but I hardly think that my recent experience with him would have justified me in considering him as a firm and longproclaimed advocate for peace. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>The remarks upon the subject of subsistence are applicable to the forage, fuel, and clothing requisite for the army service, and in regard to the supply of animals for cavalry and artillery.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>How came the country to be so bare of the supplies necessary for the efficient prosecution of the war. When we seceded the country had gathered in a large crop of cotton-between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of bales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>That amount of cotton, in my opinion, would have exchanged for food, clothing, arms, medical stores, and all the necessary supplies in abundance for the war-enough, probably, to have enabled <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0039.0038.00310.03464" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, with the troops which he handled with such consummate ability, to have conquered a peace upon fair terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>But those who believed <quote>that cotton was king</quote> had an extravagant notion of its value and a queer theory as to its use. They believed that the <rs>Government</rs> ought to acquire it, and sell it to supply its wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>An impracticable view, in my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>Government makes a poor trader, in peace or in war, and could not have commanded the means to utilize such a crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>But the people and the <rs>Government</rs> were in favor of prohibiting private individuals from using the article by selling it where it would bring the most, and exercised a strict surveillance over the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>On the contrary, the only mode of effecting the exchange spoken of above was through private individuals, and if this had been allowed and encouraged early in the war, as ought to have been done, that exchange might have been made &mdash; if not wholly, to a great extent-and the horrors of the war much abated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>I wish I could have defeated it altogether, for I regard its approach to a passage as a stain upon Confederate history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>And now it would be said we had done the very thing which we professed to fear from them, and without any more constitutional right than they would have had, if they had done the same thirg.
