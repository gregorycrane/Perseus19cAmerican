<head>Foreword</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The opening chapter of this work was prepared during the recent presidential campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It was the idea of the author that it should appear in <num value="1">one</num> of the leading newspapers or magazines before the election, but maturer reflection brought about a change of purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>He realized that its publication at that time, might, not altogether unreasonably, be looked upon as a political move having as its object the election or defeat of a particular candidate for office, whereas he had no desire to play the partisan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>His sole aim was to vindicate the character of a portion of the citizens of this country --some living, some dead-whom he had always believed to be most deserving of popular esteem, from what he considered the unmerited aspersions of a man who has since come into a position so conspicuous and so influential that his condemnation necessarily carries with it a damaging effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Having gone so far as the preparation of the initial chapter, he concluded that proofs of his assumptions and assertions might at certain points be thought desirable, if not necessary, and that he should so prolong his work as to provide them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea at this point, as his years went back beyond the beginning of the <name>Abolitionist</name> movement in this country, and as he had been from early boyhood <pb id="p.-003" n="-003"/> identified with this movement, was to contribute such information as his recollection of events would supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>In other words, he decided to write a narrative, the matter of which would be reminiscent, with here and there a little history woven in among the strands of memory like a woof in the warp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It has ended in history supplying the warp, and the reminiscence indifferently supplying the woof.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>However, the value of the production is, doubtless, greatly enhanced by the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>A string of pearls-dropping the former simile and adopting another &mdash; is estimated according to the gems it contains, and not because of the cord that holds it together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The personal experiences and recollections that are here and there interwoven, by themselves would be of little consequence; but they will be found to carry upon them certain historical facts and inferences &mdash; some new in themselves and in their connections-which, as the author hopes and believes, are of profitable quality and abounding interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In consequence of the change of plan just explained, the scope of the work is materially affected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>What was begun as a magazine article, and continued as a brochure, ends in a volume.</p>

<p>Owing to a variety of causes, the <name>Abolitionists</name> have received an immense amount of hysterical praise which they do not deserve, and have been credited with deeds done by other men whom, in reality, they hampered and opposed rather than aided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>After <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, the professed Abolitionists formed a small and comparatively unimportant portion of the forces that were working towards the restriction and ultimate destruction of slavery; and much of what they did was positively harmful to the cause for which they were fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Those of their number who considered the <rs>Constitution</rs> as a league with death and hell, and who, therefore, advocated a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, acted as rationally as would antipolygamists nowadays if, to show their disapproval of Mormonism, they should advocate that <placeName key="tgn,7007827;tgn,1118534" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7007827;utah,United States,North and Central America;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,1118534;utah lake, utah, utah,Utah,Utah,United States,North and Central America" reg="utah,United States,North and Central America;utah lake, utah, utah,Utah,Utah,United States,North and Central America">Utah</placeName> should be allowed to form a separate nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The only hope of <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> ultimately suppressing slavery lay in the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>, and every Abolitionist who argued or signed a petition for the dissolution was doing as much to perpetuate the evil he complained of, as if he had been a slave-holder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Liberty party, in running <persName n="Birney,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00004" reg="nearbymention:Birney,James,G.,,"><surname>Birney</surname></persName>, simply committed a political crime, evil in almost all its consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They in no sense paved the way for the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, or helped forward the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery cause, or hurt the existing organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Their effect on the <name>Democracy</name> was <hi rend="italics">nil;</hi> and all they were able to accomplish with the <rs>Whigs</rs> was to make them put forward for the ensuing election a slaveholder from <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, with whom they were successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Such were the remote results of their conduct; the immediate evils they produced have already been alluded to. They bore considerable resemblance-except that after all they really did have a principle to contend for &mdash; to the political Prohibitionists of the present day, who go into the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> party organization, and are, not even excepting the saloon-keepers themselves, the most efficient allies on whom intemperance and the liquor traffic can count.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Anti-Slavery men like <persName n="Giddings,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00005" reg="nearbymention:Giddings,Joshua,R.,,"><surname>Giddings</surname></persName>, who supported <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><surname>Clay</surname></persName>, were doing a thousandfold more effective work for the cause they had at heart than all the voters who supported <persName n="Birney,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00007" reg="nearbymention:Birney,James,G.,,"><surname>Birney</surname></persName>; or, to speak more accurately, they were doing all they could to advance the cause, while the others were doing all they could to hold it back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> occupied more nearly the ground held by <persName n="Clay,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00009" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><surname>Clay</surname></persName> than that held by <persName n="Birney,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00010" reg="nearbymention:Birney,James,G.,,"><surname>Birney</surname></persName>; and the men who supported the latter in <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct> were the prototypes of those who worked to oppose <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00002.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and only worked less hard because they had less chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The ultra Abolitionists discarded expediency, and claimed to act for abstract right on principle, no matter what the results might be; in consequence they accomplished very little, and that as much <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> for harm as for good, until they ate their words, and went counter to their previous course, thereby acknowledging it to be bad, and supported in the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> the men and principles they had so fiercely condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The Liberty party was not in any sense the precursor of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which was based as much on expediency as on abstract right, and was, therefore, able to accomplish good instead of harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>To say that extreme Abolitionists triumphed in Republican success and were causes of it, is as absurd as to call Prohibitionists successful if, after countless efforts totally to prohibit the liquor traffic, and after savage denunciations of those who try to regulate it, they should then turn round and form a comparatively insignificant portion of a victorious high-license party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The men who took a great and effective part in the fight against slavery were the men who remained with their respective parties.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He has no encomiums to bestow on those same men and women for the protracted and exhausting labors they performed, the dangers they encountered, the insults they endured, the sacrifices they submitted to, the discouragements they confronted in many ways and forms in prosecuting their arduous undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>On the contrary, he has only bitter words of condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In his estimation, and according to his dogmatic utterance, they were criminals-political criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><pb id="p.4" n="4"/></p> 
<p>His words make it very manifest that, if <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00004.00013" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName> had been a voter in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, he would not have been an Abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He would not have been <num value="1">one</num> of that devoted little band of political philanthropists who went out, like <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> of old, to do battle with <num value="1">one</num> of the giant abuses of the time, and who found in the voter's ballot a missile that they used with deadly effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>On the contrary, he would have enrolled himself among their adversaries and assailants, becoming a member-because it is impossible to think of <persName n="Roosevelt,,Theodore,,," id="n0164.0002.00004.00014" reg="default:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName> as a nonpartisan &mdash; of <num value="1">one</num> of the leading political parties of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In failing to support <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these parties, and giving their votes and influence to a new <num value="1">one</num> that was founded and constructed on Anti-Slavery lines, the <name>Abolitionists</name>, in <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00004.00015" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>'s opinion, <quote>committed a political crime.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Now, for what did those parties stand in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Who were their presidential candidates in that year?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><persName n="Buren,,Martin,,,Van" id="n0164.0002.00004.00016" reg="expanded:Buren,Martin,,,"><foreName>Martin</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName> was the candidate of the <name>Democrats</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He had been for <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> in the offices of <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> and <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and in that time, in the opinion of the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery people of the country, had shown himself to be a facile instrument in the hands of the slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He was what the <name>Abolitionists</name> described as a <quote>doughface</quote> --a Northern man with Southern principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>As presiding officer he gave the casting vote in the <name>Senate</name> for the bill that excluded Anti-Slavery matter from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> mails, a bill justly regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest outrages ever perpetrated in a free <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> country, and as holding a place by the side of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>. True, he afterwards &mdash; this was in <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>,--like <persName n="Saul,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00005.00017" reg="mostcommon:Saul,nomatch:0"><surname>Saul</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7002623" n="1.000 1" reg="tarsus,icel ili,akdeniz kiyisi,turkiye,asia">Tarsus</placeName>, saw a new light and announced himself as a Free Soiler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Then the <name>Abolitionists</name>, with what must always be regarded as an extraordinary concession to partisan policy, cast aside their prejudices and gave him their support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Yet <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00005.00018" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName> charges them with being indifferent to the demands of political expediency.</p>

When <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of the <placeName reg="Indiana, Indiana, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013794">Territory of Indiana</placeName>, he presided over a convention that met for the purpose of favoring, notwithstanding the prohibition in the <name>Ordinance</name> of &lsquo;<num value="87">87</num>, the introduction of slavery in that Territory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>These were the men between whom the old parties gave the <name>Abolitionists</name> the privilege of pick and choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Declining to support either of them, they gave their votes to <persName n="Birney,,James,G.,," id="n0164.0002.00005.00020" reg="expanded:Birney,James,Gillespie,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Birney</surname></persName>, candidate of the newly formed Liberty party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He was a Southern man by birth and a slave-owner by inheritance, but, becoming convinced that slavery was wrong, he freed his negroes, giving them homes of their own, and so frankly avowed his Anti-Slavery convictions that he was driven from his native State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>His supporters did not expect to elect him, but they hoped to begin a movement that would lead up to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They were planting seed in what they believed to be receptive soil.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>After <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, the old parties became more and more submissive to the <rs>Slave Power</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Conjointly, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> they enacted those measures that became known as the compromises of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, the principal ones being the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs> and the act repealing the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Both of them pronounced these acts to be <quote>a finality,</quote> and both of them in <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">national convention</orgName> declared there should be no further agitation of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They set out to muzzle all the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery voices of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>By this time it was perfectly manifest that there was not only nothing the slaveholders might demand which the old parties would not concede, but that there was, so far as the slavery issue was involved, absolutely no difference between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is a notable fact that in the <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> following <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, of the <num value="4">four</num> presidential candidates put in nomination by the <num value="2">two</num> parties, <num value="3">three</num> were slaveholders, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> being a Northern <quote>doughface,</quote> and both of the <num value="2">two</num> who were elected held slaves.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They forced the poor Whigs into those proceedings, he intimates, probably by telling them they ought to do nothing of the kind, that being what they actually did tell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>From that time, with occasional backsets, <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00007.00027" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>'s <quote>political criminals</quote> went steadily forward until they mastered the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, they were a power in the land, causing the older parties to quake, Belshazzar-like, at sight of their writing on the wall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But according to <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00007.00028" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>, the men of the <rs>Liberty-Free</rs>-Soil party had no share in fathering and nurturing the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, to which he assigns all the credit for crushing slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Says he, <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> <quote>The Liberty party was not in any sense the precursor of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which was based as much on expediency as on abstract right.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is very true that many Republicans, especially in the earlier days, were neither Abolitionists nor Anti-Slavery people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>A good many of them, like <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0164.0002.00008.00029" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, were sentimentally adverse to slavery, but under existing conditions did not want it disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Many of them, having broken loose from the old parties, had no other place of shelter and cared nothing for slavery <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, some being of the opinion of <num value="1">one</num> of the new party leaders whom the writer hereof heard declare that <quote>the niggers are just where they ought to be.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>All this, however, does not prove that the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-party people were not the real forerunners and founders of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They certainly helped to break up the old organizations, crushing them in whole or part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>They supplied a contingent of trained and desperately earnest workers, their hearts being enlisted as well as their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And what was of still greater consequence, they furnished an issue, and <num value="1">one</num> that was very much alive, around which the detached fragments of the old parties could collect and unite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Their share in the composition and development of the new party can be illustrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Out in our great midland valley <num value="2">two</num> rivers &mdash; the <rs>Missouri</rs> and the Mississippi-meet and mingle their waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/><placeName reg="The Missouri">The Missouri</placeName>, although the larger stream, after the junction is heard of no more; but being charged with a greater supply of sedimentary matter, gives its color to the combined flood of the assimilated waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Abolitionism was merged <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> in Republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It was no longer spoken of as a separate element, but from the beginning it gave color and character to the combination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The whole compound was Abolitionized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It was not, indeed, the voting strength, although this was considerable, that the <name>Abolitionists</name> brought to the <rs>Republican</rs> organization, that made them the real progenitors of that party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is possible that the other constituents entering into it, which were drawn from the <rs>Anti-Slavery Whigs</rs>, the <quote>Anti-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName></quote> Democrats, the <quote>Barnburner</quote> Democrats of New York, the <quote>Know-Nothings,</quote> etc., numbered more in the aggregate than the <name>Abolitionists</name> it included; but it was not so much the number of votes the <name>Abolitionists</name> contributed that made them the chief creators of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, as it was their working and fighting ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>They had undergone a thorough training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>For nearly <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> they had been in the field in active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>For the whole of that time they had been exposed to pro-slavery mobbing and almost every kind of persecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>They had to conquer every foot of ground they occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>They had done an immense amount of invaluable preparatory work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>To deny to such people a liberal share of the credit for results accomplished, would be as reasonable as to say that men who clear the land, plough the ground, and sow the seed, because others may help to gather the harvest, have nothing to do with raising the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But for the pioneer work of the <name>Abolitionists</name> there would have been no <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>There had been Anti-Slavery people in this country <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> before the Abolitionists-conscientious, zealous, intelligent-but somehow they lacked the ability, in the language of the pugilists, to <quote>put up a winning fight.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They had been brushed aside or trampled under foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Not so with the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>They had learned all the tricks of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>They were not afraid of opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They knew how to give blows as well as to take them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The result was that from the time they organized for separate political action in <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>, they had made steady progress, although this seemed for a period to be discouragingly slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It was only a question of time when, if there had been no <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, they would have succeeded in abolishing slavery without its assistance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Although, as before remarked, the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> was made up of a good many elements besides the <name>Abolitionists</name>, there was among them but little homogeneousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>They were indifferent, if not hostile, to each other, and, if left to themselves, would never have so far coalesced as to make a working party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>They had no settled policy, no common ground to stand on. They would have been simply a rope of sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>But the <name>Abolitionists</name> supplied a bond of union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>They had a principle that operated like a loadstone in bringing the factions together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>There was another inducement the <name>Abolitionists</name> had to offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>They had an organization that was perfect in its way. It was weak but active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>It had made its way into Congress where it had such representatives as <persName n="Hale,,John,P.,," id="n0164.0002.00010.00030" reg="default:Hale,John,P.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName> and <persName n="Chase,,Salmon,P.,," id="n0164.0002.00010.00031" reg="expanded:Chase,Salmon,Portland,,"><foreName>Salmon</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> in the <name>Senate</name>, and several brilliant men in the <rs type="place">Lower House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>It had a complete outfit of party machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It had an efficient force of men and women engaged <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> in canvassing as lecturers and stump orators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>It had well managed newspapers, and the ablest pens in the country &mdash; not excepting <persName n="Stowe,,Harriet,Beecher,," id="n0164.0002.00011.00032" reg="default:Stowe,Harriet,Beecher,,"><foreName>Harriet</foreName> <foreName>Beecher</foreName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>'s &mdash; were in its service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>All this, it is hardly necessary to say, was attractive to people without political homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The Abolitionists offered them not only shelter but the prospect of meat and drink in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>In that way their organization became the nucleus of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which was in no sense a new organization, but a reorganization of an old force with new material added.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>And here would seem to be the proper place for reference to the historical fact that the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, under that name, had but <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of existence behind it when the great crisis came in the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00011.00033" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the beginning of the <rs>Civil War-Lincoln</rs>'s election being treated by the <rs>South</rs> as a <foreign lang="la">casus belli.</foreign> The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> was established under that name in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00011.00034" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was elected in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Now, the work preparatory to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00011.00035" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election was not done in <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>. The most difficult part of it &mdash; the most arduous, the most disagreeable, the most dangerous-had been done long before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Part of it dated back to <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Indeed, the performance of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> in those <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> was not remarkably brilliant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>With the slogan of <quote>Free soil, free men, and <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00011.00036" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName></quote> it made an ostentatious demonstration in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>-an attempted <foreign lang="fr">coup de main</foreign>--which failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It would have failed quite as signally in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, but for the division of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> into the <name>Douglas</name> and <name>Breckenridge</name> factions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>That division was pre-arranged by the <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> slaveholders who disliked <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00012.00037" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:3"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, the regular Democratic nominee, much more than they did <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00012.00038" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and who hoped and plotted for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0002.00012.00039" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election because it furnished them a pretext for rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The change of name from <quote>Free soil</quote> or <quote>Liberty</quote> to <quote>Republican</quote> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct> had very little significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It was a matter of partisan policy and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/><quote>Liberty</quote> and <quote>Free soil,</quote> as party cognomens, had a meaning, and were supposed to antagonize certain prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/><quote>Republican,</quote> at that juncture, meant nothing whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Besides, it was sonorous; it was euphonious; it was palatable to weak political stomachs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The ready acceptance of the new name by the <name>Abolitionists</name> goes very far to contradict <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00012.00040" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>'s accusation against them of being regardless of the claims of political expediency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The writer has shown, as he believes, that without the preparatory work of the political Abolitionists there would have been no <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>He will now go a step further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>He believes that without that preliminary service there would not only have been no <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, but no Civil War in the interest of free soil, no <persName n="Proclamation,,Emancipation,,," id="n0164.0002.00012.00041" reg="default:Proclamation,Emancipation,,,"><foreName>Emancipation</foreName> <surname>Proclamation</surname></persName>, no <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> and <num value="14" type="ordinal">Fourteenth</num> Amendments to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>There might have been and probably would have been considerable discussion, ending in a protest, more or less <quote>ringing,</quote> when slavery was permitted to overstep the line marked out by the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>There might even have been another settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>But no such adjustment would <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> have seriously impeded the northward march of the triumphant Slave Power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Indeed, in that event it is more than probable that ere this the legal representatives of the late <rs>Robert Toombs</rs>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, would, if so inclined, have made good his boast of calling the roll of his slaves at the foot of <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName> monument.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>So far we have dealt with <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00013.00042" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>'s indictment of the <name>Abolitionists</name> for abandoning the old pro-slavery political parties, and undertaking to construct a new and better <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>That, in his judgment, was a political crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>But he charges them with another manifestation of criminality which was much more serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He accuses them of hostility to the <rs>Union</rs>, which was disloyalty and treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The evidence offered by him in support of his accusation was the <name>Anti</name>-<placeName reg="Unionist">Unionist</placeName> position taken by <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0164.0002.00013.00043" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, who branded the <rs>Union</rs> as a <quote>league with hell,</quote> and some of his associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He denounced it almost as bitterly as <persName n="Roosevelt,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0002.00013.00045" reg="nearbymention:Roosevelt,Theodore,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roosevelt</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>He relied on moral suasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He saw no salvation in politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The formation of a new Anti-Slavery party excited his fiery indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>He declared that it was <quote>ludicrous in its folly, pernicious as a measure of policy, and useless as a political contrivance.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Far and away the most potential member and leader of the political Abolitionists was <persName n="Chase,,Salmon,P.,," id="n0164.0002.00013.00047" reg="expanded:Chase,Salmon,Portland,,"><foreName>Salmon</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Instead of denouncing the <rs>Constitution</rs> as <quote>a league with death and hell,</quote> he claimed that it <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> was an Anti-Slavery document and should be so construed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>As for the <rs>Union</rs>, by his services in successfully managing the finances of the country in its great crisis, he did as much to sustain the <rs>Union</rs> as any other man of that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>To accuse him of hostility and infidelity to the <rs>Union</rs>, is something that no <num value="1">one</num> can do with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>In selecting those who are to receive its remembrance and its honors, the world has always given its preference to such as have battled for freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It may have been with the sword; it may have been with the pen; or it may have been with a tongue that was inflamed with holy rage against tyranny and wrong; but whatever the instrumentality employed; in whatever field the battle has been fought; and by whatsoever race, or class, or kind of men; the champions of human liberty have been hailed as the bravest of the brave and the most worthy to receive the acclaims of their fellows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Now, if that estimate be not altogether inaccurate, what place in the scale of renown must be assigned to those pioneers in the successful movement against <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery in this country who have commonly been known as <quote>Abolitionists</quote> --a name <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> given in derision by their enemies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>It should, in the opinion of the writer hereof, be the very highest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>He is not afraid to challenge the whole record of human achievements by great and good men (always save and except that which is credited to the <name>Saviour</name> of mankind) for exhibitions of heroism superior to theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Nay, when it is remembered that mainly <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> through their efforts and sacrifices was accomplished a revolution by which <num value="4000000">four million</num> human beings (but for the <name>Abolitionists</name> the number to-day in bondage would be <num value="8000000">eight millions</num>) were lifted from the condition in which <orgName type="college" n="American college">American</orgName> slaves existed but a few years ago, to freedom and political equality with their former masters; and, at the same time when it is considered what qualities of heart and brain were needed for such a task, he does not believe that history, from its earliest chapters, furnishes examples of gods or men, except in very rare and isolated cases, who have shown themselves to be their equals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>In the matter of physical courage they were unsurpassed, unsurpassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>A good many of them were <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName> and non-resistants, and a good many of them were women, but they never shrank from danger to life and limb, when employed in their humanitarian work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Some of them achieved the martyr's crown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>In the matter of conscience they were indomitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Life to them was worth less than principle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>In the matter of money they were absolutely unselfish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Those of them who were poor, as the most of them were, toiled on without the hope of financial recompense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>They did their work not only without the promise or prospect of material reward of any kind, but with the certainty of pains and penalties that included the ostracism and contempt of their fellows, and even serious risks to property and life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>All these sacrifices were in the cause of human liberty; but of liberty for whom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>That is the crucial point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>In all ages there have been plenty of <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> men who have honorably striven for liberty for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The Abolitionists, however, espoused the cause, and it was for that that they endured so much, of creatures that were infinitely below them; of beings who had ceased to be recognized as belonging to humanity, and were classed with the cattle of the field and other species of <quote>property.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>So low were they that they could neither appreciate nor return the services rendered in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>For their condition, the <name>Abolitionists</name> were in no sense responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>They had no necessary fellowship with the unfortunates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They were under no especial obligation to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>They were not of the same family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>It was even doubted whether the races had a common origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>And yet, to the end of securing release for these wretched victims of an intolerable oppression, not a few of them dedicated all they possessed-life not excepted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>True it is that they had no monopoly of benevolence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Many noble men and women have gone as missionaries to the poor and benighted, and have sought through numerous hardships and perils to raise up those who have been trodden in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>But, as a rule, their services have been rendered pursuant to a secular employment that carried financial compensation, and behind their devotion to the poor and oppressed has been the expectation of personal reward in another world, if not in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/><pb id="p.18" n="18"/> But such motives barely, if at all, influenced the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>No element of professionalism entered into their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>They were not particularly religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>They neither very greatly reverenced nor feared the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, whose leaders they often accused of a hankering for the <quote>flesh-pots</quote> that induced them to lead their followers into <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, rather than out of it. They were partly moved by a hatred of slavery and its long train of abuses that was irrepressible, and which to most persons was incomprehensible, and partly by a love for their fellows in distress that was so insistent as to make them forget themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Their impulses seemed to be largely intuitive, if not instinctive, and if called upon for a philosophical explanation they could not have given it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>In such a struggle for freedom and natural human rights as was carried on by the <name>Abolitionists</name> against tremendous odds and through a term covering many long years, it does seem to the writer of this essay that mortal heroism reached its height.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Nor am I by any means alone in the opinion just expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>As far back as <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>, when the <name>Abolitionists</name> were few in number and the objects of almost savage persecution in every part of our country, the <rs>Earl</rs> of <persName n="Carlisle,,,,," id="n0164.0003.00018.00051" reg="mostcommon:Carlisle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlisle</surname></persName>, who, in his day was <num value="1">one</num> of the most capable leaders of <name>British</name> public opinion, declared that they were engaged <quote>in fighting a battle without a parallel in the history of ancient or modern heroism.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>I am moved to write the story of the <name>Abolitionists</name>, partly because it is full of romantic interest, and partly because justice demands it. Those doughty <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> file leaders in the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery fight do not to-day have an adequate acknowledgment of the obligations that the country and humanity should recognize as belonging to them, and they never have had it. Much of the credit that is fairly theirs has been misapplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Writers of history-so called, although much of it is simple eulogy &mdash; have been more and more inclined to attribute the overthrow of slavery to the efforts of a few men, and particularly <num value="1">one</num> man, who, after long opposition to, or neglect of, the freedom movement, came to its help in the closing scenes of a great conflict, while the earlier, and certainly equally meritorious, workers and fighters have been quite left out of the account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The writer does not object to laborers who entered the field at the <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> hour, sharing with those who bore the heat and burden of the day; but when there is a disposition to give to them all the earnings he does feel like protesting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The case of the <name>Abolitionists</name> is not overstated when it is said that, but for their labors and struggles, this country, instead of being all free, would to-day be all slaveholding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The relative importance of their work in creating, by means of a persistent agitation, an opposition to human slavery that was powerful enough to compel the attention of the public and force the machine politicians, after long opposition, to admit the question into practical politics, cannot well be overestimated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>They alone and single-handed fought the opening battles of a great war, which, although overshadowed and obscured by later and more dramatic events, were none the less gallantly waged and nobly won. <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> It is customary to speak of our Civil War as a <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>It was really a <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> war, beginning when the pioneer Abolitionists entered the field and declared for a life-and-death struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>It was then that the hardest battles were fought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>I write the more willingly because comparatively few now living remember the mad excitement of the slavery controversy in ante-bellum days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The majority &mdash; the living and the working masses of to-day --will, doubtless, be gratified to have accurate pictures of scenes and events of which they have heard their seniors speak, that distinguished the most tempestuous period in our national history &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> in which the wildest passions were aroused and indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Then it was that the fiercest and bitterest agitation prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The war that followed did not increase this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It rather modified it-sobered it in view of the crisis at hand-and served as a safety-valve for its escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>For the same reason, the general public has now but slight comprehension of the trials endured by the <name>Abolitionists</name> for principle's sake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>In many ways were they persecuted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In society they were tabooed; in business shunned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>By the rabble they were hooted and pelted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Clowns in the circus made them the subjects of their jokes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Newspaper scribblers lampooned and libelled them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Politicians denounced them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>By the <rs type="place">Church</rs> they were regarded as very black sheep, and sometimes excluded from the fold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>And this state of things lasted for years, during which they kept up a steady agitation with the help of platform lecturers, and regularly threw <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> away their votes-so it was charged &mdash; in a <quote><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> party</quote> movement that seemed to be a hopeless venture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Another inducement to the writer to take up the cause of the <name>Abolitionists</name> is the fact that he has always been proud to class himself as <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He came into the world before Abolitionism, by that name, had been heard of; before the <orgName n="Abolition Society 1" type="society">first Abolition Society</orgName> was organized; before <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0164.0003.00021.00052" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> founded his <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, and before (not the least important circumstance) <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0164.0003.00021.00053" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> entered Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>He cannot remember when the slavery question was not discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>His sympathies at an early day went out to the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>He informed himself on the subject as well as a farmer boy might be expected to do in a household that received the most of its knowledge of current events from the columns of <num value="1">one</num> weekly newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>He cast his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> vote for the ticket of the <name>Abolitionists</name> while they were yet a <quote><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> party.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The community in which he then lived, although in the free <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName>, was strongly pro-slavery, being not far from the <rs>Southern</rs> border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The population was principally from <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>There were a few Abolitionists, and they occasionally tried to hold public meetings, but the gatherings were always broken up by mobs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The writer very well remembers the satisfaction with which he, as a schoolboy, was accustomed to hear that there was to be another Abolition <quote>turnout.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The occasion was certain to afford considerable excitement that was dear to the heart of a boy, and it had another recommendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The only <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> room in the village-<quote>town</quote> we called it &mdash; for such affairs, except the churches, which were barred against <quote>fanatics,</quote> was the district schoolhouse, which, by common consent, was open to all comers, and as the windows and doors, through which missiles were hurled during Anti-Slavery gatherings, were always more or less damaged, <quote>we boys</quote> usually got a holiday or <num value="2">two</num> while the building was undergoing necessary repairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>As might be surmised, the lessons I learned at school were not all such as are usually acquired at such institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>My companions were like other children, full of spirit and mischief, and not without their prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>They hated Abolitionists because they &mdash; the Abolitionists-wanted to compel all white people to marry <quote>niggers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Although not naturally unkind, they did not always spare the feelings of <quote>the son of an old Abolitionist.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We had our arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Some of them were of the knock-down kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In more than <num value="1">one</num> shindy, growing out of the discussion of the great question of the day, I suffered the penalty of a bloody nose or a blackened eye for standing up for my side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The feeling against the negroes' friends &mdash; the <name>Abolitionists</name> &mdash; was not confined to children in years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>It was present in all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It entered State and Church alike, and dominated both of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The Congressional Representative from the district in which I lived in those days was an able man and generally held in high esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>He made a speech in our village when a candidate for re-election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>In discussing the slavery question &mdash; everybody discussed it then-he spoke of the negroes as being <quote>on <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> the same footing with other cattle.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>I remember the expression very well because it shocked me, boy that I was. It did not disturb the great majority of those present, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They cheered the sentiment and gave their votes for the speaker, who was re-elected by a large majority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>About the same time I happened to be present where a <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> of <num value="1">one</num> of our largest religious denominations was in session, and listened to part of an address by a noted divine &mdash; the most distinguished man in the body &mdash; which was intended to prove that slavery was an institution existing by biblical authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>He spent <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> in a talk that was mostly made up of scriptural texts and his commentaries upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>This was in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, and there was not a slave-owner in the assembly, and yet a resolution commendatory of the views that had just been declared by the learned doctor, was adopted by an almost unanimous vote.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>In the neighborhood in which I lived was an old and much respected clergyman who was called upon to preach a sermon on a day of some national significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>He made it the occasion for a florid panegyric upon American institutions, which, he declared, assured freedom to all men. Here he paused, <quote>When I spoke of all men enjoying freedom under our flag,</quote> he resumed, <quote>I did not, of course, include the <name>Ethiopians</name> whom <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has brought to our shores for their own good as well as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>They are slaves by a divine decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>As descendants of <persName n="Ham,,,,," id="n0164.0003.00023.00054" reg="mostcommon:Ham,nomatch:0"><surname>Ham</surname></persName>, they are under a curse that makes them the servants of their more fortunate white brethren.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Having thus put himself right on the record, he <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> proceeded with his sermon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>No <num value="1">one</num> seemed to take exception to what he said.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>In the same neighborhood was a young preacher who had shortly before come into it from somewhere farther North.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>In the course of <num value="1">one</num> of his regular services he offered up a prayer in which he expressed the hope that the good <rs>Lord</rs> would find a way to break the bands of all who were in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>That smacked of Abolitionism and at once there was a commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The minister was asked to explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>This he declined to do, saying that his petition was a matter between him and his <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and he denied the right of others to question him. That only increased the opposition, and in a short time the spunky young man was compelled to resign his charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>About that time there appeared a lecturer on slavery &mdash; which meant against slavery &mdash; who carried credentials showing that he was a clergyman in good standing in <num value="1">one</num> of the leading Protestant denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>In our village was a church of that persuasion, whose pastor was not an Abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>As in duty bound, the visiting brother called on his local fellow-laborer, and informed him that on the following day, which happened to be <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, he would be pleased to attend service at his church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>On the morrow he was on hand and occupied a seat directly in front of the pulpit; but, notwithstanding his conspicuousness, the home minister, who should, out of courtesy, have invited him to a seat in the pulpit, if to no other part in the services, never saw him. He looked completely over his head, keeping his eyes, all through the exercises, fixed upon the back pews, <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> which happened, on that occasion, to be chiefly unoccupied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Such incidents, of themselves, were of no great importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Their significance was in the fact that they all occurred on the soil of a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>They showed the state of feeling that then and there existed. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The writer has spoken of the courage of the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>There is another trait by which they were distinguished that, in his opinion, should not be passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>That was their extreme hopefulness-their untiring confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>No matter how adverse were the conditions, they expected to win. They never counted the odds against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They trusted in the right which they were firmly persuaded would prevail some time or another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>For that time they were willing to wait, meanwhile doing what they could to hasten its coming.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The writer, when a boy, was witness to an exhibition of the same spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>A kinsman of his was a zealous Abolitionist, although not particularly gifted with controversial acumen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>He and his minister, as often happened, were discussing the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The minister, like many of his cloth at that time, was a staunch supporter of <quote>the institution,</quote> which, according to his contention, firmly rested on biblical authority.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It is unnecessary to follow the discussion, but, <num value="1">one</num> after another, the quicker-witted and better-informed preacher successfully combated all the propositions advanced by my relative in trying to give a reason for the faith that was in him, until he was completely cornered.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>My kinsman lived long enough to see the day <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> when there was not a slave on American soil, and the minister lived long enough to become a roaring Abolitionist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It was doubtless their confidence in ultimate triumph, a result of their absolute belief in the righteousness of their cause, that, as much as anything else, armed and armored the <name>Abolitionists</name> against all opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> main element of their strength in the midst of their weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Without it they could not have persisted, as they did, in their separate or <quote><num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> party</quote> political action, that cleared the way and finally led up to a victorious organization.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Why was it that this devotion to slavery and this hostility to its opposers prevailed in the non-slaveholding States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They had not always existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Indeed, <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> there was a time, not so many years before, when slavery was generally denounced; when men like <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0164.0005.00031.00057" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Booker,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0164.0005.00031.00058" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>, although themselves slave-owners, led public opinion in its condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Northernly slave States could not produce cotton, but they could produce negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>They shared in the golden harvest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Such cities as <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> became centers of a flourishing traffic in human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They had great warehouses, commonly spoken of as <quote>nigger pens,</quote> in which the <quote>hands</quote> that were to make the cotton were temporarily gathered, and long coffles &mdash; that is, processions of men and women, each with a hand attached to a common rope or <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> chain-marched through their streets with faces turned southward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The slave-owners were numerically a lean minority even in the <rs>South</rs>, but their mastery over their fellow-citizens was absolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Nor was there any mystery about it. As the owners of <num value="4000000">four million</num> slaves, on an average worth not far from <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> each, they formed the greatest industrial combination-what at this time we would call a trust-ever known to this or any other country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Our mighty Steel Corporation would have been a baby beside it. If to-day all our great financial companies were consolidated, the unit would scarcely come up to the dimensions of that <num value="1">one</num> association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>It was not incorporated in law, but its union was perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Bound together by a common interest and a common feeling, its members &mdash; in the highest sense co-partners in business and in politics, in peace and in war &mdash; were prepared to act together as <num value="1">one</num> man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>But why, I again ask, were the <rs>Northern</rs> people so infatuated with slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>They raised no cotton and they raised no negroes, but many of them, and especially their political leaders, carried their adulation almost to idolatry.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They claimed the credit for such achievements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/><pb id="p.33" n="33"/></p> 
<p>There were reasons for such a state of things &mdash; some very solid, because financial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> were extensively interlaced by mutual interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>With slave labor the <rs>Southern</rs> planters made cotton, and with the proceeds of their cotton they bought Northern machinery and merchandise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>They sent their boys and girls to Northern schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>They came North themselves when their pockets were full, and freely spent their money at Northern hotels, Northern theatres, Northern race-tracks, and other Northern places of entertainment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Then there were other ties than those of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The great political parties had each a Southern wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Religious denominations had their Southern members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Every kind of trade and calling had its Southern outlet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>But social connections were the strongest of all, and probably had most to do in making Northern sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Southern gentlemen were popular in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>They spent money lavishly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Their manners were grandiose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They talked boastfully of the number of their <quote>niggers,</quote> and told how they were accustomed to <quote>wallop</quote> them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Then there were marriage ties between the sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Many domestic alliances strengthened the bond between slavery and the aristocracy of the <rs>North</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>In the circles in which these things were going on, it was the fashion to denounce the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Women were the most bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The slightest suspicion of sympathy with the <quote>fanatics</quote> was fatal to social ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>But when she consented to preside over a small conference of Anti-Slavery women, society cut her dead, her former associates refusing to recognize her on the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The families of <persName n="Arthur,,,,," id="n0164.0005.00034.00063" reg="mostcommon:Arthur,nomatch:0"><surname>Arthur</surname></persName> and <persName n="Tappan,,Lewis,,," id="n0164.0005.00034.00064" reg="default:Tappan,Lewis,,,"><foreName>Lewis</foreName> <surname>Tappan</surname></persName>, the distinguished merchants of New York, were noted for their intelligence and culture, but when the heads of the families came to be classified as Abolitionists the doors of all fashionable mansions were at once shut against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They in other ways suffered for their opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The home of <persName n="Tappan,,Lewis,,," id="n0164.0005.00034.00065" reg="default:Tappan,Lewis,,,"><foreName>Lewis</foreName> <surname>Tappan</surname></persName> was invaded by a mob, and furniture, books, and <hi rend="italics">bric-a-brac</hi> were carried to the street and there burned to ashes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The masses of the <rs>Northern</rs> people were, however, led to favor slavery by other arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was that the slaves, if manumitted, would at once rush to the <rs>North</rs> and overrun the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I have heard that proposition warmly supported by fairly intelligent persons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Another argument that weighed with a surprisingly large number of people, was that civil equality would be followed by social equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>As soon as they were free, negro men, it was said, would marry white wives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/><quote>Do you want your son or your daughter to marry a nigger?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>was regarded as a knockout anti-Abolitionist argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The idea, of course, was absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/><quote>Is it to be inferred that because I don't want a negro woman for a slave, I do want her for a wife?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>was <num value="1">one</num> of the quaint and pithy observations attributed to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0005.00034.00066" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>And yet there were plenty of Northern people to whom <quote>Amalgamation</quote> --the word used to describe the apprehended union of the races &mdash; was a veritable scarecrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>A young gentleman in a neighborhood near where I lived when a boy was in all respects eligible for matrimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He became devoted to the daughter of an old farmer who had been a Kentuckian, and asked him for her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/><quote>But I am told,</quote> said the old gentleman, <quote>that you are an Abolitionist.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The young man admitted the justice of the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/><quote>Then, sir,</quote> fairly roared the old man, <quote>you can't have my daughter; go and marry a nigger.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>But what probably gave slavery its strongest hold upon the favor of Northern people was the animosity toward the negro that prevailed among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Nowhere was he treated by them like a human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The <quote>black laws,</quote> as those statutes in a number of free States that regulated the treatment of the blacks were appropriately called, were inhuman in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/><placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> was in the main a liberal State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>She was called a free State, but her negroes were not free men. Under her laws they could only remain in the <rs>State</rs> by giving bonds for good behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> employing negroes, not so bonded, was liable to a fine of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure>. They could not vote, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>They could not testify in a case in which a white man was interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>They could not send their children to schools which they helped to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The only thing they could do <quote>like a white man</quote> was to pay taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/><pb id="p.36" n="36"/></p> 
<p>The prejudice against the poor creatures in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> was much stronger than that they encountered on the other side of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName> in the slave <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">State of Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Here &mdash; in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>--they were property, and they generally received the care and consideration that ownership ordinarily establishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The interest of the master was a factor in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>In many instances there was genuine affection between owner and slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/><quote>How much better off they would be if they only had good masters,</quote> was a remark I very often heard in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, as the negroes would go slouching by with hanging heads and averted countenances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>There is no doubt that at this time the physical condition of the blacks was generally much better in slavery than it was in freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>What stronger testimony to the innate desire for liberty &mdash; what <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n0164.0005.00036.00068" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName> has described as <quote>The eternal spirit of the chainless mind</quote> --than the fact that slaves who were the most indulgently treated, were constantly escaping from the easy and careless life they led to the hostilities and barbarities of the free States, and they never went back except under compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It was assumed to express the feelings of colored fugitives from bondage when they had time to realize what freedom meant in their cases, but I never heard the words <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> from the lips of a man who had lived in a state of servitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>I have elsewhere referred to the fact that women were often the most bitter in their denunciations of the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>In the neighborhood in which I passed my early days was a lady who was born and raised in the <rs>North</rs>, and who probably had no decided sentiment, <num value="1">one</num> way or the other, on the slavery question; but who about this time spent several months in a visit to <num value="1">one</num> of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>She came back thoroughly imbued with admiration for <quote>the institution.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>She could not find words to describe the good times that were enjoyed by the wives and daughters of the slave-owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>They had nothing to do except to take the world easy, and that, according to her account, they did with great unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The slaves, were, she declared, the happiest people in the world, all care and responsibility being taken from their shoulders by masters who were kind enough to look out for their wants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>But <num value="1">one</num> day she unwittingly exposed a glimpse of the reverse side of the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>She told the story of a young slave girl who had been accused of larceny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>She had picked up some trifling article that ordinarily no <num value="1">one</num> would have cared anything about; but at this time it was thought well to make an example of somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The wrists of the poor creature were fastened together by a cord that passed through a ring in the side of the barn, which had been put there for that purpose, and she was drawn up, with her face to the building, until her toes barely touched the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Then, in the <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> presence of all her fellow-slaves, and with her clothing so detached as to expose her naked shoulders, she was flogged until the blood trickled down her back.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The speaker who happened to be present was a relative of the author and a red-hot Abolitionist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Then came a furious war of words, the <num value="2">two</num> enraged women shouting maledictions in each other's faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>As a boy, I enjoyed the performance hugely until I began to see that there was danger of a collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>As the only male present, it would be my duty to interfere in case the combatants came to blows, or rather to scratches and hair-pulling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>I did not like the prospect, which seemed to me to be really alarming, and was thinking of some peaceable solution, when the <num value="2">two</num> women, looking into each other's inflamed faces, suddenly realized the ridiculousness of the situation and broke into hearty peals of laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>That, of course, ended the controversy, not a little to the relief of the writer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>If the influence of a great majority of the women of that day was thrown on the side of slavery, as was undoubtedly the case, the minority largely made up for the disparity of numbers by the spunk and aggressiveness of their demonstrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>A good many of the most indomitable and effective Abolition lecturers were women-such as <persName n="Mott,Mrs.,Lucretia,,," id="n0164.0005.00038.00069" reg="default:Mott,Lucretia,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Lucretia</foreName> <surname>Mott</surname></persName>, the <name>Grimke</name> sisters, <persName n="Kelly,,Abby,,," id="n0164.0005.00038.00070" reg="default:Kelly,Abby,,,"><foreName>Abby</foreName> <surname>Kelly</surname></persName>, and others whose names are here omitted, although they richly deserve <pb id="p.39" n="39"/> to be mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>I heard her once, and it seemed to me that I never listened to a tongue that was so sharp and merciless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Her eyes were small and it appeared to me that they contracted, when she was speaking, until they emitted sparks of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Although she went by her maiden name, she was a married woman, being the wife of <persName n="Foster,,Stephen,,," id="n0164.0005.00039.00072" reg="default:Foster,Stephen,,,"><foreName>Stephen</foreName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>, a professional Abolitionist agitator and lecturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Although himself noted for the bitterness of his speech, when it came to hard-hitting vituperation he could not begin to <quote>hold a candle</quote> to his little wife.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The <num value="2">two</num> traveled together and spoke from the same platforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>They were constantly getting into hot water through the hostility of mobs, which they seemed to enjoy most heartily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The only meeting addressed by them that I attended, though held on the <name>Sabbath</name>, was ended by the throwing of stones and sticks and addled eggs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>But if the current of public opinion in the <rs>North</rs> suddenly turned, and for a long time ran with overwhelming force in favor of slavery, it changed about almost as suddenly and ran with equal force in the opposite direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The county in which I lived when a boy, that furnished only <num value="1">one</num> vote for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Abolitionist presidential ticket, became a Republican stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>It was in what had been a Whig district, and when the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName> went to <pb id="p.40" n="40"/> pieces, the most of its <hi rend="italics">debris</hi> drifted into the <rs>Republican</rs> lines.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>A few years thereafter, on my return to the village after a considerable absence, I found that I had come just in time to attend a Republican rally which was that day to be held in a near-by grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>It is equally certain that they had firmly resolved to capture the entire commonwealth for their <quote>institution,</quote> and had laid their plans to that end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>They saw the danger in such association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>If, through any mischance, it failed in its calculation, the next step would be to tear down the house and from its ruins reconstruct so much of it as might be needed for its own occupancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>That it would be able in time to possess itself of the whole country, however, for and in behalf of its industrial policy, it did not for an instant doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>It was not empty braggadocio on the part <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> of the celebrated <rs>Robert Toombs</rs>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, when he uttered his famous boast.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> 
<p>See <ref n="page 13">page 13</ref>.</p></note> He voiced the practically unanimous opinion of his section.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Nor was there anything seemingly very presumptuous in that anticipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>So far, the <rs>South</rs> had been invariably victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>In what appeared to be a decisive battle in the test case of admitting <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> into the <rs>Union</rs> as a slave State, it had won. So pronounced was its triumph that whatever Anti-Slavery sentiment survived the conflict appeared to be stunned and helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>All fight was knocked out of it. Its spirit was broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>While the <rs>South</rs> was not only compact and fully alive, but exultingly aggressive, the <rs>North</rs> was divided, fully <num value="0.5">one half</num> of its population being about as pro-slavery as the slaveholders themselves, and the rest, with rare exceptions, being hopelessly apathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The Northern leaders of both of the old political parties-Whig and Democratic &mdash; were what the <name>Abolitionists</name> called <quote>dough-faces,</quote> being Northern men with Southern principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The <rs type="place">Church</rs> was <quote>a dumb dog,</quote> and the press simply drifted with the tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It was not at all strange that the slaveholders expected to go on from conquest to conquest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> policies they could adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/><num value="1">One</num> was to attack the enemy's citadel; or rather, the several citadels it possessed in its individual States, and force them to open their doors to the master and his human chattels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The other was to flank and cover, approaching the main point of attack by way of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>These, once in possession of the slaveholders, could be converted into enough <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> slave States to give them the control of the general government, from which coigne of advantage they could proceed in their own time and way to possess themselves of such other free States as they might want.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>In the matter of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> they had a great advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>The <rs>North</rs> was up against a stone wall at the <rs>Canadian</rs> border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>In that direction it could not advance a step, while the <rs>South</rs> had practically an unlimited field on its side from which to carve possessions as they might be wanted, very much as you would cut a pie.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>In pursuance of its territorial policy-being the line of action it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolved upon &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement of the <rs>South</rs> was to annex <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>--a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The next was to make war on <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and (a joke of the day) conquer a <quote>piece</quote> from it large enough to make half a dozen States, all expected to be slaveholding-another victory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>By a curious irony the filching of land for slavery's uses from a neighbor, and on which the foot of a slave had never pressed, was exultingly spoken of at the time by its supporters as <quote>an extension of the area of freedom.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>The act was justified on the ground that we needed <quote>land for the landless,</quote> which led <persName n="Wade,,Benjamin,F.,," id="n0164.0006.00044.00082" reg="default:Wade,Benjamin,F.,,"><foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Wade</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> to assert on the floor of the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Then came the battle over <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The passage of the <rs>Kansas</rs>-<placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName> Bill in Congress, although involving a breach of good faith on the part of the <rs>South</rs>, was hailed as another victory for that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/><pb id="p.45" n="45"/> It was a costly victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>It was followed by defeat not only disastrous but fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The result in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> was really the turning-point in the great struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It broke the line of Southern victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>It neutralized the effect of the whole territorial movement up to that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>It completely spoiled the slaveholders' well-laid plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>We will always give <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00045.00083" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and his men all praise for victories leading up to Appomatox, but, in some respects, the most important victory of the great conflict was won on the plains of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> by <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0164.0006.00045.00084" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Ossawattomie">Ossawattomie</placeName> and his Abolition associates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>The most sagacious Southern leaders saw in that result conclusive proof that the scale was turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>They realized that they were beaten within the lines of the <rs>Union</rs>, and they began to arrange for going out of it. They helped to elect a Republican <rs type="role2">President</rs> by dividing the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> between <num value="2">two</num> candidates-Douglas and <persName n="Breckenridge,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00045.00085" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,Samuel,M.,,:1"><surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName> &mdash; in order that they might have a plausible pretext for secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>But the slaveholders had not abandoned the other policy to which reference has been made &mdash; that of carrying their institution, by main force, as it were, into some, if not all, of the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>To that end they had, in sporting parlance, a card up their sleeves which they proceeded to play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>That card was the decision of the <orgName n="U. S. Supreme Court" type="org">United States Supreme Court</orgName> in the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> case, upon which they relied to give them the legal power to take and hold their slaves in all parts of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Up to the date of that decision, the current of judicial rulings had been that slavery, being a municipal institution, <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> was local, while freedom was national.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Hence, when a master took his slave into a free State, at that instant he became a free man. The <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0164.0006.00046.00086" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision was intended to reverse the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Practically it held that slave ownership, wherever the <rs>Constitution</rs> prevailed, was both a legal and a natural right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>It, as <persName n="Benton,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00046.00087" reg="mostcommon:Benton,Thomas,H.,,:2"><surname>Benton</surname></persName> forcibly expressed it, <quote>made slavery the organic law of the land and freedom the exception</quote> ; or, as it was jocularly expressed at the time, it left freedom nowhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Although at the time of its promulgation, it was claimed by some of the more conservative pro-slavery leaders that the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> dictum applied only to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, giving the masters the legal authority to enter them with their slaves, that position was clearly deceptive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>The principle involved, as laid down by the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, was altogether too broad for that construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>In effect it put the proprietorship of human beings upon the same footing with other property rights,--and claimed for it the same constitutional protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The bolder men of the <rs>South</rs>, like <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00046.00088" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, did not hesitate to give that interpretation to the <rs type="place">Court</rs>'s pronouncement, and to insist on it with brutal frankness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>If they were wrong, the <rs type="place">Court</rs> was putty in their hands and they could easily have had a supplemental ruling that would have gone to any extent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>If the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision had been promulgated by our highest court, and the slaveholders had insisted upon the license it was intended to give them for taking their slave property into free territory, at the time that <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00046.00089" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> was being dragged by a mob through <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>'s streets; when <persName n="Birney,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00046.00090" reg="nearbymention:Birney,James,Gillespie,,"><surname>Birney</surname></persName>'s printingpress <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> was being tumbled into the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName>; when <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> <persName n="Hall,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00047.00091" reg="mostcommon:Hall,Robert,B.,,:1"><surname>Hall</surname></persName>, the <rs>Quaker Abolitionists</rs>' <num value="40000">forty-thousand</num>-dollar construction, was ablaze in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>; when <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00047.00092" reg="mostcommon:Lovejoy,Elijah,P.,,:3"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName>, the <name>Abolition</name> martyr, was bleeding out his life in <num value="1">one</num> of the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7015715" n="1.000 4" reg="alton, madison, illinois">Alton</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>-when, in fact, the whole land was swayed by a frenzied hatred of the men and women who dared to question slavery's right to supremacy, the writer believes the movement would have been successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>Public opinion was so inclined in States like <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and even in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, that they might have been easily toppled over to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Indeed, at that time it is a problem how <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> would have voted on a proposition to <quote>slaveryize</quote> her soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>The surprising thing, as we look back to that period, is that slavery did not get a foothold in some of the free States, if not in all of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>But by the time the <rs>South</rs> was ready to play its trump card, it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>The game was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>Public opinion had become revolutionized throughout the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>The leaven of Abolitionism had got in its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The men and women, few in number and weak in purse and worldly position as they were, who had enlisted years before in the cause of emancipation, and had fought for it in the face of almost every conceivable discouragement, had at last won a great preliminary victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Slavery, through their exertions, had become impossible, both in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and in the free States of the <rs>North</rs>, the <orgName n="U. S. Supreme Court" type="org">United States Supreme Court</orgName> and all the forces of the slave power to the contrary notwithstanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/><pb id="p.48" n="48"/></p> 
<p>Then came to the <rs>South</rs> a not unanticipated, and to many of her leaders a not unwelcome political <placeName reg="Waterloo, Monroe, Illinois" key="tgn,2030592">Waterloo</placeName>, in the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0006.00048.00093" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>This gave the argument for secession that was wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>The South had then to yield &mdash; which she had no idea of doing-or to go into rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>She went out of the <rs>Union</rs> very much as she would have gone to a frolic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>She had no thought that serious fighting was to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>She did not believe, as <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders expressed it, that the <rs>Northern</rs> people would go to war for the sake of the <quote>niggers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>The early Abolitionists were denounced as fanatics, or <quote>fan-a-tics,</quote> according to the pronunciation of some of their detractors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>They were treated as if partially insane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>It is not, perhaps, so very strange that in those days, in view of the disreputableness of those whose cause they espoused, and the apparently utter hopelessness of anything ever coming out of it, the supporters of Anti-Slaveryism should be suspected of being <quote>out of their heads.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>He learned that he could write what the newspapers would print, and give expression to words that the people would listen to. He was quick to realize the fact that the best way to reach the people of this country was through the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>He started a very small paper with a very large name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>It was ambitiously nominated <hi rend="italics">The Genius of Universal Emancipation</hi>. He began with only <num value="6">six</num> subscribers and without a press or other publishing material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>What those principles were is shown by the declaration adopted by that handful of confederates, and which, in view of the time and circumstances of its formulation, was certainly a most remarkable document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>It was the precursor of a revolution that gave both personal and political freedom to a larger number than were benefited by the other declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>But what chiefly distinguished it, the time and the situation being considered, was its radical utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>It gave no countenance to any measure of compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>It offered no pabulum to the wrongdoer in the form of compensation for stolen humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>It demanded what was right, and demanded it at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>And that fearless and unyielding platform became the basis for all the <name>Abolition</name> societies that came after it. A goodly number of such societies were organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>In view of the facts stated we can understand, not only the serenity, but the favor with which the people of this country, or the great body of them, so long looked upon the workings of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery, and the difficulty which the <name>Abolitionists</name> had in arousing a sentiment of revulsion toward it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/><num value="1">One</num> of the curious things in this connection is the similarity &mdash; the practical sameness &mdash; of the arguments used to justify the <name>Philippine</name> occupation and those once used to justify American slaveholding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>We are now working to civilize and Christianize the <name>Filipinos</name>, and were then civilizing and Christianizing the negroes with the lash and the bludgeon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>Of course, there are other arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Increase of trade and wealth, as the result of our appropriation of other peoples' possessions, is freely predicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>It has always been the robber's plea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Nor is it improved by the fact <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> that the grounds upon which it is predicated and urged are largely fallacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>The spoliation of the <name>Philippines</name> will never repay us for the blood-our own blood-and treasure it has cost us, apart from any moral or humanitarian consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>There is not <num value="1">one</num> aspect in this business that promises to redound to our benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>No, I won't say that; I would hardly be justified in going that far. In <num value="1">one</num> particular the <name>Philippine</name> operation has profited a considerable part of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It has added materially to our Army and our Navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The opportunity for enlargement in those quarters was, undoubtedly, the strongest inducement for our entering upon a colonial policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>For a great many people, and especially in official circles, we cannot have a standing army that is too large, nor too many ships of war. The more powerful those appendages of our authority the larger is the opening for the kinsmen and retainers of those in high places, who may be seeking profitable and agreeable employment, and the more liberal the contributions of contractors and jobbers to the sinews of partisan warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>Our Army to-day is nearly <num value="3">three</num> times what it was <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, although outside of the <name>Philippines</name> we are at peace with all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>Nor is that formidable advance at an end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>We may not only have to fight the <name>Russians</name> and the <name>Japanese</name> and the <name>Chinese</name>, <num value="1">one</num> or all, but those <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> foolish Filipinos may again take it into their silly heads that they can govern themselves as well or better than we can do it for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>That means rebellion, and, of course, chastisement must follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>As climatic conditions in that part of the world are such that it requires the presence of <num value="3">three</num> men in the army to supply the active services of <num value="1">one</num>, it is obvious that so long as we adhere to our present Asiatic policy, we shall never have an army and a navy large enough and strong enough to meet the requirements of our new condition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>On all questions affecting human liberty, no <num value="1">one</num> can fail to observe that the attitude of the <num value="2">two</num> great political parties of to-day, is practically that of the <num value="2">two</num> principal parties at the time the <name>Abolitionists</name> began their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Both are fatally handicapped by their connections and committals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>What this country now needs, in the opinion of the writer, is a revival of Abolitionism, and to that end, as <num value="1">one</num> of the instrumentalities that would be serviceable, he holds that the old National Anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">Slavery Society</orgName> should be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>The most of the men and women that made that institution so useful and honorable, have passed from the scenes of their labors, but a few of them are left, and they <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> and such as may feel like joining them, should meet and unfurl the old standard once more.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>And then let it go to work for the results thus indicated, in the spirit and with the confidence of the old-time leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The Society should be revived and re-established, not for a single campaign only, or for the rectification of such oppressions as are now in sight, but for all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>It ought to be made a permanent institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>It should be so arranged that the sons would step into the ranks as the fathers dropped out and that new recruits would be constantly enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Thus reorganized the grand old institution would be an invaluable watchman on the walls of Freedom's stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>The family was of the highest pretension, being related to the <name>Rhetts</name>, the <name>Barnwells</name>, the <name>Pickenses</name>, and other famous representatives of the <rs>Palmetto</rs> aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>It was wealthy, and of coarse had many slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>The girls had their colored attendants, whose only service was to wait upon them and do their bidding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>That circumstance finally led to trouble.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>At that time there was a statute in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> against teaching slaves to read and write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>They were given the alternative of <quote>behaving themselves</quote> or going North to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>The sincerity of these women was put to an unusual test.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>The community in which the writer resided when a boy, was fully up to the pacific standard of most Northern neighborhoods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>Yet it was the scene of many turmoils growing out of Anti-Slavery meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>The district schoolhouse, which was the only public building in the village that was open for such gatherings, called for frequent repairs on account of damages done by mobs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>Broken windows and doors were often in evidence, and stains from mud-balls, decayed vegetables, and antiquated eggs, which nobody took the trouble to remove, were nearly always visible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>The mob was resolved to punish that young <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> man, and had come prepared to give him a coating of unsavory mixture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>He was a preacher as well as a teacher, and his <quote>store clothes</quote> were likely to betray him; but some thoughtful person had brought an old drab overcoat and a rough workman's cap, and arrayed in these garments he walked through the crowd without his identity being suspected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>But another party was not so fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>He was a respected citizen of the village, an elder in the <orgName n="Presbyterian Church" type="church">Presbyterian church</orgName>, and a strong pro-slavery man. He dressed in black and his appearance was not unlike that of the lecturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>On another occasion the writer was present when the friends of the lecturer undertook to convey him to a place of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>They formed a circle about him and moved away while the mob followed, hurling eggs and clods and sticks and whatever else came handy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>We kept quietly on our way until we reached a place in the road that had been freshly graveled, and where the surface was covered with stones just suited to our use. Here we halted, and, with rocks in hand, formed a line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>The matter was settled by the rowdies on that occasion being more than usually demonstrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>Here is his statement: 
<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>There was an old barn on my father's farm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>It was almost a ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/><num value="1">One</num> end of the roof had fallen <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> in, pretty much all the windows were gone, and there was a general air of dilapidation about the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>A dwelling-house, to which it was an appendage, had been burned and not rebuilt, and the barn had been left to fight a battle with the elements and other foes in pretty much its own way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>Not that it was wholly abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> mow that was kept pretty well supplied with grass, and there were <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> horse stalls that were in tolerable order, although but rarely used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>There were a number of excellent hiding-places about the old rookery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>In the basement all sorts of rubbish, including unused vehicles and machinery, had been stored away, and so wedged and packed was it that it would have taken hours to uncover man or beast seeking concealment there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/><num value="1">One</num> of the curious features of the situation was that the building was in sight of none of the roads in the neighborhood, while less than a <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> from it was a strip of woods in which the removal of the larger trees had stimulated a sturdy and densely matted undergrowth that was penetrable only by means of paths that had been made by the cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>It was what was called a <quote>woods pasture.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>With this cover for his movements any <num value="1">one</num> could approach or leave the old barn with little danger of discovery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Naturally enough, such a ramshackle was in ill-repute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>There were tales about it in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>Some children had gone there to play on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, and had been badly frightened by a big &mdash; as big as <num value="0.5">a half</num>-bushel, they asserted-black face that was seen to be watching them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>They fled <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> from the premises in great alarm, and for a time there was talk of an investigation by their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>The incident, however, was soon forgotten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>That old barn was a regular station on <num value="1">one</num> of the underground railroads that extended from the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio River</placeName> to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>To but few persons was its true character known, and they were very closemouthed about it. I was <num value="1">one</num> of the few that were in the secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>Being the youngest member of the family, it fell to my lot to drive the horses and cows to and from the pasture in which the old barrack was located, and while there it was an easy matter to visit that establishment and ascertain if it sheltered any fresh arrivals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/><num value="1">One</num> day I had to report that <num value="2">two</num> fugitives were in the barn, being a mother and child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Then came the question &mdash; which in that instance was a difficult <num value="1">one</num> to answer &mdash; as to who should convey them to the next station on the line, <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>A brother, between <num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> older than I was, and who was something of a dare-devil, did the most of the work of transportation, but he was in bed with typhoid fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>A hired man, who was employed partly because he was in hearty accord with the humanitarian views of the household, and who on several occasions had taken my brother's place, was absent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>There was nobody but myself who was ready to undertake the job, and I was only <measure n="11years" type="date">eleven years</measure> old. There was no help for it, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>The slaves had to be moved on, and I was greatly rejoiced in the prospect of adventure that was opened up to me. The journey had to be made at night, but for that I cared nothing, as I <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> had repeatedly gone over the route by daylight, and thought I knew the road perfectly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Midnight found me on the highway, and on the driver's seat of <num value="1">one</num> of our farm wagons, to which was attached a span of horses moving in the direction of the north star.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>That luminary was not on this occasion visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>The sky was heavily overcast and the night was very dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>A light rain was falling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>With all the confidence I had in my own ability, more than once would I have lost the way, but for the sagacity of the horses, which had gone over that route a number of times under similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>They acted as if altogether familiar with it. Those horses proved themselves to be excellent Abolitionists.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>The inclemency of the night was in <num value="1">one</num> respect a great advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>It kept at home those who might incline to be too inquisitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>The few travelers we met passed on with a word of greeting, while I whistled unconcernedly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>Over the bottom of the wagon was scattered some hay that might be used either as feed for the horses or as a bed for weary travelers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>There was also an old-fashioned buffalo-robe, somewhat dilapidated, that could serve for concealment or as shelter from the elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/><num value="2">Two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> empty baskets suggested a return from the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>There was another article that <num value="1">one</num> would hardly have looked for. This was a smoke-cured ham loosely wrapped in some old sacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>It had gone over that route a number of times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>Its odor neutralized the smell by which the presence, immediate or recent, of negroes might be detected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/><pb id="p.125" n="125"/></p> 
<p>My fellow-travelers, as my passengers might be called, were interesting companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>Both, in <num value="1">one</num> sense, were children, the mother certainly not being over <measure n="17years" type="date">seventeen years</measure> old. She was a comely half-breed mulatto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>Her baby &mdash; a pretty boy of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>--was <num value="1">one</num> degree nearer white.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>The girl was inclined to be confidential and talkative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>She said she was <q direct="unspecified">old mas'ras</q> daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>Her mother had been <num value="1">one</num> of <q direct="unspecified">old mas'r's</q> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>She had grown up with the other slave children on the place, being in no way favored because of her relationship to her owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>The baby's father was <q direct="unspecified">young mas'r</q>-old master's son, as it appeared-and who, consequently, was <num value="0.5">a half</num>-brother of the youthful mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Slavery sometimes created singular relationships.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>As the story ran, all the people, including the narrator and her baby, when <q direct="unspecified">ole mas'r</q> died were <quote>leveled</quote> on by the <rs>Sheriff</rs>'s man. She did not quite understand the meaning of it all, but it was doubtless a case of bankruptcy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/> <q direct="unspecified">Young mas'r,</q> she said, <quote>tole</quote> her she had to run away, taking the baby of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/><quote>Oh, yes,</quote> she said very emphatically, <quote>I never would have left Kentuck without <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0164.0017.00125.00338" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName></quote> --meaning her little boy. <quote>Young mas'r,</quote> according to her account, arranged the whole proceeding, telling her what course to take by night, where to stop and conceal herself by day, and what signal to give when she reached the <quote>big river.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>When the <rs>Ohio</rs> had been crossed her young master met her, evidently to the great delight of the poor creature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>He gave her some money, and <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> told her that when she reached her destination he would send her some <quote>mo.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>After putting her in charge of some kind people, evidently representatives of the underground line, they had parted, according to her description of the incident, in an affecting way. <quote>He kissed me and I cried,</quote> was her simple statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Notwithstanding the boasted superiority of <num value="1">one</num> race over another, human nature seems to be very much the same, whether we read it in a white face or in a black <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>The little girlish mother was very much alarmed for the safety of her boy and herself when we began our journey, wanting to get out and conceal herself whenever we heard any <num value="1">one</num> on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>After several detentions from that cause, the weary creature stretched herself upon the hay beside her sleeping infant and almost immediately fell into a heavy slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>She could stand the strain no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>I drew the buffalo-robe over the <num value="2">two</num> sleepers, and there they rested in blissful unconsciousness until the journey was ended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>Half-way between the termini of my route was a village in which lived a constable who was suspected of being in the employ of the slave-owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>It was thought advisable that I should avoid that village by taking a roundabout road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>That I did, although it added an extra half to my trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>The result was that the sun was just peeping over the eastern hills, as I reached a set of bars showing an entrance into a pasture lot on <num value="1">one</num> side of the highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>Removing the bars, I drove into the field, and passing over a ridge that hid it from the road, I stopped in front of a log cabin that had every <pb id="p.127" n="127"/> appearance of being an abandoned and neglected homestead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>That was the station I was looking for. Arousing my sleeping passengers, I saw them enter the old domicile, where I bade them goodby, and received the tearful and repeated thanks of the youthful slave mother, speaking for herself and her offspring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>I never saw them again, but in due time the news came back, over what was jocularly called the <quote>grape-vine telegraph,</quote> that they had safely reached their destination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>At the home of the station agent I was enthusiastically received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>That a boy of <num value="11">eleven</num> should accomplish what I had done was thought to be quite wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>I was given an excellent breakfast, and then shown to a room with a bed, where I had a good sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>On my awakening I set out on the return journey, this time taking the most direct route, as I had then no fear of that hireling constable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>Subsequently I passed through several experiences of a similar kind, some of them involving greater risks and more exciting incidents, but the recollection of none of them brings me greater satisfaction than the memory of my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conductorship on the <name>Underground</name>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>I have had a good deal to say about Anti-Slavery societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>There was another society which was called into existence by the slavery situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>Whether it was pro-slavery or anti-slavery was a question that long puzzled a good many people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>It was the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>A good many Anti-Slavery people believed in it for a time and gave it their support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/><quote>I am opposed to slavery, but I am not an Abolitionist: I am a Colonizationist,</quote> was a declaration that, when I was a boy, I heard many and many times, and from the lips of well-intending people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>It did not take the sharp-sighted leaders of the <name>Abolition</name> movement very long to discover that <num value="1">one</num> of the uses its managers expected to make of the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName> was as a shield for slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>It kept a number of excellent people from joining in an aggressive movement against it, took their money, and made them believe that they were at work for the freedom of the negro.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>Strangely as it might appear, the negroes, who were assumed to be the beneficiaries of the colonization scheme, were opposed to it. Quicker than the white people generally did, they saw through its <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> false pretense, and, besides, they could not understand why they should be taken from the land of their nativity, and sent to the country from which their progenitors had come, any more than the descendants of <name>Scotch</name>, <name>English</name>, and <name>German</name> immigrants should be deported to the lands of their ancestors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>Equally strange was it that the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName>, if really friendly to the negro, should find its most zealous supporters among slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>Its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> president, who was a nephew of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0164.0018.00129.00340" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, upon learning that his slaves had got the idea that they were to be set at liberty, sent over <num value="50">fifty</num> of them to be sold from the auction block at New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>That was intended as a warning to the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/><num value="1">One</num> of its presidents was said to be the owner of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> slaves and had never manumitted <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>The principal service that the colonization movement was expected to do for the slave-owners was to relieve them of the presence of free negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>These were always regarded as a menace by slave-masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>They disseminated ideas of freedom and manhood among their unfortunate brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>They were object-lessons to those in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>The slave-owners were only too glad to have them sent away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>They looked to <placeName key="tgn,1000171" n="1.000 3" reg="liberia,africa">Liberia</placeName> as a safety-valve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>It did not take long for intelligent people who were really well-wishers of the black man to perceive these facts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>The severest blow that the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName> received in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> was from the pen of <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0164.0018.00129.00341" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, who, under the title of <hi rend="italics">Thoughts on African Colonization</hi>, published a pamphlet that had <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> wide distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>It completely unmasked the pretended friendship of the <name>Colonizationists</name> for the negroes, free or slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>From that time they lost all support from real Anti-Slavery people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>There was, however, to be a battle fought, in which the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName> figured as a party, that furnished <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting episodes of the slavery conflict.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>He did not hesitate to represent that the <orgName n="Colonization Society" type="society">Colonization Society</orgName> was the especial friend of the negro, working for his deliverance from bondage, and, in addition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>that it had the support of <quote>the wealth, the respectability, and the piety of the <rs>American</rs> people.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>When these facts came to the knowledge of the members of the newly formed <orgName n="New England Anti Slavery Society" type="society">New England Anti-Slavery Society</orgName>, they were naturally excited, and resolved to meet the enemy in this new field of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>This they decided to do by sending a representative to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, who would be able to meet the colonization agent in discussion, and otherwise proclaim and champion their particular views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>(See Appendix.) The explanation is that the proclamation was not intended to cover all slaveholding territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>All of it that belonged to States that had not been in rebellion, or had been subdued, was excluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s idea was to reach only such sections as were then in revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>If the proclamation had been immediately operative, and had liberated every bondman in the jurisdiction to which it applied, it would have left over a <num value="1000000">million</num> slaves in actual thraldom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>Indeed, <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, the <rs>British</rs> premier, was quite correct when, in speaking of the proclamation, he said: <quote>It does not more than profess to emancipate slaves where the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities cannot make emancipation a reality, and emancipates no <num value="1">one</num> where the decree can be carried into effect.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>For the failure of the proclamation to cover all slaveholding territory there was a plausible reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>Freedom under it was not decreed as a boon, but as a penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>It was not, in theory at least, intended to help the slave, but to chastise the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>It <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> was to be in punishment of treason, and, of course, could not consistently be made to apply to loyal communities, or to such as were under government control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>The proclamation, it will be recollected, was issued in <num value="2">two</num> parts separated by <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part gave the <rs>Rebels</rs> warning that the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> would follow if, in the meanwhile, they did not give up their rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>All they had to do to save slavery was to cease from their treasonable practices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>Had the <rs>Rebels</rs> been shrewd enough, within the <measure n="100days" type="date">hundred days</measure>, to take the <rs>President</rs> at his word, he would have stood pledged to maintain their institution, and his proclamation, instead of being a charter of freedom, would have been a license for slaveholding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>The proclamation did not, in fact, whatever it may have otherwise accomplished at the time it was issued, liberate a single slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>What is more, slavery as an institution was altogether too securely rooted in our system to be abolished by proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>The talk of such a thing greatly belittles the magnitude of the task that was performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Its removal required a long preliminary work, involving, as is made to appear in previous chapters of this work, almost incalculable toil and sacrifice, to be followed by an enormous expenditure of blood and treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>Its practical extinguishment was the work of the army, while its legal extirpation was accomplished by Congress and the <name>Legislatures</name> of the <name>States</name> in adopting the <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> Amendment to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, which forbids all slaveholding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>That amendment was a production of Congress and not of the <rs>Executive</rs>, whose official <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> approval was not even required to make it legally effective.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>The story of the proclamation, with not a few variations, has often been told; but the writer fancies that the altogether correct account has not always been given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>It may be presumptuous on his part, but he will submit his version.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>To understand the motive underlying the proclamation we must take into account its author's feeling toward slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>In effect he so declared in his introduction to his freedom proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>He gave the rebel slaveholders <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> in which to abandon their rebellion and save their institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>As a politician of great native shrewdness, as well as the head of the <rs>Government</rs>, he could not afford to let the quarrel go on and widen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>There was need of conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Something had to be done.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>As far as freeing any slaves was concerned, he knew it amounted to very little, if anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>He said so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>Slavery was a thing he did not then want to have disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>He discountenanced all radical agitators of the subject, and especially in the border slave States, where he was able to hold them pretty well in check, except in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>There they stood up and fought him, and in the end beat him. <num value="1">One</num> of the rather curious results of this condition of things was that, when the <name>States</name> came to action on the <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> Constitutional Amendment, the <num value="1">one</num> absolutely abolishing slavery, the <num value="3">three</num> border slave States of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Delaware" key="tgn,7007239">Delaware</placeName>, over which the <rs>President</rs>'s influence was practically supreme, gave an adverse vote of <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, while <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, with whose radical emancipationists he had continuously been at loggerheads, ratified the amendment by a <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> legislative vote of <num value="111">one hundred and eleven</num> ayes to <num value="40">forty</num> nays.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the <rs>President</rs>, at the beginning of his official term, opposed Anti-Slavery agitation and Anti-Slavery action with all his might, he promptly faced about as soon as he discovered that the subject was <num value="1">one</num> that would not <quote>down.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>No <num value="1">one</num> ever worked harder to find a solution of a difficult problem than he did of the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>He began to formulate plans to that end, the most distinguishing feature, however, being the spirit of compromise by which they were pervaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>All of them stopped before an ultimatum was reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>Besides his proclamation, which, as we have seen, applied to only a part of the slaves, he devised a measure that would have been applicable to all of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>In his special message of <dateStruct value="1863-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, he proposed to Congress the submission of a constitutional amendment that would work universal liberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>There were conditions, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/><num value="1">One</num> was that the slaves should be paid for by the <rs>Government</rs>; another that the masters might retain their uncompensated services until <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> i, <num value="90000">90000</num>; that is, for a period of <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty-seven years</measure>, unless they were sooner emancipated by the grave, as the most of them would be. (See Appendix.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s somewhat fantastic proposition was not claimed by him to be for the bondman's benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>He urged it as a measure of public economy, holding that, as slavery was the admitted cause of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, the quickest and surest way to remove that cause would be by purchase of all <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> the slaves, which, he insisted, <quote>would shorten the war, and thus lessen the expenditure of money and blood.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>The public did not take to the <rs>President</rs>'s plan at all, especially the <name>Abolitionists</name> did not. They no more favored the buying of men by the <rs>Government</rs> than by anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>They held that if the master had no right to the person of his bondman, he had no right to payment for him. And as for an arrangement that might prolong slaveholding for <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty-seven years</measure>, they saw in it not only a measure of injustice to the men, women, and children then in servitude, the most of whom would be doomed to bondage for the rest of their natural lives, but a possible plan for side-tracking a genuine freedom movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>In the proposition just considered we have not only the core of the <rs>President</rs>'s policy during much of his official tenure, but an explanation of his mental operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>He was sentimentally opposed to slavery, bat he was afraid of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>He dreaded its effect on both races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>He was opposed to slavery more because it was a public nuisance than because of its injustice to the oppressed black man, whose condition, he did not believe, would be greatly, if at all, benefited by freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>Hence he wanted manumission put off as long as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>It was <quote>ultimate extinction</quote> he wanted, to be attended with payment to the master for his lost property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>Another thing he favored-and which he seems to have thought entirely practicable &mdash; as a condition to liberation, was the black man's removal to a place or places out of contact with our white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/><pb id="p.146" n="146"/></p> 
<p>But in entire fairness to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0019.00146.00405" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, it should be said that, although his proclamation was inoperative for the immediate release of any slaves, it was by no means wholly ineffectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>Its moral influence was considerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>It helped to hasten a movement that had, however, by that time become practically irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>Its political results were far more marked and important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>If it did not fully restore cordiality between the <rs>President</rs> and the <name>Abolition</name> leaders, it prevented an open rupture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>It served as a bridge between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>Although they never took <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0019.00146.00406" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> fully into their confidence again, the <name>Abolitionists</name> interpreted his proclamation as a concession and an abandonment of his previous policy, which it was much more in appearance than actually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>At all events, it was splendid politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>The somewhat theatrical manner in which it was worked up and promulgated in installments, thus arousing in advance a widespread interest and curiosity, showed no little strategic ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>No more skillful move is recorded in the history of our parties and partisans than this act of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0019.00146.00407" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by which he disarmed his Anti-Slavery critics without giving them any material advantage or changing the actual situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>I am not now speaking of the motive underlying the proclamation of the <rs>President</rs>, but of its effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>Without it he could not have been renominated and re-elected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Another observation, in order to be entirely just to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0019.00146.00408" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, after what has been stated, would at this point seem to be called for. There is no doubt that from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he was at heart an Anti-Slavery man, which is saying a good deal for <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> born in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, raised in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">southern</rs> Illinois</placeName>, and who was naturally of a conservative turn of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>Nevertheless, he was never an Abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>He was opposed to immediate-what he called <quote>sudden</quote> --emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>He recognized the <quote>right</quote> --his own word &mdash; of the slave-owner to his pound of flesh, either in the person of his bondman or a cash equivalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>He was strongly prejudiced against the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>Of that fact we have the evidence in his colonization ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>He favored the banishment of our American-born black people from their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>It was a cruel proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>True, the <rs>President</rs> did move from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position, which, as we have seen, was far from that occupied by the <name>Abolitionists</name>, but from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last he was more of a follower than leader in the procession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>And here the author wishes to add, in justice to himself, that if, by reason of anything he has said in this chapter, or elsewhere in this work, in criticism of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0019.00147.00409" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s dealings with the slavery issue, he should be accused of unfriendliness toward the great martyr <rs type="role2">President</rs>, he enters a full and strong denial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>He holds that, in view of all the difficulties besetting him, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0019.00147.00410" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> did well, although he might have done better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>Much allowance, must be made to <num value="1">one</num> situated as he was. He undoubtedly deserves the most of the encomiums that have been lavished upon him. At the same time, the conclusion is inevitable that his fame as a statesman will ultimately depend less upon his treatment of the slavery issue than upon any other part of his public administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>The fact will <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> always appear that it was the policy of <persName n="Chase,,Salmon,P.,," id="n0164.0019.00148.00411" reg="expanded:Chase,Salmon,Portland,,"><foreName>Salmon</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0164.0019.00148.00412" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stevens,,Thaddeus,,," id="n0164.0019.00148.00413" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0164.0019.00148.00414" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beecher,,Henry,Ward,," id="n0164.0019.00148.00415" reg="default:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Ward</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>, and other advocates of the radical cure, with whom the <rs>President</rs> was in constant opposition, that prevailed in the end, and with a decisiveness that proves it to have been feasible and sound from the beginning.

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="19" n="XIX"><num value="19">19</num></num>: the end of Abolitionism</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>The original and distinctive Abolition movement that was directed against slavery in all parts of the land without regard to State or territorial lines, and because it was assumed to be wrong in principle and practice, may be said, as far as the country at large was concerned, to have culminated at the advent of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>To a considerable extent it disappeared, but its disappearance was that of <num value="1">one</num> stream flowing into or uniting with another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>The union of the <num value="2">two</num> currents extended, but did not intensify, the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery sentiment of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>It diluted it and really weakened it. It brought about a crisis of great peril to the cause of Anti-Slaveryism &mdash; in some respects the most critical through which it was called upon to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>Many of those attaching themselves to the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, as the new political organization was called, were not in sympathy with Abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>They were utterly opposed to immediate emancipation; or, for that matter, to emancipation of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>They wanted slavery to remain where it was, and were perfectly willing that it should be undisturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>They disliked the blacks, and did not want to have them freed, fearing that if set at liberty they would overrun what was then free soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/><pb id="p.151" n="151"/></p> 
<p>The writer recollects hearing a prominent man in the new party, who about that time was making a public speech, declare with great emphasis that, <quote>as for the niggers, they are where they ought to be.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>The speaker on that occasion was <num value="1">one</num> of many who belonged to the <hi rend="italics">debris</hi> of the broken &mdash; up <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">Whig party</orgName>, and who drifted into Republicanism because there was no other more attractive harbor to go to. <num value="1">One</num> of these men was <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0164.0020.00151.00420" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, whom I heard declare in his debate with <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00151.00421" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:3"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton, Illinois</placeName>: <quote>I was with the old-line Whigs from the origin to the end of their party.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>The Whigs were never an Anti-Slavery party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>The recruits to Republicanism from that quarter were generally very tender on <quote>the nigger question,</quote> and the most they were prepared to admit was that they were opposed to slavery's extension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>These men largely dominated the new party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>They generally dictated its platforms, which, compared with earlier Abolition utterances, were extremely timid, and they had much to do with making party nominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>Their favorite candidates were not those whose opinions on the slavery question were positive and well understood, but those whose views were unsettled if not altogether unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>When <persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n0164.0020.00151.00422" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName> was nominated for the <name>Presidency</name>, not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="10">ten</num> of those supporting him knew what his opinions on that subject were, and a good many of them did not care.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>It is true that, from certain expressions about the danger to our national house from being <quote>half free</quote> and <quote>half slave,</quote> and other generalizations <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> of a more or less academic sort, it was known that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0020.00152.00424" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was antagonistic to slavery; but as to whether he favored that institution's immediate or speedy extinguishment, and, if so, by what measures, was altogether unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>We now know, from what has been set forth in another chapter, that at the time of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> nomination and election, he had very few things in common with the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>He then evidently had no thought of being hailed as the <quote>liberator of a race.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>He preferred, for the time at least, that the race in question should remain where it was, and as it was, unless it could be bodily transported to some other country and be put under the protection of some other flag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>He did not break with the <name>Abolitionists</name>, although he kept on the edge of a quarrel with them, and especially with what he called the <quote><persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00152.00425" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> faction,</quote> a good part of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>He never liked them, but he was a shrewd man &mdash; a born politician-and was too sagacious to discard the principal round in the ladder by which he had climbed to eminence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>He managed to keep in touch with the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery movement through all its steady advancement, but, as elsewhere stated, it was as a follower rather than as a leader.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>While a resident of the slave <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">State of Missouri</placeName>, I twice voted for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0020.00152.00426" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, which was some evidence of my personal feeling toward him. Both times I did it somewhat reluctantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> occasion there were <num value="4">four</num> candidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>But with <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00152.00429" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:3"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> the case was different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/><pb id="p.153" n="153"/> He had quarreled with the pro-slavery leaders, although of his own party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>He had defied <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00430" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> in denouncing border-ruffianism in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>He had refused to give up his <quote>popular sovereignty</quote> dogma, although it clearly meant ultimate free soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>The slave-masters hated him far more than they did <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00431" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>I heard them freely discuss the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>They were more afraid of the vindictiveness of the fiery <rs>Douglas</rs> than of the opposition of good-hearted, conservative <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00432" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>In my opinion there was good reason for that feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/><persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00433" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:3"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>, as <rs type="role2">President</rs>, would undoubtedly have pushed the war for the <rs>Union</rs> with superior energy, and slavery would have suffered rougher treatment from his hands than it did from <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00434" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s. There was another reason why the slaveholders preferred the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00435" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to that of <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00436" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:3"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>They were resolved to defeat <persName n="Douglas,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00438" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,Stephen,A.,,:3"><surname>Douglas</surname></persName> at all hazards, and they succeeded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>They called him a <quote>dough &mdash; face.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>Nevertheless, quite a number of them where I lived in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> voted for him. <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was the only State he carried, and there he had less than <num value="500">five hundred</num> majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>He got more than that many free-soil votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>I was strongly tempted to give him mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>Chiefly on account of political associations, I voted for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00440" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>When it came to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> election, I again voted for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0164.0020.00153.00441" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> with reluctance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>The principal <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> reason for my hesitancy was his treatment of the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery people of the border slave States, and especially of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>The grounds for my objection on that score will appear in the next chapter, which deals with the <rs>Missouri</rs> embroglio, as it was called.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>From what has just been stated, it will be seen that the cause of Anti-Slaveryism had, at the formation of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, reached a most perilous crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>It was in danger of being submerged and suffocated by unsympathetic, if not positively unfriendly, associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>It ran the risk, after so many years of toil and conflict, of being undone by those in whose support it was forced to confide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>Such would undoubtedly have been its fate if, owing to circumstances over which no <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> or other organization of men had control, the current of Anti-Slavery sentiment had not risen to a flood that swept all before it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>It is rather a curious circumstance that, at the crisis just alluded to, the nearest approach to original Abolitionism that was to be found, was in a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 71" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> there was an organized opposition to slavery that had been maintained for several years, and which was never abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>The vitality displayed by this movement was undoubtedly due in large measure to the inspiration of the man who was its originator, if not its leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>That man was <persName n="Benton,,Thomas,H.,," id="n0164.0020.00154.00442" reg="default:Benton,Thomas,H.,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Benton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>Whether <persName n="Benton,,,,," id="n0164.0020.00154.00443" reg="nearbymention:Benton,Thomas,H.,,"><surname>Benton</surname></persName> was ever an Abolitionist or not, has been a much-disputed question, but <num value="1">one</num> thing is certain, and that is that the men who sat at his feet, who were his closest disciples and imbibed the most of his spirit-such as <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> <persName n="Brown,,B.,Gratz,," id="n0164.0020.00155.00444" reg="default:Brown,B.,Gratz,,"><foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>Gratz</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, John How, the <name>Blairs</name>, the <name>Filleys</name>, and other influential Missourians,--were Abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>Some of them weakened under the influence of the national administration, but not a few of them maintained their integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>Even in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, when all was chaos there, an organization was maintained, although at <num value="1">one</num> time its only working and visible representatives consisted of the members of a committee of <num value="4">four</num> men --<num value="0.2">a <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num></num> having withdrawn &mdash; who were <persName n="Brown,,B.,Gratz,," id="n0164.0020.00155.00445" reg="default:Brown,B.,Gratz,,"><foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>Gratz</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, afterwards a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>; <persName n="Fletcher,,Thomas,C.,," id="n0164.0020.00155.00446" reg="default:Fletcher,Thomas,C.,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Fletcher</surname></persName>, afterwards <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>; <persName n="Bonner,the Honorable,Benjamin,R.,," id="n0164.0020.00155.00447" reg="default:Bonner,Benjamin,R.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Bonner</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, and the writer of this narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>They issued an appeal that was distributed all over the <rs>State</rs>, asking those in sympathy with their views to hold fast to their principles, and to keep up the contest for unconditional freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>To that appeal there was an encouraging number of favorable responses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>And thus it was that when Abolitionism may be said to have been lost by merger elsewhere, it remained in its independence and integrity in slaveholding <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, where it kept up a struggle for free soil, and in <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> so far made itself master of the situation that a constitutional <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State convention</orgName>, chosen by popular vote, adopted an ordinance under which an emancipationist Governor issued his proclamation, declaring that <quote>hence and forever no person within the jurisdiction of the <rs>State</rs> shall be subject to any abridgment of liberty, except such as the law shall prescribe for the common good, or know any master but <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>That manifestation, he thinks, is deserving of recognition, both on its own account and as a continuation of the original movement, and he is the more inclined to contribute to its discussion because he was then a Missourian by residence, and had something to do with its successful prosecution. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>He believes no man in this country was made the victim of greater injustice than he was.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2070"/>He could not tolerate the idea of a newcomer pre-empting what he had considered his premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>If he could not rule he was ready to ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>That disposition accorded with both his mental and physical make-up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>Bodily he was a bundle of bones and nerves without a particle of surplus flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/>His hair was red, his complexion was sandy, and his eyes, when he was excited and angry, had a baleful expression that led some <num value="1">one</num> in my presence on a certain occasion to speak of them as <quote>brush-heaps afire.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>He was not an eloquent man, although a ready and frequent public speaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>His voice was not musical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>His strong forte was invective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>He was nearly always denouncing somebody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>Apparently, he was never so happy as when making another miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>Sometimes his personal allusions were very broad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>That he was not almost all the time in personal difficulties was due to the fact that he was known to be a man of exceptional courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>He was a born fighter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>I have spoken of the <rs type="place">Camp Jackson</rs> affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>Although the people in the <rs>Rebel</rs> encampment surrendered <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> without a blow, the incident was attended with considerable bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>A mob of Rebel sympathizers, consisting largely of half-grown boys-I was in the midst of the throng at the time-with their pistols opened fire on a German Union regiment and killed several of its men. The troops, in return, poured a volley into the crowd of spectators from which the shots had come, killing or wounding over <num value="40">forty</num> persons, the most of them, as is usual in such cases, being inoffensive onlookers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>A man standing beside me and, like myself, a spectator, had the top of <num value="1">one</num> ear clipped off by a Mini6 ball as cleanly as if it had been done with a knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/>I found when, soon afterwards, I reached the business center of the city, where the <rs>Rebel</rs> element then largely predominated, that the story of the tragedy had swelled the number of the victims to <num value="1000">one thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>Intense excitement and the most furious indignation prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>Hundreds of men, with flaming faces, were swearing the most dreadful oaths that they would shoot <persName n="Blair,,Frank,,," id="n0164.0023.00190.00612" reg="default:Blair,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName>, whom they seemed to regard as wholly responsible, on sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>Many of them were flourishing pistols in confirmation of their bloody purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>No better target could have been offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>I watched the audacious man, expecting to hear a shot at any moment from the sidewalk, or from a window of <num value="1">one</num> of the high buildings lining the street, and to see him topple from his saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>He understood very well the danger he was braving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>He knew that in that throng, where everybody was armed, there were hundreds toying with the triggers of their guns, and trying to muster sufficient courage to shoot him down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>Slowly, and as calmly as if on ordinary dress parade, he led the way until he passed out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>I thought then, and still think, it was the pluckiest thing I ever witnessed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>Of course, they were violently opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>Mobs broke up their meetings very frequently, but that only made them more persistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>Their teachings were viciously misrepresented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>They were accused of favoring the intermarriage of the races, and parents were warned, if they sent their children to <placeName key="tgn,7014255" n="1.000 28" reg="oberlin, lorain, ohio">Oberlin</placeName>, to look out for colored sons-in-law and daughters-in-law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>There he met a lady who owned a valuable plantation well stocked with healthy negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>He married the woman, and became something of a local nabob, with the reputation of great severity as a master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>My uncle and father did not conceal their unpopular views.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>All Abolition lecturers and colporteurs were gratuitously entertained, although their presence was sometimes a cause of abuse, and even of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>There were other travelers who sometimes applied for help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>Their faces were of dusky hue, and their great whitish eyes were like those of hunted beasts of the forest.
