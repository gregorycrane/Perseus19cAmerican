<head>Introduction</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Soon after the close of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, <persName n="Sleeper,Major,J.,Henry,," id="n0245.0001.00005.00001" reg="expanded:Sleeper,Jacob,Henry,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Sleeper</surname></persName>, for his own information and enjoyment, obtained permission from the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">U. S. A.</placeName>, to have an exact copy of the <rs>Morning Report Book</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="10MABattery">Tenth Massachusetts Battery</orgName> made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>For various reasons the historian of the company in preparing its history some years since made but slight use of this book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The lapse of time has shown the survivors of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> that this omission on the part of their historian was a mistake; that many of them could have been materially aided in establishing their claims for a pension had these records been available, and that other historical material omitted should have found place in the volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Acting on this idea at the last meeting of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> Association a committee was chosen, consisting of <persName n="Billings,,John,D.,," id="n0245.0001.00005.00002" reg="default:Billings,John,D.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Billings</surname></persName>, <persName n="Green,Major,Milbrey,,," id="n0245.0001.00005.00003" reg="default:Green,Milbrey,,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <foreName>Milbrey</foreName> <surname>Green</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pierce,Lieutenant,Charles,E.,," id="n0245.0001.00005.00004" reg="default:Pierce,Charles,E.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName> and given full power to print the contents of the <rs>Morning Report Book</rs> with such other valuable historical material as seemed desirable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>That committee, after careful deliberation, decided it to be the part of wisdom to publish these Morning Reports, adding to them the history written many years ago carefully revised and corrected with its roster made accurate and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The committee also voted to include in the volume such portraits of members as can now be obtained and as many camp and battlefield sketches as are available, with a mortuary list to date, thus embracing compactly the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>'s story as full and complete as it can now ever be told and more complete than most of the stories that have been written.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>No attempt has been made to correct orthography or supply omissions in the records of the <rs>Morning Reports</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>They are reproduced as written (save the daily reports of the number of men and horses present which are omitted.) A few hiatuses in the narrative are due to the breaking off of pieces of the leaves in using, the book having been reduced to tinder in the safe of <persName n="Sleeper,Major,,,," id="n0245.0001.00005.00005" reg="nearbymention:Sleeper,J.,Henry,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Sleeper</surname></persName> during the great <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 4" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName> fire of <dateStruct value="1871--"><year reg="1871">1871</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The work of compilation, composition, and correction, though approved by the whole committee, was devolved on <num value="1">one</num> who hereby assumes all responsibility for whatever faults the volume shall be found to have.

<head>Preface</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>At the close of the war in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Apthorp,,John,P.,," id="n0245.0002.00007.00006" reg="default:Apthorp,John,P.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Apthorp</surname></persName>, a member of the <rs>Company</rs> whose story is herein narrated, prepared for publication a manuscript history which he had designed to print In the autumn of that year; but when the work was complete, and his canvass of the members for subscriptions had been made, their response was so limited and inadequate to the outlay necessary for its issue that he abandoned the enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>That manuscript was made the basis of the present work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>About <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> since it came into my hands by the courtesy of its author, with the object, on my part, of joining with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other members of the <rs>Company</rs> in assuming the expense of its publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But a careful reading of it led us to the unanimous conclusion that thorough revision was necessary before doing so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reunion of the <rs>Company</rs>, held in <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 4" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1879-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1879">1879</year></dateStruct>, a committee on history was appointed, consisting of <persName n="Endicott,,William,E.,," id="n0245.0002.00007.00007" reg="default:Endicott,William,E.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Endicott</surname></persName> and myself, to be joined by such others as we might designate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For obvious reasons most of the labor necessary in its preparation was devolved upon <num value="1">one</num> individual; and that <num value="1">one</num> hereby releases all others from responsibility for its faults.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In proper relation to the story of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> it has seemed desirable to incorporate so much of the history of brigades, divisions, corps or the army as shall serve to show members of the company causes and results of movements and campaigns which, at the time of their occurrence, were little understood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>My information in relation to the detailed history of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> not derived from the above manuscript was taken in large measure from my personal diary, and an almost unbroken series of nearly <num value="300">three hundred</num> letters written home during our term of service.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In the prosecution of my researches, I have examined a large mass of war material, and have sought information by correspondence from commanders or eye-witnesses on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I am also indebted to the past officers who have contributed their portraits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>With this introduction I now submit this volume to my surviving comrades and their friends, hoping that they will find enough of interest and value in its pages to make them lenient towards its defects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If they fail to do this no <num value="1">one</num> will more sincerely regret it than their friend</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>On the morning of that day, about a <num value="100">hundred</num> men assembled at the <orgName n="Eastern Railroad" type="railroad">Eastern Railway</orgName> Station in <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 4" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>we formed line and went on board a train standing near to receive us, bound for <placeName key="tgn,2050046" n="1.000 14" reg="lynnfield, essex county, massachusetts">Lynnfield</placeName>, at that time <num value="1">one</num> of the rendezvouses established for the reception of regiments and companies prior to their departure for the seat of war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>While s<persName n="ZZZ,,,,," id="n0245.0003.00019.00031" reg="mostcommon:ZZZ,nomatch:0"><surname>ZZZ</surname></persName> <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> ers and seamen, blacksmiths and tailors, carpenters and teamsters, clerks fresh from the pen or yardstick, teachers, hard-handed laborers, policemen and restaurant keepers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>All these, with men of various other callings, combined to make up a motley collection of tastes, interests and prejudices, such as war always assembles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But all these differences of calling and taste were to be sunk in a common unity of purpose and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Henceforth we should know each other as soldiers and soldiers only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>While we were getting, acquainted the train moved on and in due time arrived at <placeName key="tgn,2050046" n="1.000 14" reg="lynnfield, essex county, massachusetts">Lynnfield</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Here those whose duty it was to provide accommodations had nothing ready, thus giving us our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lesson in patient waiting, a lesson which soldiers have to learn early and practise long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There was the camp, it is true; but it was surrounded by sentries, armed with rusty muskets, whose valor we did not care to test by trespassing on their beat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>While waiting outside the lines, a heavy shower came up, and we concluded, while hugging the lee side of contiguous buildings and becoming drenched to the skin, that we were having a fair initiation into the experiences of a soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Sunshine again appearing, our prospects brightened materially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>A company of <num value="1">one</num> of the regiments in camp, going away on furlough, vacated its quarters for us. These consisted of <num value="2">two</num> rows of tents, known interchangeably by the names of <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n0245.0003.00020.00032" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,nomatch:0"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> and Bell Tents; the former derived from the name of the inventor, the latter given from their resemblance to huge bells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They were pitched in <num value="2">two</num> rows of <num value="6">six</num> each, with a park between about <num value="4">four</num> rods wide, at the head of which stood <num value="2">two</num> wall tents occupied by the officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>These tents, located by themselves near a pleasant <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> piece of woods, formed a more inviting camp than had been anticipated, and we were not long in accommodating ourselves to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Those who had been familiar with the culinary art took possession of the cook-house that stood near by, and in due time were dealing out tin dippers of black coffee and slices of bread, thus introducing us to the simple fare of army life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Supper disposed of, we examined the interior of the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>They were found to be supported by a central pole resting on an iron tripod.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>A plentiful supply of straw covered the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>On this a dozen men in each stretched themselves, feet to the centre, and passed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night, not in slumber, but in telling stories and shivering in the chill night air. The next day was the <name>Sabbath</name>, and camp life began in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The guard, hemming us in on all sides, was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rather chafing to free American citizens, but we accepted it as an annoyance inseparable from the service into which we had voluntarily entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Some of us were detailed for guard around our own camp, while others went as supernumeraries to relieve the regular sentries at the central guard-house, and whiled away the hours in watching over certain wayward and drunken soldiers from the infantry near us, whose ambitious propensities to beat the guard over the head with a club, bite off the fingers of the corporal who remonstrated, and divers other offences against law and decency, had consigned them to confinement in the stall of an old stable, now dignified by the name of guard-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>So, in <num value="1">one</num> way and another, we were inducted to our new employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>During the week our uniforms arrived, and with many jokes on the good clothes furnished us, we doffed the garb of civil life, and donning the uniform of light artillerymen, <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> became genuine soldiers in appearance so far as uniformity of dress could make us so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>This pleasant camp, however, was not destined to be our home long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In a few days a portion of the troops encamped with us were ordered to the seat of war, and those remaining were to be removed to <placeName key="tgn,2049501" n="1.000 10" reg="boxford, essex county, massachusetts">Boxford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>So, packing up our effects and getting down to the station promptly at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the morning, according to orders, we were fairly seated in the cars by <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> in the afternoon, and under way at sundown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>After several hours ride, during which the train had the singular faculty of going backwards as much as forwards, and standing still more than it did either, we were landed in <placeName key="tgn,2049501" n="1.000 10" reg="boxford, essex county, massachusetts">Boxford</placeName> about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> at night, to find the ground soaked with rain, and the beans that had been stewed for our supper by an advance guard, sour as vinegar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>While some of the men were striving to make themselves comfortable for the remainder of the night in the cars, which had been left standing near the camp-ground, a voice came ringing through the train: <q direct="unspecified">Any of <persName n="Garlic,Captain,,,," id="n0245.0003.00022.00033" reg="mostcommon:Garlic,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Garlic</surname></persName>'s men here?</q><note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> 
<p>A captain in the <orgName type="regiment" key="40MAInfantry">40th Massachusetts infantry</orgName>.</p></note> Again and yet again was it repeated in anxious tones at every door, although greeted with the jeers and execrations of the would-be slumberers within; but the captain with the fragrant name seemed to think his reputation as a soldier depended on immediately gathering all his flock under his sheltering care, as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings; for when some of us left the cars for fresh air without, before we had fairly touched the ground, the same inquiry concerning the whereabouts of <persName n="Garlic,Captain,,,," id="n0245.0003.00022.00034" reg="mostcommon:Garlic,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Garlic</surname></persName>'s flock assailed us. We sought boxes and boards on which to sleep raised from the wet ground, and were just dropping off into dreamland <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> when a gentle touch on the shoulder drove us well-nigh frantic, followed as it was by the same disgusting inquiry, and we then and there wished the whole <persName n="Garlic,,,,," id="n0245.0003.00023.00035" reg="mostcommon:Garlic,nomatch:0"><surname>Garlic</surname></persName> clan and all its satellites, present or prospective, were in the sunny <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Some even gave him and his men direct marching orders to the fervid heats of a less favored clime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>At last the interrogatory ceased, and we passed what little remained of the night in comparative quiet; but whether the indefatigable captain ever succeeded in collecting his truant flock, or found any end to his restless search, we never knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In the morning <placeName reg="Camp Stanton">Camp Stanton</placeName> was established at <placeName key="tgn,2049501" n="1.000 10" reg="boxford, essex county, massachusetts">Boxford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Here we pitched our tents and remained about <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, changing our location once during our stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>On the <dateStruct value="-09-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> we were mustered into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by <persName n="Elder,Lieutenant,M.,,," id="n0245.0003.00023.00036" reg="default:Elder,M.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Elder</surname></persName> of the regular army, and received <num value="1">one</num> month's pay in advance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>There were brave struggles made to appear calm, but the tears would come, and as the train moved away, the last view of a wife or mother to some, was a frantic gesture of the hand and streaming eyes that told how great the sacrifice to those who must stay at home and wait.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>With this outfit for active service came fresh batches of rumors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The <num value="9" type="ordinal">Ninth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="11MABattery">Eleventh Massachusetts batteries</orgName> had left <placeName reg="Camp Barry">Camp Barry</placeName> for parts unknown, and we should probably go next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>This prospect of a change was not wholly displeasing to us, for, although we were not anxious to go to <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, we <hi rend="italics">were</hi> desirous of leaving the brigade, as it was under the charge of a man who had the faculty of accomplishing the smallest amount of service with the greatest amount of inconvenience to the men under his control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>In his discipline he was a most rigid martinet and exacted unflinching obedience to disgusting requirements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The neighborhood of his headquarters was disgraced daily by the presence of victims undergoing his varied and villanous tortures; in short, his love of display, his absurd regulations, an undue parade of his <q direct="unspecified">brief authority,</q> and his outrageously <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> severe punishments of trivial offences, caused the name of <persName n="Munroe,Major,,,," id="n0245.0005.00044.00126" reg="mostcommon:Munroe,Frank,A.,,:3"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Munroe</surname></persName> to be execrated by all soldiers who were ever so unfortunate as to come under the dominion of this small-souled officer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We have not forgotten in this connection that the constraints of military service were yet new to us, and that in consequence we bore the exactions it permitted with less patience than afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Nevertheless, looking back through our entire term of service, it is our calm, deliberate conviction, sustained by the judgments of history, that the war was greatly prolonged, the loss of life much increased, and the service in many other ways suffered material detriment, by the appointment of officers morally and intellectually unfit for their positions, to whom love and justice, the very foundation principles of all lasting control over men, seemed entirely unknown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>But whatever drawbacks the discipline of <placeName reg="Camp Barry">Camp Barry</placeName> interposed to our happiness as individuals, it must be admitted (not, however, as in any way due to the management of the <rs>Post Commander</rs>) that we became good soldiers here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The frequent and vigorous drills of our efficient <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> made us, on the authority of a no less competent judge than <persName n="Barry,General,,,," id="n0245.0005.00044.00127" reg="mostcommon:Barry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Barry</surname></persName> himself, accomplished as artillerists, and of this education we were reasonably proud.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>In the earlier part of our sojourn here it was decided to build a stable large enough to accommodate <dateStruct value="800"><year reg="800">eight hundred</year></dateStruct> horses, and details of men for this purpose from the various batteries then in the brigade were ordered to report to <persName n="Stowell,,David,R.,," id="n0245.0005.00044.00129" reg="default:Stowell,David,R.,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Stowell</surname></persName>, our artificer, who was to have charge of its construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/><pb id="p.45" n="45"/> A violent rain-storm and wind threw down the stables when only partly finished; but they were afterwards carried on to successful completion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>As we were told there would be an extra allowance of <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> per day made for our labor, we looked upon the enterprise as something desirable, especially as it exempted us from all camp duties; but as the wages expected never came to hand, the question of interest to the detail from the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> afterwards was, why not?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The amount of baggage we could take was necessarily limited, and such a selection should be made as would result only in the <q direct="unspecified">survival of the fittest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>any little knick-knacks sent from home must be left behind, or in some inconceivable way taken along; and this experience was repeated over and over again in our subsequent history, more especially when about to leave winter-quarters.

<p>After buying a plentiful supply of the biscuits we allow him to go and peddle his wares through the camp, knowing that in every tent he will receive a warm welcome, and finally depart with an empty basket and heavier purse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>As <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> advanced the weather became still more inclement, confining us quite closely to the tents, and enforcing an amount of leisure that gave opportunity for an abundance of grumbling&mdash;that time-honored prerogative of the soldier.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The long continued absence of the paymaster, whom we had not seen since our departure from home, was the theme of frequent speculation and the source of much of the grumbling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Our food, too, was not always of the most appetizing kind, and when, on being supplied with flour, we, in the simplicity of our hearts, traded it at the bakery in the town for bread, judge of our dismay on being informed that we had committed a crime of whose enormity we could be little aware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>We might cook the flour ourselves (an easy task without stoves or ovens!), or we might hire it cooked, (another easy task with our pay nearly <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> in arrears!), or we might leave it undrawn and allow its value to accumulate in that mysterious investment known as the <hi rend="italics">Company Fund</hi>,&mdash;a bourne from whence no profits ever returned, certainly not to the members of the <orgName type="regiment" key="10MABattery">Tenth Massachusetts Battery</orgName>, and whose unwritten history would make entertaining reading,&mdash; but to swap it off for bread was a heinous offence indeed; and in the interest of the <hi rend="italics">Fund</hi>, whose amount was to be divided at the end of the war, so much per capita coming as a kind of endowment, the swapping should cease.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The scarcity of tobacco, through the absence of its purchasing power, acted on the nerves of some; and the slow progress of the war spread a gloom over others, who were ready to make common cause with the copperheads in their discussions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>There was probably more downright grumbling in our camps at <placeName reg="Poolsville">Poolsville</placeName> than during our entire subsequent experience, when greater hardships had begotten a spirit of greater patience, and when we had become more accustomed to the constraints that military service entails.

<p>But this winter of our discontent was by no means devoid of enlivening scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Sometimes, when the beef known as <q direct="unspecified">salt horse,</q> served out to us for dinner, was extremely unsavory, straightway a bier was improvised from a hard-tack box, the remains of the poor horse laid thereon in state, and a worn-out currycomb or a dilapidated bridle placed beside it as appropriate insignia of rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The whole was then borne off in solemn procession to the mournful music of a jews-harp and <num value="2">two</num> cracked bugles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The cortege in its passage through the camp received numerous accessions from those anxious to do honor to the fallen hero, and the remains, having been carried to the sink, were consigned to their last resting-place and a volley of pistols fired over the grave.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The inhabitants of this neighborhood had done their part to bring on the war, and now it was simply just that they should help feed the soldiers who must carry it on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of these midnight forays, which a reckless sergeant of the guard led in person, he having communicated the general countersign to his entire party, quite a commotion was excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/><num value="1">One</num> of his select body was the <name>Guidon</name>, whose tendency to <hi rend="italics">em</hi>-<pb id="p.59" n="59"/> <hi rend="italics">bon-point</hi> showed conclusively to those who knew him most intimately, that nothing but an intense love of good living had enlisted his interest; for although an urbane gentleman, an accomplished knight of the quill, and an expert at cribbage and euchre, his comrades always expected him to do the ornamental part when any detail was made for fatigue duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>On this particular occasion it seems a flock of sheep was the object of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>As soon as the raiders came upon them in the darkness, naturally enough they cantered away, and equally natural was it that their adversaries should pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>This they at once did, and foremost in the van was the <name>Guidon</name>, who led off with an impetuosity rarely equalled and truly surprising; but the sheep were more accustomed to this kind of business than he was and seemed to be gaining on him. This was too much for the equanimity of the gallant color-bearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>In his mind's eye he had already made a savory repast off <num value="1">one</num> of them,&mdash;had scented the delicious odors from broiling chops,&mdash; had buried his knife deep in a hind-quarter roasted and done to a turn by <q direct="unspecified">Black <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>,</q>&mdash;and now to be cheated out of his prey was too much to expect of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He draws his revolver and dashes forward with renewed determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>His blood is fully up, and as he nears the flock he empties at least <measure n="3barrels" type="mass">three barrels</measure> among them, which appears to result in no bodily injury to the sheep, but calls down the maledictions of the sergeant on his head for his indiscretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>This in a few moments becomes apparent, for the fire of the pickets is drawn, the <orgName n="Long Roll" type="newspaper">Long Roll</orgName> is sounded, and the infantry turned out to repel an expected attack, the shots by the <name>Guidon</name> having been supposed to be from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The marauders skulked back to camp by the quickest route, <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> bringing with them <num value="3">three</num> sheep that had been quietly captured by the other members of the party; but no <num value="1">one</num>, outside of a small interested number in the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, ever knew the cause of all the tumult in camp that night, and, so far as can be ascertained, it was the final appearance of the <name>Guidon</name> in the role of a raider.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Rumors of enemies hovering near, suspected plans of the citizens to capture our camp by a sudden night attack, and the large number of prisoners brought in by the cavalry pickets, caused increased watchfulness and excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>We enter into conversation with him, and derive the usual slight amount of satisfaction from his answers to our inquiries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Every sentence is mysterious and indefinite, and winds up with a round guffaw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>The scattered companies of the infantry regiments that had been out at various points on picket were called in, and our brigade received orders to be ready to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>All our tents and superfluous camp equipage were turned over to the quartermaster to be sent to the rear, our personal baggage reduced to the smallest possible limit, then stowed in our knapsacks, now not quite as distended as when we left <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>As we turn in retrospect upon our sojourn here, removed from the occurrence by a lapse of so many years, there are thoughts which present themselves perhaps not unworthy of noting down in passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>And <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, with regard to our bodily comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Those of us who were fortunate enough to keep off the sick-list underwent no privations worthy of mention save absence from our families, which was of course inseparable from the nature of the case; and those who were seriously sick were at once removed to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 23" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, where good nursing and medical attendance were always to be had. <persName n="Child,Doctor,,,," id="n0245.0006.00072.00240" reg="mostcommon:Child,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VT10">Tenth Vermont</orgName>, was the brigade surgeon, and, so far as we know, was competent &mdash; in his calling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>Our living was, in the main, good enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>It was not what we were accustomed to at home, and very <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> properly should not have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>On the other hand, many of the men who grumbled loudest and were the daintiest, in all probability lived no better before their enlistment, and perhaps have not since their discharge, than they lived during their <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> stay here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>We are making no apology for the animated hard-tack, or stale beef that was too frequently served out to us; but taking a broad and dispassionate survey of the whole field, it is our candid conviction that the <rs>Company</rs> was not badly served in the matter of rations, on the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>We did believe, however, and with good reason as we still think, that inasmuch as the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> did not use all its allowances, a large surplus had or ought to have accumulated in the <rs>Company Fund</rs>, already mentioned; and this should have been properly accounted for, and ultimately inured in some manner to the benefit of the <rs>Company</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>This being the case, we do not know how much better we might have been served under proper management, and hence a foothold is made for the complaint of unjust administration in the department of subsistence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The disposition to improve our bill of fare at the expense of neighboring farm-yards seemed to have died out with our departure from <placeName reg="Camp Davis">Camp Davis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>A more extended familiarity with the adjacent territory, and, as a consequence, a better acquaintance with the people, who, although secessionists, appeared more like human beings than we had believed it possible for Rebels to do, had made us somewhat more merciful to their effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>And again, whether we condemn or approve the character of the government rations furnished us, there was certainly a very perceptible increase in the pounds avoirdupois of a large portion of the <rs>Company</rs>, whose daily routine may be fairly stated as <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> follows: breakfast, sleep, drill; dinner, sleep, drill; supper, sleep;&mdash;the result of which was a condition of body and mind positively antagonistic to tiresome raids over fences, fields, and ditches in the darkness, and in the uncertain and sometimes dangerous pursuit of <hi rend="italics">special</hi> rations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Our living was at times obtained quite independently of the government, by means of the boxes from home, that were received with greater or less frequency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>These were always inspected at headquarters before they came into our possession, and all contraband articles, in the line of liquors, confiscated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>This seemed <num value="1">one</num> of the singular anomalies of the war, that intoxicants were regarded a dangerous indulgence for the private soldier, who, in comparison had no responsibility, but the correct thing for the commissioned officer, upon whom devolved <hi rend="italics">every</hi> responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>Could this state of affairs have been exactly reversed, or, better still, could all liquors, save for hospital uses, have been proscribed in the army, we believe the war would have been ended longer before it was, and many a hearthstone, now desolate, would be gladdened by the presence of the unfortunate ones who, in various ways, fell innocent victims to this great curse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>To see the eager crowd gather round the recipient of a box and watch the unpacking and unwrapping of every article, and each commend as approvingly as if the contents were his own, would have rejoiced the hearts of the kind friends at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>It was downright enjoyment to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>If they belonged to the same tent's crew with the owner of the treasure they were sure of a closer interview than a simple observation gave them; for the war, with its community of interest, developed sympathy and large-hearted generosity among the rank and file, and <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> <figure id="fig.075"> 
<head><rs type="role" reg="Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel">Brevet Lieut. Colonel</rs></head></figure> <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> they shared liberally, especially with those who had no <num value="1">one</num> at home to remember them in this pleasant manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>With our departure from <placeName reg="Poolsville">Poolsville</placeName> more than <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> of our term of service had expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>If we had not made our mark in active service the fault was not our own. We obeyed orders, we did not originate them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>It was not unusual for troops to be inactive several months after their muster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It will be remembered, too, that there was little activity in the main army after our arrival at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 23" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> lay inactive nearly <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> subsequent to the disastrous <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>But there is no doubt whatever about our having been serviceable here, and that the presence of our brigade at the upper fords of the <rs>Potomac</rs> did prevent frequent incursions of Rebel raiders into this section.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>But there are other reasons for claiming that these were valuable months for the <rs>Company</rs> and the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, then, there is of necessity a broad chasm to be spanned between the citizen and the full-fledged soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>The citizen possesses certain rights in whose exercise he is restricted when he becomes a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>As a citizen he has a voice in deciding who shall be his rulers; as a soldier, usually none: as a citizen he is justly bound to obey all laws intended to promote the general welfare, since he had a voice in making them; as a soldier he is held rigidly accountable for the infringement of all military laws, in whose making he had no voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>It matters not if they are the mandates of the veriest tyrant in the army, or if they violate every principle of reason, common-sense, or justice; the laws of the service are inexorable, and its exigencies require an unflinching and exact obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The existence <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> of a conscience in the person of the offender is not for a moment to be considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>As a citizen his time is wholly his own; as a soldier there is not a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to which lie can surely lay claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>The citizen calls no man master; the soldier may be compelled to bow before a man infinitely his inferior in every respect,&mdash;illustrations of which were very frequent during the war. In view of these and other considerations that night be cited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>time was a very desirable and potent agency in bringing about the adaptation of the citizen to the new order of things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Again, the fact of our proficiency in <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> tactics has already been alluded to, and we only re. fer to it already as a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> advantage derived in these early months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Instances were not wanting, during the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, of batteries being sent to the front, under a pressing demand for troops, as soon as they received their guns, without this thorough preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>They had the implements of warfare, it is true, but were the merest apprentices with them, and consequently, when involved in an action, had no confidence in themselves and felt comparatively helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>There can be but <num value="1">one</num> result under such circumstances,&mdash;that of confusion and disaster to this particular organization, and, perhaps, through it to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Hence, whenever we reflect upon our record at <placeName reg="Camp Barry">Camp Barry</placeName> and at <placeName reg="Poolsville">Poolsville</placeName> in this respect, it arouses our pride, and we feel that these were valuable months in the school of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>If the <orgName type="regiment" key="10MABattery">Tenth Massachusetts Battery</orgName> was a unit during its nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of service,&mdash;and it certainly was; if the men were subordinate to their superiors, &mdash;and the residents of <placeName reg="Poolsville">Poolsville</placeName> say they left a good impression there in this respect; if the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> did its full duty whenever its services were called <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> for,&mdash;and the official reports do it ample justice on this head; if its members ever stood up manfully to their work, confident in their own strength, fearlessly dealing out death and destruction among the enemy, silencing battery after batter, under adversity defiantly contesting every inch of ground,&mdash;and we challenge any company in the service, engaged the same number of times, to show a better record; if the history of this organization in its entirety is <num value="1">one</num> of which its members, its friends, and the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> may justly be proud,&mdash;and this fact has received recognition on many public occasions;&mdash;the pages of that history were heightened in their glory and brilliancy by sharp general and individual discipline in the schools of <placeName reg="Camp Barry">Camp Barry</placeName> and <placeName reg="Poolsville">Poolsville</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Many of them have been built since the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>Our stay here was otherwise uneventful, and continued until the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, when, at evening, orders came to strap sacks of grain upon the caissons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>This, in our experience, plainly portended a move, although some had thought no further movement probable, owing to the lateness of the season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>But all surmises were now at an end on this head, and at <time value="3:30am">3.30 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>Batterymen, to be studied in their most favorable aspects, should never be seen at so early an hour nor under such inauspicious circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>In the darkness ensued a scene difficult to describe, but perfectly familiar to artillerymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>Soon huge bonfires were lighted, and in their glare men were seen with loads of varying description in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>Tents were struck, leaving merely the skeletons of our late abodes, and through the camp resounded a Babel-like hubbub.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>The rattling of harnesses mingled with divers (and drivers') expletives, which were hurled at unruly or laggard horses, whose movements on this occasion showed, in <num value="1">one</num> respect at least, their kinship to man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>The detailed men must be dispatched immediately, a respectful <q direct="unspecified">yes, sir,</q> returned to every order, a horse at once sought out to relieve the lame <num value="1">one</num>, the extra tent stowed away on some caisson, a corporal found and sent for the coffee and sugar, and the widely scattered detachment notified to fall in for rations, all in the same breath, or the sergeant will be reprimanded for delay in getting his piece ready.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>Amid all this apparent confusion everything goes on rapidly and orderly, and long before daylight every horse is harnessed, every tent packed, every wagon loaded, the marching rations distributed, breakfast eaten, and all are ready for a start.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>In this movement the army set out in <num value="2">two</num> divisions, the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> composed of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 5">Fifth</orgName> and <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">Sixth corps</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Sedgwick,General,,,," id="n0245.0009.00156.00990" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,John,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>, leading; followed by the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, including the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 1">First</orgName>, <orgName type="corps" n="corps 2">Second</orgName>, and <orgName type="corps" n="corps 3">Third corps</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="French,General,,,," id="n0245.0009.00156.00991" reg="mostcommon:French,John,W.,,:5"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>Just as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> streaks of dawn lighted the east, we filed out into the road and took position with that division, which, as might be expected, had the advance of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> having moved by another road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/><pb id="p.157" n="157"/> Having marched rapidly, but quite noiselessly, a distance of perhaps <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure>, we reached the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> at <placeName reg="Kelly's Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2112479">Kelly's Ford</placeName> about noon, and the troops were massed as they came up, behind a low ridge of hills, which concealed them from the enemy across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>No fires were permitted, drums and bugles were hushed, and the greatest quiet observed to insure a surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>But we were not obliged to wait long; orders soon came for us, and we were led by a winding road to a commanding position on the left, overlooking the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> and the village of <placeName reg="Kellysville, Mercer, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118802">Kellysville</placeName> beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>The latter lay somewhat to our right front, while directly across, the ground gradually rose in plain, unobstructed view, until at last a belt of woods, perhaps half a mile distant, shut off further prospect in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>This opening and these woods we were instructed to watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>While occupied in doing this a succession of rattling sounds, which some affirmed to be the fire of skirmishers, but which others, with equal positiveness, declared to emanate from the engineers engaged in unloading planks for a pontoon, fell upon the ear, coming from our right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>We could not verify either assertion, as the ford at which the crossing was to take place was hidden from our view by dense woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>While engaged in scanning the territory under our special guardianship, we see at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> only a few scattered men hastily driving back into the woods a number of cattle that had been grazing in the opening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>Soon after a squad of horsemen, perhaps <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen in number, emerge from cover and ride towards the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>Presuming them to to be Rebel officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>we send a salutation of <num value="6">six</num> howling shells at them, and although we may not have increased the <rs>Confederate</rs> mortality by our sextuple <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> deputation, we confidently assert that the same number of men were never any more completely demoralized and left alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>It was truly enjoyable to see them scatter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>Each man seemed all at once to have pressing business to transact elsewhere, and of such a nature that he preferred to go unaccompanied, for such was the suddenness of their departure that no <num value="2">two</num> fled the same way. A small force coming out as skirmishers we serve in like manner, and send them to cover, a part in the woods and others in rifle-pits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>They are followed in a few moments by a brigade in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>It advances firmly and confidently at a double-quick, with bayonets, held at charge, glistening in the sun, and evidently intent on sweeping our force of infantry, which had by this time effected a crossing, back into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>But this is a matter in which we propose to have something to say, and by the time they have traversed half the interval between the woods and the river, we are sending our <persName n="Schenkl,,,,," id="n0245.0009.00158.00994" reg="mostcommon:Schenkl,nomatch:0"><surname>Schenkl</surname></persName> shells among them in quick succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>The result is immediate and surpasses our highest anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>The line wavers for a moment, then breaks and scatters, some returning to the woods, but the larger portion keeps on and seeks refuge either in the rifle-pits or the buildings in <placeName key="tgn,2118802" n="1.000 2" reg="kellysville, mercer, west virginia">Kellysville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>On the latter we now train our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>The range being rather short, every shell takes effect, as we afterwards ascertain from personal observation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>Thus far we had had the fun all our own way, but now our attention is drawn away from the village, for while we have been interested in breaking up the line of battle and persecuting its fragments, a Rebel battery has emerged from the woods unperceived, has taken position, and announces its business intentions by sending a <num value="12">12</num>-pound shot over to us. <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> Hearing the report, and turning, we see the puff of smoke and catch sight of a black speck rising against the sky. It increases in size until finally it drops on the slope in our front and ricochets over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>In like manner we saw nearly every shot fired by the enemy before it reached us. They have a perfect range at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> shell whistles over us, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> crashes through a fallen tree in our rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>We accept their challenge without loss of time, and return their greetings with interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>So the fun goes on, but we have the advantage: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, in a superior position; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, in having rifled guns&mdash;theirs are smooth-bores,&mdash;and they are soon compelled to withdraw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Rebel battery to test our mettle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>It was by no means the last, however, to test it, with a similar result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>We have a <q direct="unspecified">record</q> in this respect of which we are rather proud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Never were our guns silenced or driven from position by Rebel artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>This adversary disposed of, we turn our battery once more on the village and those whom it harbors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>At sunset our attention is diverted by distant firing up the river, and casting our eyes in that direction we see, at a distance of some <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>, the smoke of the <rs n="Battle of Rappahannock Station" type="battle">battle of Rappahannock Station</rs>,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>The column would move on a few steps and halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>Thereupon cannoneers would seek some tolerably comfortable position on the carriages <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> or ground, and just begin to doze, when the column would move again, only to stop by the time <num value="1">one</num> was fairly awake; and this programme was repeated for hours after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>Our stops were of insufficient duration, either to cook a pot of coffee or steal a halfhour's nap, although intensely aggravated by the need of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>The weather, too, had grown quite cool and frosty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>The woods were aglow with the fires lighted by the troops that had preceded us, to keep them comfortable while awaiting their turn to cross; and in alternately shivering and dozing <figure id="fig.169">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>At this time the column came to a halt, which seemed likely to continue some time; at least we resolved to take our risks of its thus continuing; and the cannoneers at once bestirred themselves to light fires and procure water, which luckily flowed front a spring near at hand; while the drivers hastened to <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> feed their tired horses, putting on their nose-bags of grain as they stood harnessed in the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>Every man soon had his dipper of coffee smoking on the fire, and his rasher of pork or beef impaled on a stick and sputtering in the flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>These, with their inevitable hard-tack accompaniment, having been dispatched, we piled on wood and lay down to sleep on a bed of leaves and in the glow of the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>Being in momentary expectation of a forward summons, we hardly dared to unroll our blankets, containing, as they did, our little all of personal effects, that it would take us a few moments to gather up again; so we made vain efforts to keep warm without them by <q direct="unspecified">spooning</q> together; but as the fire died down, the pinching cold would rouse us from our light slumber, to put on more wood and lie down again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>So by alternate dozing and trimming the fires we succeeded in passing the remainder of what, we are confident, all the men considered a most wretched night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>Morning came at last, disclosing the ground covered by a white frost; and getting our horses started with some difficulty, cold, stiff, cross, and balky as they were, we moved on down to the river through an immense jam of cavalry, wagons, and batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>On the opposite bank were strong fortifications, in which a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men might have held a whole army at bay; but as our march was unexpected, our advance had met with no opposition here, the enemy being encamped at some distance from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>Having crossed over by pontoon, we found a very steep hill to be climbed ere we reached the top of the south bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>This explained the cause of the tedious delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>So steep was the rise that no team was sufficient to climb it unaided, and resort must be had to <q direct="unspecified">doubling up</q>; that is, each piece had the <q direct="unspecified">lead</q> <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> and <q direct="unspecified">swing</q> horses of its caisson added to its own strength to surmount the steep, and, having done this, <num value="4">four</num> of the piece horses returned with those of the caisson to help the latter up. All this consumed time, and a great deal of it, and it was high noon when the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> had been thus transferred to plane terra firma once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>But then our advance was promptly resumed along the <rs type="place">Stevensburg Plank Road</rs>, into the enemy's country, pursuing this course perhaps <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. Cannonading heard in the distance announced to us that the enemy had been found, and turning into the woods on our right, in the direction of the firing, we rapidly drew nearer the scene of battle, advancing at a trot as the sounds of strife became more distinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>We are to be hurried without delay into battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>What an array of sensations crowd themselves upon us as we rush along!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>The unknown result, the dread possibilities, nay, even probabilities, the quick thoughts of home and loved ones, the conscious shrinking from impending danger, and the antagonizing something within, which yet impels us sternly onward,&mdash;all these raise a tumult in the mind which every soldier will remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>What is it that thus spurs us on, our breasts bared to the enemy, while all the flesh cries out against it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>Is it courage?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>Is it the fear of being branded as cowards?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>Is it mad indifference to consequences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Are we buoyed up to the requirements of the situation by the touch of the elbow to the right and left, of those who are hurrying on with us alike ignorant of consequences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>Ah, it is something higher and more powerful than all these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>It is not courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>No man of sane mind ever faced a hostile line of battle without flinching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>There is no manliness in such an act. It is not fear of the stigma of cowardice, for the circumstances of the <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> hour are such that the stigma can be easily evaded, if any <num value="1">one</num> cares to deserve it. It is not blind indifference or rashness, for an occasion of this nature begets thoughtfulness and a thoughtfulness born of discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>Moreover, the thoughtful man is not rash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>Rashness in a well-balanced mind is more likely to involve another in difficulty than the author of it. It is not companionship in the hour of danger, though that undoubtedly steadies the nerves in a measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>The impelling power includes all these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>It is duty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>That it is which says to us, <q direct="unspecified">You voluntarily put your hand to the plough, thus imposing upon yourself the responsibility of all the consequences entailed by that act. <num value="1">One</num> of those consequences, the risk of your life or limb, is now impending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Are you ready to stand by your contract?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>And the soldier who had not self-respect enough to honor such a draft as that deserved to have his name branded with eternal disgrace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>But we will make no longer pause to analyze our feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>Suffice it, if, from any or all considerations, we can hold ourselves resolutely to the promised work of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>We were spared the ordeal of battle this time, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>After travelling in woods some distance, we emerged on the <rs type="place">Orange Turnpike</rs>, <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> <offset>east</offset> of  <placeName reg="Robertson's Tavern">Robertson's Tavern</placeName></placeName>, in whose vicinity a part of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2"><persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0245.0010.00172.01049" reg="mostcommon:Warren,Gouverneur,K.,,:2"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>'s Second Corps</orgName> had been engaged, and parked near their hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>In these lay many men dead or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>Among the former was <persName n="Hesser,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0245.0010.00172.01050" reg="mostcommon:Hesser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>While we lay here, <persName n="Randolph,Captain,,,," id="n0245.0010.00172.01051" reg="mostcommon:Randolph,George,E.,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName> dispatched an aid to <persName n="French,General,,,," id="n0245.0010.00172.01052" reg="mostcommon:French,John,W.,,:5"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName> to inquire whether he would like more artillery, to which answer was sent that he already had more than he could get into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>It seems he took the wrong road from the ford, and had <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> fallen in with a part of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n0245.0010.00173.01053" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,Henry,L.,,:6"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> before he had spanned half the distance from the river to the tavern, where he was to have joined <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0245.0010.00173.01054" reg="nearbymention:Warren,Gouverneur,K.,,"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>On the morning of Saturday the <num value="28" type="ordinal">28th</num>, towards <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, our march was resumed to <placeName reg="Robertson's Tavern">Robertson's Tavern</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>In this somewhat dilapidated hostelry <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0245.0010.00173.01057" reg="mostcommon:Meade,Geo,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName> had established his headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>Just to the westward of it a breastwork had been thrown up by our forces, which ran across the turnpike at right angles, and a countervailing defence of similar character was erected by the <rs>Rebels</rs> still farther on. As the latter had fallen back, neither of these was now occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>Drops of rain had commenced to fall as we left our camp in the morning, and had now multiplied to such an extent that locomotion was becoming decidedly uncomfortable and difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time> we were again ordered forward, marching down the pike through the earthworks already mentioned, behind which an occasional dead Rebel was seen, lying as he fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>The haversack of <num value="1">one</num> of these which we investigated, contained nothing except a quart of raw, uncracked corn, and the body was clothed with an amount of covering inadequate to the season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>How can <num value="1">one</num> do otherwise than admire a devotion to a cause, so intense as to endure these <num value="2">two</num> hardships of scanty fare and exposure!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>We must pay this tribute to Rebel patriotism even while we disapprove of and condemn the convictions which prompted it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>Leaving the pike we turn to our left into the <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> woods, which form a part of the region appropriately termed the <rs>Wilderness</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>Here we halt for a short time, awaiting a supply of rations from the train, which was parked across the river at <placeName reg="Richardsville, Putnam, New York" key="tgn,2617206">Richardsville</placeName>, under the protection of our cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>Having obtained these we plunge on again through the mire, and at last emerge from the woods upon a ridge which falls away gently before us to a small stream known as <placeName key="tgn,2516268;tgn,2516267;tgn,2516266;tgn,2516265;tgn,2516264" n="0.091 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2516268;mine run, orange, virginia,Orange,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2516267;Mine Run, Culpeper, Virginia,Culpeper,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2516266;Mine Run, Shenandoah, Virginia,Shenandoah,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2516265;Mine Run, Page, Virginia,Page,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2516264;Mine Run, Spotsylvania, Virginia,Spotsylvania,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="mine run, orange, virginia,Orange,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Mine Run, Culpeper, Virginia,Culpeper,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Mine Run, Shenandoah, Virginia,Shenandoah,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Mine Run, Page, Virginia,Page,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Mine Run, Spotsylvania, Virginia,Spotsylvania,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">Mine Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>The rain had ceased falling before mid-afternoon, and a cold wind, starting up from the westward, had cleared the face of the heavens, so that the stars now shone brightly above us. When night fairly obscured our movements from the enemy we put our guns into position, having as a supporting force the <orgName type="regiment" key="63PAVolunteer">Sixty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>We are now at the very front Just before us is our outer line of pickets, and along the horizon gleam the lights from the camp-fires of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> we lay down to get what rest we could, fully expecting to take part in a great battle the following morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>All night long the busy click of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of axes, heard faintly across the valley, told us the enemy were vigorously at work on their fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>When daylight broke, red lines of fresh earth stretching along the opposite ridge showed to how good purpose they had labored.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>It was a clear, quiet Sabbath morning, but no Sabbath bells broke the stillness, summoning us away from the unhallowed pursuit of war to the worship of Him, the maker of foe as well as friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>Our attention was early devoted to getting the guns into a better position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Everything still remained quiet, but our skirmishers were now advancing, and the opening of a general engagement was momentarily expected; they succeeded, however, in provoking only skirmishing in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>Thus the forenoon wore <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> away, and a cold wind springing up, we gathered around huge fires to discuss and ponder the scenes which might be close at land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Rumor, with her <num value="100">hundred</num> tongues, was a potent agent in keeping the discussion animated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>Every orderly who gallops by, every straggler who comes up from the rear, has his contribution of wisdom to add to the general fund; for it is in the safe rear, among the <q direct="unspecified">Coffee Coolers</q> and <q direct="unspecified"><orgName type="company" n="Company Q">Company Q</orgName>,</q> that the most marvellous accounts of battles and authentic reports of movements are concocted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>The attention of the army was now occupied in settling itself comfortably in winter-quarters about <placeName reg="Brandy Station, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2110767">Brandy Station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>For miles in all directions sprang up the tented villages and cities, as regiments, brigades, or divisions pitched their white canvas or built their more substantial log cabins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>There were the aristocratic establishments for <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army, corps</orgName>, or division headquarters, with spacious surroundings, enclosed in many cases by a hedge of pine, and having tastefully arched entrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>Apart from these were the camps of the troops laid out in regular streets, <num value="1">one</num> to a company, a row of tents flanking either side, and not far away hospital and commissary tents were erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Sutlers opened their stores, exchanging homeopathic doses of goods for allopathic quantities of greenbacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>Tents of the <orgName n="Christian Commission" type="commission">Christian Commission</orgName>, too, were to be found near large centres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>The wagon trains were drawn up in long lines, and near them shelters for the protection of the mules were erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>But the most unique camp in the whole army was that built and occupied by the <orgName type="mil" key="EngCorps">Engineer Corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>These were the pioneers of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Their duties consisted in constructing <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> roads where needed, corduroying impassable places over which the army must move, laying pontoon bridges, taking up the same, and all work of kindred nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>They were not called upon to fight except in self-defence, and became very expert in the duties of their department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>They gave their mechanical and inventive skill full play in the construction of their officers' quarters, which were marvels of their kind, ofttimes of <num value="2">two</num> stories, with many angles and much ornament, fashioned out of the straight cedar, which being undressed, gave the settlement a rustic appearance truly unique and pleasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>Even the quarters of the rank and file were remarkably ornate, and as cosy and convenient within as they were attractive without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>Their streets were corduroyed, and they even boasted sidewalks similarly constructed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>In erecting our own quarters for the winter, we made no lofty endeavors of the above nature, but satisfied ourselves with the simplest construction consistent with keeping comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>In a former chapter the fact was mentioned of our being furnished with shelter-tents, but no description of these was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>They were pieces of drilling about <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> square, so light that an ordinary rain would easily drive through them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>Life in winter camp was pretty much the same throughout the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>Tales of battle told by comrades from other regiments, who called to renew old acquaintances, beguiled a part of the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>Some of the men engaged in an extensive correspondence, or read every book that came before them, whether trashy or sensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>Many played at cards, and in these and other ways showed a spirit of contentment unknown to them a year before, when they had experienced little of the wear and tear of the service, and were less disciplined in making the best of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>A few pored over new or neglected studies, and the old yet ever fresh questions of Matter and Spirit, Good and Evil, and Ultimate Atoms, were favorite themes with some of a more philosophic turn of mind.</p>

<p>But our approach had not been unknown to the enemy, for we speedily became an object of interest to Rebel sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>At the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> discharge a mass of fire, smoke and fragments was seen to shoot heavenward behind the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>We had exploded a limber chest for them, and a ringing cheer went up from our lungs, to tell them how badly we felt about it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>Not long after this, there came from down the river the roar of musketry and cheering of soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>But <num value="30">thirty</num> of them were captured in the redan, and the road was thus cleared to the bridge, with a loss on our side of less than <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>While this charge was in progress we shelled at random over the woods into the enemy's lines beyond the river, trusting to chance for our missiles to afford any aid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>During the night, the <rs>Rebels</rs> made futile efforts to burn the bridge, but the dawn showed that they had fallen back from the river at this part of the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>In the evening we were relieved by <orgName n="batteries"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n0245.0013.00247.01862" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,Mine,,,:1"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s batteries</orgName>, and drawing out went into park.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>We were aroused at <time value="1:30">half-past 1</time> the following morning to be in readiness, as we supposed, for an early attack, but made no movement until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>We then took position at the extreme left of our line, or nearly so, on commanding ground, and there threw up earth-works again; but we had no occasion to use them, for we lay inactive most of the day. Our corps was crossing the river upon the bridge, and the only hostile demonstration attracting our attention, meanwhile, was a Rebel battery some distance up the river, which fired at short intervals during the whole day, although in doing so it invariably drew upon itself a concentrated fire from several of our batteries which had it in tolerably fair range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>Its persistence against such odds became explicable when, about sundown, it came our turn to cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>To us on that wooden bridge suspended <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> above the river, compelled to walk at a slow pace, and even then swaying the frail structure considerably, the air seemed thick with Rebel shell and ball, and we seemed an age in crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>That battery, from a well-chosen position, and protected by <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> elaborate works, was closely watching the bridge, and whenever a body of troops attempted to cross, it opened briskly upon them, evidently hoping and striving to strike the bridge thus encumbered, in a vital spot, and thereby perform a double service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>It may have been in their minds, should any catastrophe betide the bridge, to fall upon that portion of the corps already across.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>But this structure was destined to serve the <rs>Union</rs> cause to the full; and although those Rebel guns were posted not above <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> up river from it, and were served at short intervals during the entire day, they never once struck it, and the only casualties were the wounding of <num value="2">two</num> men. We can do no less, however, than pay a tribute of admiration to the cannoneers of those guns, who stood so steadfastly by them despite the hot fire poured in upon them by <num value="3">three</num> of our batteries, though we must condemn them for poor shooting, as, at their distance, the bridge should have been destroyed with <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> the amount of ammunition they expended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>Having got safely across, affairs wore a stormy aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>We lay perhaps half a mile from the river near a brick house, awaiting orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>A part of the corps was engaging the enemy, with what result we could not then determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>We were in just the position to receive the enemy's shells, which every now and then dropped or exploded uncomfortably near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>Soon a line of infantry was rapidly deployed near us, and some of them began to fortify, in momentary expectation of an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>Just at this time, the clouds having been gathering blackness, discharged their contents, and the combatants were drenched in a torrent of rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>This seemed to cool their ardor, and the fighting ceased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>We lay here all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>The next day we were <pb id="p.249" n="249"/> sent down to the left to relieve <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Ricketts,,,,," id="n0245.0013.00249.01863" reg="mostcommon:Ricketts,James,B.,,:1"><surname>Ricketts</surname></persName>' Battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>Meanwhile we could not fail to notice that matters did not seem to be working satisfactorily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>Anxiety was perceptible on the faces of all general officers, and was further betrayed by the frequent marchings and counter-marchings from point to point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>The cause of all this uneasiness seems to have been due to the position occupied by the army with respect to the enemy, which was substantially as follows:&mdash;<orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5"><persName n="Warren,General,,,," id="n0245.0013.00249.01864" reg="mostcommon:Warren,Gouverneur,K.,,:2"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Warren</surname></persName>'s Fifth Corps</orgName> had crossed the river at <placeName reg="Jericho Ford">Jericho Ford</placeName>, <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> above us, without opposition, and, having advanced some distance, repelled an assault from <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n0245.0013.00249.01865" reg="mostcommon:Hill,Pierce,T.,,:8"><surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> and established his lines, correspondingly forcing back <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0245.0013.00249.01866" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>By reason of the advance of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName> across the river, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0245.0013.00249.01867" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> drew back his right to cover <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName>, still clinging with his centre to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>His army was thus in the form of a V, the apex resting on the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>Thus situated, he could promptly reinforce any portion of his line that was threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>Nothing, we now believe, but <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0245.0013.00249.01872" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz-Hugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s inferior force could have prevented him from executing this maneuver.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>Our line of march now took us in a course nearly eastward, for the turning of the enemy's flank anew necessitated quite an extended detour for several reasons: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that our destination should not be unmasked too soon; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that the enemy should not assail our flank on the march; and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, because of the nature of the country.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>We at once began to strengthen the line, doing it at a disadvantage under the fire of sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>This being done, we opened on the enemy's works <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> at short range; but as there was a line of troops in our front that was endangered by the pieces of lead flying from our shells, an evil peculiar to rifled projectiles,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/> 
<p>During the war it was frequently charged against artillerists that they fired into their own troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>Now, to deny that some such cases did occur&mdash;due, we do not hesitate to say, either to excited or ignorant gunnery&mdash;would be as idle as to deny that our infantry never fired but at the enemy, or never killed men of their own side without design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>But the cases coming under the above head probably do not number more than <num value="0.1">ten per centum</num> of all that are charged, and the author has thought it desirable to explain to that limited public outside of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">Tenth</num>, whose eyes may fall upon these lines, the cause of the remaining charges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>In the first place, then, the <hi rend="italics">time fuse</hi>, used to explode shells and cut to burn a given number of seconds, was frequently so unreliable that it would burst the shell short of the mark&mdash;perhaps among our infantry, if by chance they lay between the guns and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>We have seen them burst within <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> of the gun. This would account for many of the remaining charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>But again: Those familiar with the <name>Hotchkiss</name> ammunition, then in use, know that around each shell was a flange of lead which not infrequently flew in fragments a short distance from the gun, and that about the base of the <name>Schenkl</name> shell was a firm mass of <hi rend="italics">papier-mache</hi>, which likewise took an early divorce from the projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>It requires no ordinary nerve, either in kind or quantity, for men to lie exposed to the fire of the enemy in their front; what more natural, then, than for them, ignorant of the facts given, to conclude, when some of the fragments above mentioned fell among them, that they were receiving the fire of their own side?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Indeed, it would practically amount to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>Such a position is unquestionably an ugly <num value="1">one</num> to occupy, and shelling over troops was practised only exceptionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>To strengthen our position in this matter, if it needs it, we cite an illustration from the battle of the <rs>Po. We</rs> have already alluded in these pages to a battery which raked us with great accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>That battery was at least a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> distant, and our guns were elevated accordingly; but we were ordered to cease firing because of the flying metal endangering some of our troops who lay <hi rend="italics">in a hollow not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> that distance away</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>The above statements are made with reference to projectiles for rifled guns only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>Just how much difficulty arose from the fixed ammunition of the smooth-bores we have neither the experience nor information from which to judge.</p></note> under cover of darkness we moved forward once more, and established ourselves on a side hill in the very front line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>Our situation here was somewhat peculiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>The left piece was at the foot of the hill, while the right was some distance higher up; and all the guns were below the level of the <rs>Rebel</rs> works, which at this point ran along a cut of the <rs>Petersburg</rs> and <rs>Norfolk</rs> <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> Railroad,&mdash;so it was said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>They were scarcely <measure n="250yards" type="distance">two hundred and fifty yards distant</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>Having sunk the limbers, sent the horses to the rear, and strengthened the line by building it higher than our heads, leaving embrasures, occupied when not in use by screens similar to those constructed at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, we spent what was left of the night in. resting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>When daylight of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> dawned, firing began, and the quick, sharp whiz of the <rs>Rebel</rs> bullets would have informed us of our unusual nearness to the enemy's lines had sight failed to convey such information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>Now and then we would take down the screens from the embrasures and treat their marksmen, who fired at us through loop-holes left along the top of their line, to a few percussion shells, but <hi rend="italics">only</hi> a few, for a brief time sufficed them to send a small hailstorm of bullets at each porthole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>A Rebel battery, nearly opposite, was kept perfectly mute by the <rs>Union</rs> sharpshooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>The day was intensely warm; and shut in as we were by woods and rising ground, we were glad, when not engaged, to seek the shade of our half-shelters pitched against the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>But the day did not pass without its amusing scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>All going to the rear, for any purpose whatsoever, must be done under fire, so completely were we commanded by the <rs>Rebels</rs> and Rebel lines; and to see the lively dodging and scampering of any courier or visitor to our part of the line when he unwittingly came within sight and range of the enemy, was provocative of hearty laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>But it took on a serious aspect when a soldier, coming, as <num value="1">one</num> did, to call upon friends in a regiment stationed next us, was shot dead in their very sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>Yet even this scene could cast but a temporary gloom over the witnesses, so hardened does human nature become by repeated experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>It is a well-known fact, that, inasmuch as the artillery of the army was abundant, and the opportunities to use it all had been limited, there were several batteries which had scarcely been called into action during the campaign, unless for siege duty at <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, having been kept with the <orgName n="Reserve Artillery" type="artillery">reserve artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>As the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA10">Tenth Massachusetts</orgName> had not been of that number, it was not unlikely, so we reasoned, that we were now to <q direct="unspecified">lie off</q> awhile, rest the horses and men, and give some <num value="1">one</num> else a chance; and it was in this expectation that, having joined the <orgName type="mil" key="ArtilleryBrigade">Artillery Brigade</orgName> on the following afternoon (<dateStruct value="-06-21"><day type="name">Monday</day>, <month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="21">21</day></dateStruct>), we went somewhat to the rear and parked, in spacious order, in a large field skirted with woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>But we were doomed to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>There was other business on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>The next day was <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> of the month, and shortly after dawn sounds of skirmishing were heard, continuing until about the middle of the afternoon, when the firing increased to rapid volleys, indicating hot work ahead&mdash;for it was up the road towards <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>Orders soon came to harness and be ready to move without delay, which, under the circumstances, we obeyed with at least our accustomed alacrity, for the firing drew nearer and the road was bustling with couriers dashing to the rear, and other appearances indicating that all was not right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>Soon came the explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>The history of this disaster to the corps is in brief as follows: The line taken by our army before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> had been so strengthened that a small portion <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> of the entire force was sufficient to hold it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3438"/>Those cannoneers whose duty it was to carry ammunition, not wishing to run backwards and forwards any more than necessary under so warm a fire, now brought what few rounds remained in the limbers to the shelter of the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3439"/>By sitting in the shallow trench under the muzzle of the guns, when not engaged, the breastwork gave us protection from Rebel shot, but when loading and firing we were necessarily exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3441"/>But the afternoon wears on, and everything betokens a tempest yet to burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3442"/>The hours are anxious <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> ones to us, and they are made the more so by noting the character of our support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>It is the <orgName type="regiment" key="4NYHvArtillery">Fourth New York Heavy Artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3444"/>The men scarcely show signs of life, much less of an active interest, as they lie crouched low in the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3445"/>Once in a while <num value="1">one</num> does venture a shot, but he elevates his musket over the works, pointing it skyward, as if he saw the enemy approaching from that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>Said an ex-Confederate, who participated in the fight, <q direct="unspecified">Your support didn't kill any of our men. We never saw such queer shooting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>They all pointed their guns up into the air and shot far above us.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/>We remember suggesting that the <rs>Rebels</rs> were not winged creatures, but it was wholly lost upon them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3449"/>No word reaches us from the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> as to just what is expected of us. No orderlies appear with despatches, nor are staff officers to be seen anywhere taking observations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3450"/>But this is not to be wondered at. To approach our line from the rear is simply a reckless hazard of life, which few dare assume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3451"/>Thus we remain totally ignorant of what is occurring on other parts of the line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>By and by our ammunition draws low. The caissons cannot come up with more, for every horse not already disabled would be sacrificed in attempting it. The only way to get a supply is for cannoneers to creep along inside the works, and reaching a point less exposed, run the gauntlet to the rear and provide themselves with a few rounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/><num value="1">One</num> man from each piece makes the trip, and returns in safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>The stillness grows more and more oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>We chafe like caged lions, for we feel that the worst is yet to come, and wish, as did <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0245.0017.00317.02324" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>, that <q direct="unspecified">either <persName n="Blucher,,,,," id="n0245.0017.00317.02325" reg="mostcommon:Blucher,nomatch:0"><surname>Blucher</surname></persName> or night would <pb id="p.318" n="318"/> come</q> to relieve us from impending calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>This calmness, we know, forebodes an attack respecting whose result we are, not unreasonably, fearful, for the line is thin and our support unreliable, and if a determined assault is made the chances are strongly against us. There is no retreat for the artillery&mdash;certainly not for <orgName type="regiment" key="MA10"><persName n="Sleeper,,,,," id="n0245.0017.00318.02326" reg="mostcommon:Sleeper,Jacob,Henry,,:32"><surname>Sleeper</surname></persName>'s Tenth Massachusetts</orgName>&mdash;and we have but a few rounds of ammunition left, not an encouraging outlook, truly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>So we watch and wait as the sun slowly sinks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>At this stage we are anticipating a new danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3459"/>It is that the enemy are preparing to open with artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3460"/>If they do, we must lie behind our frail protection, and take without giving in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3461"/>While we thus lie inactive, momentarily expecting the next move of the enemy, not far from <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, <num value="1">one</num> of our support, an honorable exception, who has kept a sharp lookout, suddenly exclaims, <q direct="unspecified">Look up there on the right!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3462"/>There, sure enough, emerging from the woods beyond the <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111478">Dinwiddie</placeName> road into the opening that stretched before the intrenchments, between us and the <orgName type="regiment" key="12NYBattery">Twelfth New York Battery</orgName>, are charging lines of Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3463"/>They come at the double-quick, with flashing bayonets, and ringing out their familiar yell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3464"/>On the instant we turn our muzzles to the right and give them canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/> 
<p>The <orgName type="mil" key="RIBattery">Rhode Island Battery</orgName> was out of range.</p></note> Some of our support (?) run to the rear, many lie inert in the ditch, and a few join in repelling the enemy's assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/>But even then it is a. warm reception, and ere the hostile lines have fairly reached the works they break, reel, and surge to the rear in confusion, seeking the woods again, and leaving the ground thickly sprinkled with their slain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3468"/>We set up a shout at their discomfiture, but feel that the worst is not yet over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3469"/>This proves to <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> be the case, for within <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, having been rallied under cover of the pines into which they fled, they are again descried in stronger force than before, .and pressing on solidly, regardless of the fire reopened upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3470"/>At this critical juncture, our heavy artillerymen, unable to honor the draft the situation made on their courage and manhood, started for the rear in large numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3471"/>In our exasperation we call them cowards, with all the choice adjectives prefixed that we can summon from our vocabulary on demand, and this plan not succeeding to our satisfaction, we threaten to turn our guns upon them unless they remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3472"/>This stayed the tide, and many who had gone but a few rods came back<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3473"/> 
<p>I now question the wisdom of our procedure, for these men had done and would do no fighting, and by keeping them on the field we but swelled the proportions of the <rs>Rebel</rs> triumph, for they were all taken prisoners.</p></note> But the enfilading fire of the same <num value="2">two</num> batteries, coupled with the brave stand made by a part of the infantry in their front, again turns the scale, and the enemy flee to cover anew, shattered and baffled, leaving an increased number of their dead behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3474"/>Had every man in the <rs>Union</rs> line done his duty as unflinchingly as the <rs>Rebels</rs> did theirs (and why should they not have stood even more firmly?) not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the charging party would have left the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3475"/>We now take courage, hoping that they have retired from the contest beaten, and satisfied to give up their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3476"/>Not so. In the next few minutes they bring up and plant <num value="8">eight</num> pieces of artillery directly in our front beyond the corn, and open a furious cannonade upon us. The air seems filled with the shrieking shells, with the flash, smoke, and crash of their explosion, and the harsh hurtling of their fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3477"/>It is unquestionably the heaviest <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> artillery fire we have ever endured at close range, but alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/> 
<p>For the information of the uninformed it may be stated that every fort in the <rs>Union</rs> line was named, and every part of the line constructed for the use of a battery was numbered, beginning at the right of the line near the <rs>James</rs> and numbering toward the left.</p></note> a few rods to the right of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Fort Morton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>The works we had left <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> before, so hastily and rudely constructed, had given place to a fortified line so elaborate and strong that it scarcely needed defenders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>The special portion we occupied was <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> high, and constructed of logs smoothly jointed, with several feet of earth piled against them outwardly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>The embrasures were shaped with <hi rend="italics">gabinos;</hi>these were cylinders of basket-work the size of a barrel, woven of green withes, filled with sand and set up on either side of the openings to give them sharpness and regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>Before each embrasure a matting of rope <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> thick was hung to keep out bullets, with an aperture left in it just large enough to pass the muzzle of the piece through when a charge was to be fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>Directly in front of the line was a deep ditch, and a rod or more outside of that ran the <hi rend="italics">fraise</hi>,a defence consisting of large, pointed stakes set firmly in the ground about <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> or more apart, their points projecting outward at an angle of perhaps <num value="30">thirty</num> degrees with the ground, and all fastened firmly together by telegraph wire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>To troops advancing against them the points would come about breast high, and as <num value="1">one</num> might not crawl through them below, and could scale them only with great difficulty, they were an efficient defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>Outside the fraise, deep trenches and covered ways led to the picket line, itself a strong fortification, where the pickets kept watch of the <rs>Rebels</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>Returning within our own lines, the view was most unique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>To the rear the ground fell off rapidly to the bottom of a gully, and rising on the opposite side even more rapidly, stretched away in a level tract of land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>But our immediate surroundings were such as to warrant <num value="1">one</num> in the belief that an army of huge moles had been building a city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>All passing to and from the rear was by deep trenches, in which the passers were shielded from bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>Some of these led to the dwelling-places of the troops, which toward the enemy showed simply as hemispherical domes of earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>These structures and others similar in form, built to hold the ammunition, were the bomb-proofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>Passing farther to the rear beyond the region of bomb-proofs, every sutler's establishment, every stable, every tent of any kind or size, was protected on the side towards the enemy either by a pile of earth, or by barrels filled with sand; for, during the days of continuous <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> picket-firing, all this territory lay open to the chance bullets of the enemy, and many a life was lost in this manner by persons unsuspicious of danger, as the graves scattered about the plain at brief intervals bore testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>In fact, this rear ground was generally considered the most unsafe part of the whole line until the abatement of picket-firing, and even then after dark, when such firing was most active, few cared to come out of their shelter to pass to or from the front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>About a mile to the rear, and beyond this dangerous belt of territory, out of reach of bullets, and generally of shells, headquarters of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> was established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>There were the drivers, spare men, horses, caissons, and company property generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/>With the guns were <persName n="Granger,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0245.0018.00343.02520" reg="mostcommon:Granger,Henry,H.,,:16"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Granger</surname></persName> in charge, and <num value="8">eight</num> men of each gun detachment.<note anchored="yes">

The guns were separated by very solid traverses, thus giving each detachment, as it were, a distinct apartment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>We made it our business by day to watch the red or yellow heaps of earth which marked the enemy's lines, and whenever any of their guns opened, or any number of men showed themselves at work on their fortifications, we sent them our customary Union compliments as an admonition that we were cognizant of all their acts, and should hold them accountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>But in artillery they were no match for us, either in the number of guns or their calibre, and whenever their pieces, in position directly opposite <orgName type="battery" n="Battery 14">Battery XIV</orgName>, opened on our line, they drew upon themselves not only our attentions, but those of the <pb id="p.344" n="344"/> guns in <orgName type="battery" n="Battery 13">Battery XIII</orgName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 3" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Haskell</placeName> on our right, and of <num value="2">two</num> <num value="32">32</num>-pounders in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Fort Morton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>These latter sent their ponderous projectiles with a rattling crash, beside which our <num value="10">10</num>-pounders seemed as muskets,&mdash;and with a precision that almost invariably closed up the business on the part of the enemy with little delay, although they were ever ready to open again when a good mark was presented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>We remember with what constancy <persName n="Granger,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0245.0018.00344.02522" reg="mostcommon:Granger,Henry,H.,,:16"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Granger</surname></persName> remained by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> piece hour after hour, and day after day, availing himself of every opportunity to send a shell into some unwary group of Rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>He always sighted the gun himself, and ere we left this place became most expert in gunnery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>It came to be the standard remark among the cannoneers whenever this gun was heard, that the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> was at his old tricks of shooting off Rebel buttons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/>He always took careful note of the result of each shot, with his field-glasses, by stepping to the right of the piece and looking over the top of the works, which at this particular point were partially screened by a few scattering trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>But he had proved such a nuisance to the enemy by his close watch and his unexpected introduction of shells among them, that <num value="1">one</num> day a Rebel sharpshooter, who had undoubtedly been awaiting his appearance, put a bullet through the top of his army regulation hat,&mdash;a circumstance which elated the <rs>Lieutenant</rs> immensely, so unmindful was he of his own personal safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>On the picket line there was now comparatively little firing by day, but when darkness came on it began, and, safely ensconced behind the works, we were often lulled to sleep by the music of bullets flying harmlessly overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, just before sundown, at a time when our line was very thin, an infantry officer came along to say that the <rs>Rebels</rs> were intending a tremendous assault on this part of the line, which, if they had by any means become aware of the paucity of its defenders, did not seem in the least improbable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>When night had well closed in, the assertion seemed about to be verified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>The pickets increased their fire; the main line, both infantry and artillery, joined in; and the familiar Rebel yell swelled louder and louder with the increasing din. There was uproar sufficient for a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class battle; but soon the yelling, the musketry, and the artillery subsided, and then the <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar batteries</orgName>, with which each fort was supplied, took up the contest, and the sky became brilliant with the fiery arches of these more dignified projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>The attack, if there was <num value="1">one</num>, had failed, and as the mortar shells described their majestic curves through the heavens, every other sound was hushed, and the <num value="2">two</num> armies <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> seemed to stand in mute admiration of these instruments of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>Sometimes a single shell could be seen climbing the sky from a Rebel mortar, and ere it had reached its destination, as many as half a dozen from <orgName n="Union Battery" type="battery">Union batteries</orgName> were chasing each other through the air as if anxious to be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in resenting such temerity; for in this arm of the service, as in the artillery, our army was vastly the superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>It should be stated, however, that the enemy could not afford to be as prodigal of their ammunition as the <name>Unionists</name>, had the guns not been wanting, for the beginning of the end was at hand, and they were finding themselves somewhat crippled in this respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>These evening fusillades rarely resulted in injuring any <num value="1">one</num> on our side, and were a <q direct="unspecified">feature</q> of our experience here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>So harmless were they considered, and at the same time so brilliant to view, that officials frequently came on from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 23" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> to witness then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>No less a person than <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0245.0018.00346.02528" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself was present at <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>They were expensive displays to the government, and served no practical purpose, so far as known, except to assure the enemy from time to time that our works were still occupied in force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>We have said these fusillades rarely did any damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>They nevertheless often succeeded in enlisting our warm personal interest, for the <orgName type="regiment" key="10Battery">Tenth Battery</orgName> was several times the mark of their particular attentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>At such times we would watch the shells closely as they mounted the sky. If they veered to the right or left from a vertical in their ascent, we cared nothing for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>If they rose perpendicularly, our interest increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>If they soon began to descend, we then knew they would fall short; but if they continued climbing until <pb id="p.347" n="347"/> much nearer the zenith, and we could hear the creaking whistle of the fuse as the shell slowly revolved through the air, business of a pressing nature suddenly called us into the bomb-proofs, and it was not transacted until an explosion was heard, or a jar told us the shell had expended itself in the earth.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4606"/>The corps commander seemed in no hurry to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/><pb id="p.422" n="422"/> Everything was as serene as in an established camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>We leisurely watered and fed our horses, and then prepared our own breakfasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/>Bands were playing merrily in all directions, men lay around at their ease, and the corps appeared more like a pleasure party than a host equipped for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>What did it mean?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4611"/>Towards <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the corps began to move leisurely forward, literally <q direct="unspecified">dragging its slow length along.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time firing was heard in the distance, as if to disprove the rumors, now oft repeated and persistent, of coming surrender.

This was a straw in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>It may seem to the casual reader that we were skeptical in the face of conclusive evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4616"/>But <q direct="unspecified">On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,</q> the earliest rallying cry, perhaps, of the war, had long since been enrolled among the jests of the period, and no <num value="1">one</num> thought of using it. now except as such, or in irony; for when the number of campaigns having that end in view, and entered upon by the army with enthusiasm, is recounted, all of which, to date, had ended in failure or worse disaster, it cannot seem strange that we had lost faith in the speedy coming of the long looked &mdash; for and much desired end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>Suddenly a bugle call was heard from the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/><pb id="p.423" n="423"/> We turned to discover its meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>It was a warning to clear the road for a carriage drawn by <num value="4">four</num> fine horses that were approaching at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>Within sat <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0245.0021.00423.03416" reg="mostcommon:Meade,Geo,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>, yet pale with an illness that had confined him to his ambulance for some days, but now his face wore a smile, and he was looking eagerly forward, as if with joyful anticipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>Not long after this all hands were ordered to the front, which surely indicated that in that direction there had ceased to be the usual danger, and the story soon reached us that all hostilities had ceased, and that our advance guard were walking side by side with the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> of the <name>Johnnies</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>Our faith was beginning to wax. Truly something was up, and it was beginning to dawn upon us, doubting souls!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>Now officers and orderlies began to come from the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>It had stacked arms pending the terms of surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>How the men chaffed each other between their hopes and fears, passing the long, anxious moments until all should be solved beyond doubt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>At last the suspense was brought to an end. A wave of motion <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> made by swaying bodies and uplifted hands swinging or throwing caps and hats aloft, rolled along the dense masses drawn up by the roadside nearer and nearer until we were swept in with the rest, willy, nilly, as by a tempest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>It is an ovation to <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0245.0021.00424.03419" reg="mostcommon:Meade,Geo,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>, who now appears in sight returning on horseback, galloping along the lines, cap in hand, his gray hair streaming in the wind, and his beaming countenance telling the whole story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>It was entirely superfluous for the major riding just behind to announce that <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0245.0021.00424.03420" reg="nearbymention:Lee,James,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> has surrendered,</q> for the army understood its General, and straightway went beside itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>Such a throwing up of caps, such hugging and hand-shaking, such cheering, shouting and singing, such laughing, alternating with crying!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>In short, a general effervescing in all the boyish demonstrations of which old soldiers are peculiarly capable, and which could in any way give expression to the irrepressible emotions of the hour, was indulged in till nature cried out in protest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>It was a rare occasion, the great day of a life-time, and <num value="1">one</num> whose impressions will end only with life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>We saw nothing of the <rs>Rebel</rs> army during the truce pending the surrender, as a halt had been ordered less than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> to their rear, but several squads of their men, who had previously been taken prisoners, marched past us. A natural curiosity to see how the vanquished veterans took the new order of things prompted some interchange of remarks, but we heard nothing insulting, nothing even of an exultant character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, boys, it's all over at last;</q> <q direct="unspecified">You can go home now,</q> and other such expressions, evinced the kind feeling of the victors, while in return they received from the vanquished, <q direct="unspecified">Bully for you, boys!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/><q direct="unspecified">We are glad it's over, any way,</q> and other remarks of like character, showing <pb id="p.425" n="425"/> that these friendly feelings were reciprocated; but a more extended conversation with the members of the surrendered army showed some bitterness left still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>Dinner was served in a tent on the common, and after the customary speech-making was over, followed by a social good time, the young ladies in attendance captured our flag, and falling into line, escorted us to the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>That which I have undertaken to say of this Company is now completed, and its closing chapters have been written with sincere regret; for the task of tracing its history from the enlistment of its members to the close of the war has been <num value="1">one</num> of unalloyed pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>During its progress my imagination has been peopled with the spirits and scenes of the conflict, and I have fought over again the old fights and lived over the old camp life so vividly, at times, as to regret the absence of the reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>It would have been possible to introduce into these pages some of the jealousies and feuds common, as we have reason to believe, to all military bodies, but no interest germane to the object sought in issuing the work could have been sub-served by them, while their perpetuation would be undesirable in many respects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>The good deeds of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> have not been unduly magnified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>The time has passed when either <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> party to the war can successfully claim the achievement of prodigies that never occurred.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>Nor have I intended to underrate the calibre of our antagonists in writing up the <rs>Company</rs>, for, obviously, there must be at least <num value="2">two</num> parties to a well contested field, and I firmly believe that no braver men were ever banded in an unrighteous cause than constituted the <rs>Rebel</rs> <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>&mdash;unquestionably the flower of the <rs>Southern</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>They fought with a valor that would have insured success had the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles been on their side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>To defeat such an army was glory enough; to be defeated by them, no disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>But my present purpose is not with this phase of the late conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>I only wish to emphasize the good character and excellent fighting material of the <rs>Company</rs> as a whole, and cite as weighty evidence bearing on this position the incontrovertible statement that the men never turned their backs upon the foe, unless by order, whenever there was an available shot in the limber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4806"/>Nor was the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> ever driven from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4807"/>Further, no man was ever accused of <pb id="p.439" n="439"/> leaving his post in time of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>Skulking to the rear when duty called at the front was never charged against any member of the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>,&mdash;a boast whose merit will be regarded as sufficient warrant for its making by those who know how general skulking was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>At <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> we were transferred to the steamer <q direct="unspecified"><placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">City of New York</placeName>,</q> which soon cast off and started for <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 7" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName>, where was located the camp for paroled and exchanged prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>Our feelings at this moment can possibly be imagined, but it was an ecstasy of joy I cannot describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>But so weak and shattered were many of the men released, that the reaction was too much for them, and several passed away before reaching their destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <q direct="unspecified">square meal</q> we had after our capture was obtined on board this steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>It consisted of hardtack, bread, cheese, and coffee, but such was the condition of the digestive organs of some of the prisoners that death soon followed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>When the ammunition of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> piece was exhausted, nothing remained to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>The gun's crew, therefore, fell back to the next piece, and the next,&mdash;and so on, each gun firing its last round in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>The other guns' crews fell back as we did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>These <num value="2">two</num> cannoneers got safely off of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>Those of us who fell back along the works kept on as far as the traverse which separated our left piece from the right <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName type="mil" key="RIBattery">Rhode Island Battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>How many of the boys of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">Tenth</num> were at that spot I cannot say. I remember only <num value="1">one</num>, beside myself, but there must have been many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>Looking toward the right, the scene was frightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>The ground was thickly strewn with the dead and wounded of both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>Many of the infantry who had gathered courage enough to try a dash towards the rear, were seen to fall as they ran, and in the middle ground lay the gory heaps of our poor horses, who had stood with such unflinching firmness under the terrible tempest of shells and bullets which had swept the plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>The victorious Rebels were advancing, evidently in high spirits, as well they might be. Hundreds of the wretched fellows who had failed so miserably in their duty as support to the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, lay huddled under the works, too terrified <pb id="p.448" n="448"/> even to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>It may be imagined that our feelings were bitter enough when we learned, some months afterward, that <num value="1">one</num> of the New York papers, in its account of the battle, had stated that the <orgName type="regiment" key="4NYHvArtillery">Fourth New York Heavy Artillery</orgName> had manned the runs of our Battery after we had fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>There was, however, <num value="1">one</num> exception to the poltroonery which most of these poor creatures displayed: <persName n="Williams,Major,Frank,,," id="n0245.0023.00448.03517" reg="default:Williams,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>, of the above regiment, rallied about a score of his men, and charged upon the vastly superior force of the enemy with the utmost gallantry; but bravery was of no avail: all of his party were soon killed or captured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>The enemy continued firing as they bore down upon us, and it seemed to be their intention to kill us all; and, as we had no weapons, we could only stand up and take it. A Rebel, at the distance of <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure>, drew his rifle to his shoulder and aimed in such a direction that I could look, as it seemed, directly into the muzzle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>I was certain that my time had come to die. After a moment's pause he fired, and I was surprised to find myself unhurt; but a man at my side, and partly behind me, sunk down with a groan, shot in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>The next minute I felt the cold muzzle of a Rebel lieutenant's pistol just behind my ear, and heard a command, in most abusive language, to get over the works and go to the <rs>Rebel</rs> lines; which I obeyed at once.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>When we reached the open level field which lay behind the low ridge where their guns had been posted, we saw at least <num value="2">two</num> brigades which they had not brought into the fight at all; so, very likely, the result might have been the same if our support had been a help instead of a hindrance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>It would be a natural supposition that the <measure n="2000" type="prisoners">two thousand prisoners</measure> who met in that field were full <pb id="p.449" n="449"/> of sorrow and dreadful forebodings; but nothing could be farther from the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>The flush and excitement of battle were still on us too strongly to allow us to think of what we should have to endure in Rebel prisons, and our conduct was more like that of victors than vanquished; as <num value="1">one</num> after another of a regiment or battery met his fellows, the handshaking and loud salutations were renewed, and the air rang with our talk and laughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>Occasionally a shot from a Union gun would come obliquely over the field, and the prisoners shouted and jeered to see the <rs>Rebels</rs> dodge and break ranks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>They took our chaff very good-naturedly; indeed, to do them justice, their conduct towards us was very kind and friendly, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>I had received a new felt hat from home that morning, which a ragged Rebel took possession of without much ceremony; and a. few other instances occurred of similar seizures; but I feel bound to say, that, as our enemies had showed the most desperate courage in the battle, they proved themselves humane when the victory was assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>But when I speak of humanity, it must be remembered that I speak only of the actual fighting-men, as will be seen further on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>We remained in the field I have spoken of for perhaps an hour, and then took up the line of march for <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, not by a direct course, for fear of recapture, but making a detour towards the south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>Our exhilaration had by this time subsided, and the feelings naturally to be looked for had taken its place, and that evening's march was indeed a gloomy <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>To add to our depression of spirits, it soon began to rain, and when we halted for the night, about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, the wet grass was our bed, and the pouring clouds our covering, until the <pb id="p.450" n="450"/> march was resumed at about <num value="4">four</num> next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>Most of us had been taken in our fighting costume of shoes, pantaloons, shirt, and hat. The only articles I took into <placeName reg="Libby Prison">Libby Prison</placeName>, beside these pieces of clothing, were a towel and an old condensed-milk can, and few of us had much more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>This day's march was exceedingly severe, for the sun was unclouded, and shone down upon us with its full <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> fierceness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>Water was scarce, and if it had been plentiful, we could have done no more than dip up a little in our hands as we passed along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>The guards were changed twice, if my memory does not deceive me; but for us there was no relief, nothing but an incessant tramp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>We sometimes met parties of Rebels on the way, who seemed much pleased at having taken so many of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName>. <q direct="unspecified">I reckon we have got about all of <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00450.03518" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,Winfield,S.,,:3"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s Butterflies,</q> they would say. <q direct="unspecified">Go to <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName>, and see!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>was the bitter rejoinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>This generally put an end to their questions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>Several times we encountered officers who were looking for our gallant corps commander himself, the story having reached <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> that he was among the captives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/><q direct="unspecified">Where's Hancock?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>Where's Hancock?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>they asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/><q direct="unspecified">You'll hear from him within <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>,</q> we replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>They took our retorts in perfectly good part, as if they could make allowance for our condition, and knew the dismal place we were going to. At about <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> we were allowed to rest in a thin grove of pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>At this place I had the exceedingly good fortune to find a condensed-milk can, which I used afterwards in <placeName reg="Libby, Cleburne, Arkansas" key="tgn,2446819">Libby</placeName> to hold my ration of pea-soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>Had <num value="1">1</num> not found this I must have gone without my soup, in which case I might not have been now where I am. <pb id="p.451" n="451"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>It was a little before sunset when we reached <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>I was surprised to see, in the outskirts, how every spot sheltered from the bombardment had been seized upon as a dwelling-place by those whose residences were in the more exposed part of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>The citizens were living there in scores, in all kinds of habitations,&mdash;tents of cotton-duck; wigwams of poles tied together at the top, and covered with bed-quilts; booths of boughs of pine-trees; and now and then a log-cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>As we filed through the streets we were pleased to see that many of the houses had great gaps in their walls, made by the passage of our shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>We were fortunate enough to pass the church by whose clock it was the fashion of our men to set their watches when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came in sight of the town, so as to be able to give each other <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> time, until a <measure n="3inch" type="distance">three-inch</measure> shot tore through it, completely upsetting its internal economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>The citizens looked rather black as we pointed up to it, but our guard only laughed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>We passed the night on an island in the river, and in the morning we were counted, searched, and robbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>Everything of value was taken from us. The search was especially keen for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>Their own currency was exceedingly plentiful, and correspondingly worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>We had been much surprised, the day before, when we were led through the town, to have little boys come to us to buy buttons from our blouses, offering <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> a piece for them, and showing the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>Some of these boys tried to find a Yankee with a watch to sell, and went about with a handful of Confederate promises to pay, shouting that they would give <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> for a <rs n="silver watch" type="product">silver watch</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>I had a little experience of my own in regard to the value of Rebel scrip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/><persName n="Glidden,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00451.03519" reg="mostcommon:Glidden,Oscar,F.,,:5"><surname>Glidden</surname></persName>&mdash;my <q direct="unspecified">partner,</q> <pb id="p.452" n="452"/> as we used to call it in those days&mdash;found a razor in the grass on this island, which he sold for <measure n="12dollars" type="currency">twelve dollars</measure>; and we both felt considerably elated, for we thought that if provisions ran short in prison we could buy extras with all that money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>This was <name>Saturday</name> forenoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>We had had nothing to eat since Thursday forenoon,&mdash;just before the fight,&mdash; so we thought it best to buy a little bread to break our long fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>It took the whole of the money to buy <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> biscuits</hi>, and the vender was by no means desirous to sell even at that.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>By some inquiry and comparison we found that a dollar of our paper money was worth <num value="20">twenty</num> of theirs, and considering the price of gold, the actual value of Rebel scrip must have been about the same as that of the old <placeName key="tgn,2079875" n="1.000 33" reg="hanersville, gallia, ohio">Gallipolis</placeName> bank of which the story went that you could buy wood with it at the rate of cord for cord.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>That afternoon they issued a ration to us: <num value="4">four</num> mouldy hard-tack, to last us until we should reach <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00452.03520" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>A little before sunset we were started for the train of platform cars which were to take us to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>To reach them we were obliged to march about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> out, for the <measure n="13inch" type="distance">thirteen-inch</measure> mortar, the <rs>Dictator</rs>, which we had seen a month before on the <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> road as we came back from <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName>, dropped its shells so neatly on the railroad just out of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> that the track was impassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>We had watched the mortar practice at the <rs>Union</rs> end with pleasure and interest, and now, at the <rs>Rebel</rs> end, observed its effects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>We were crowded on the cars and very slightly guarded, as it seemed to me, for there were not more than <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="6">six</num> guards to a car, and perhaps some of us might have escaped by suddenly pushing them off. But the risk was certainly very great, and the <pb id="p.453" n="453"/> probability of reaching our own lines exceedingly small; so, though <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of us whispered a suggestion to each other, nothing was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>The guards were the very soul of good-nature and treated us with great consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>At <placeName reg="Chesterfield Station">Chesterfield Station</placeName> the train halted for a few moments, and I asked an old man, a civilian, who stood by the track, what time it was. <q direct="unspecified"><name>Yankee</name> time!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>said the old fellow; not a very bad insult, but <num value="1">one</num> of our keepers, who heard him, rated him soundly for his incivility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>I mention the good feeling of the actual fighters because it was in such marked contrast with the conduct of the <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guard</orgName> and playsol-diers who took charge of us the moment we arrived in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>With oaths and curses we were driven into the street, sometimes at the point of the bayonet, and were marched to <placeName reg="Libby, Cleburne, Arkansas" key="tgn,2446819">Libby</placeName> with jeers and execrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>The hunger we had endured we thought little of; similar experiences had not been unknown when wagon trains had failed to come up; but the brutality so suddenly showered upon us brought to us all the realization that we were indeed prisoners of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>In <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00453.03521" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Inferno</q> the gates of Hell bore the inscription, <q direct="unspecified">All hope abandon, ye who enter here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>The words came into my mind with frightful force that night; the street was just light enough to enable us to see the pale faces pressed up to the bars; the corpse of a newly slain prisoner lay in its blood on the pavement near the door; and the door-way itself was a. great square mass of blackness, for nothing was visible within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>They forced us in, closed and barred the door, posted the guard, and left us to our reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>That it was an exceedingly miserable time for us I need not say. It was as dark as a pocket; there was no room to lie down or for many <pb id="p.454" n="454"/> even to sit; sleep was of course impossible, and we spent the rest of the night wondering what would be the end of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>At about <num value="8">eight</num> the next morning we were taken, <num value="200">two hundred</num> or so at a time, up <num value="2">two</num> flights of stairs, to the rooms which were to be our jails; and there <persName n="Turner,,Dick,,," id="n0245.0023.00454.03522" reg="default:Turner,Dick,,,"><foreName>Dick</foreName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> robbed us again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>There was not much to reward his industry,&mdash;we had been too thoroughly searched by the <rs>Petersburg</rs> thieves for that,&mdash;and when he had stolen everything he could find he left us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>With the idea of humiliating us, a negro with a club was stationed at the door, but it may be imagined that he did us no harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>In the greenness of my soul I asked him what we were to keep our rations in when they were dealt out. <q direct="unspecified">You won't be troubled with rations,</q> he answered, and his words came true.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>I have told the story in detail so far; but we were now fairly entered on our prison life, and <num value="1">one</num> day was like another, so it will not be necessary to particularize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>Our daily life was as follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/>We got up off the floor at daybreak, cold and numb and lame, and when the sun rose and shone a little while into the <num value="2">two</num> eastern windows, we gathered there to enjoy his rays as flies do when they begin to feel old and stiff in autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>Then we would go to our own part of the room; for we formed little squads, and had our own territory which we never left by day. The <orgName type="regiment" key="10Battery">Tenth Battery</orgName> squad had, as I believe, the most eligible camping ground in the whole room, for it was on the side next the river and had <num value="2">two</num> windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5008"/>Here we sat until the sweepers came,&mdash;<num value="3">three</num> negroes with a broom and <num value="1">one</num> with <num value="0.5">a half</num> barrel,&mdash;whose business was to sweep the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>They were under command of a tall, thin, and sour Georgian who made it his occupation to <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> see that we held no communication with the sweepers: a task quite out of his power to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5010"/>A few would begin to argue with him about the war, and he would take fire at once and forget everything else, and while he was telling us for the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> time, <q direct="unspecified">You uns had no business to come down here to fight we uns. If you uns had stayed where you belong there wouldn't have been any war,</q> the others got all the news of the day from the negroes, and those who had money sent out by them to get things to eat. Sometimes the value of their money came back to them and sometimes not.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5011"/>In this way we learned the news of the fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and taunted the <rs>Georgian</rs> with it. He denied it as long as he could, and ended by drawing a pistol and commanding silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5012"/>After the sweepers had gone, the next excitement was the entrance of pompous <persName n="Turner,Major,,,," id="n0245.0023.00455.03523" reg="nearbymention:Turner,Dick,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00455.03524" reg="mostcommon:Dick,nomatch:0"><surname>Dick</surname></persName>'s brother, by whose orders we were formed in <num value="2">two</num> ranks up and down the room while he counted us. What he would have done if he had found his birds short in <num value="1">number I</num> can neither tell nor imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5013"/>This brought us to about <time value="9:30">half-past 9</time>, when we devoted ourselves for the next half-hour to waiting for breakfast which was due at <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>Those whose territory lay at the street end of the room had the excitement of watching for the negroes who brought the rations in greasy tubs from the cook-house across the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>When we heard the joyous cry <q direct="unspecified">Fall in</q> we gathered in our respective squads and waited for the welcome food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>The bulk of meat and bread was divided into as many parts as there were squads, and the chief man of every squad divided these portions into as many parts as there were men in a squad; then <num value="1">one</num> turned his back and was asked, <q direct="unspecified">Who shall have this lot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5017"/>this lot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/>this lot?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5019"/>and so on until all were disposed of. <pb id="p.456" n="456"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>The next half-hour was always a time of great enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/>We ate slowly to prolong the pleasure, gathered up the smallest crumbs that had fallen, and picked every atom of meat from the bones; but the end of the feast would come at last.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>I will describe these rations a little more fully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5023"/>The bread was of the coarsest description, made of corn, ground cob and all, and not finely ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5024"/>I have lately read that chemists say there is a good deal of nourishment in cobs, but I think they do not look for it in the same way as we did, for we looked in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>Of this bread, such as it was, we got about <num value="4">four</num> ounces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>The meat was of a character which made it a fitting companion for the bread, and, poor as it was, they gave us only about <num value="3">three</num> ounces, including the bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>We liked to have a bone fall to our share because it took so long to pick it, and some bones, the ends of the ribs for example, had soft places in them which we could chew and try to think that we were eating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/><num value="1">One</num> day we had a fine lot of bones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/><persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n0245.0023.00456.03525" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> had captured a herd of cattle from the <rs>Union</rs> army, and the heads were boiled and sent in to us after the cheeks, brains and tongues had been removed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5030"/>The next meal&mdash;the <hi rend="italics">other</hi> meal I should say&mdash;was not until <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon, and there was a great deal of time on our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5031"/>We passed this in various ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5032"/>Somebody had managed to save a pack of cards, and those who liked played until so many of the cards were lost that no game could be carried on; others sat and talked the time away, telling all the adventures that never happened to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5033"/><num value="1">One</num> day I found a piece of laurel wood, and made a spoon which I still keep as a memento of that dismal time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5034"/>I also marked my tin can with my name, and around the rim I cut <persName n="Lovelace,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00456.03526" reg="mostcommon:Lovelace,nomatch:0"><surname>Lovelace</surname></persName>'s lines, <pb id="p.457" n="457"/> <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00457.03527" reg="mostcommon:Stone,A.,P.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName> walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage,</q> and thought as I did so that the poet did not know about these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5035"/>In some way or other, <num value="3">three</num> books had escaped the clutches of the <num value="2">two</num> sets of thieves who had robbed us. These were a Bible, which I read completely through; a copy of <persName n="Braddon,Miss,,,," id="n0245.0023.00457.03528" reg="mostcommon:Braddon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Braddon</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Audley,Lady,,,," id="n0245.0023.00457.03529" reg="mostcommon:Audley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Audley</surname></persName>'s Secret</hi>, which I also read, but without much enjoyment; and <hi rend="italics">The Arabian Nights</hi>, a book whose absurdity and childishness were too much for me, even in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5036"/>We used oftentimes to sit and gaze at a field of corn which grew on the south bank of the river, hardly a stone's throw away, and say to each other, <q direct="unspecified">Oh, if I were only in that cornfield!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5037"/>Other objects which whiled away the weary prison day were the occasional passage of a tug up or down the canal, or a group of turkey-buzzards hovering about some choice bit on the river bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5038"/>It was hazardous to approach the window near enough to be seen by the sentries, for it was at once their delight and their orders to shoot any <num value="1">one</num> who did so. Yet we were never warned by any <num value="1">one</num> in authority to keep back, nor did the sentry often take the trouble to give any orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5039"/>The sight of a musket being brought into position was generally the only intimation of danger before the discharge of the piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5040"/>We did sometimes venture, however, and it gave us unfeigned satisfaction to see how thickly the grass was growing between the paving-stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5041"/><num value="1">One</num> day&mdash;it was the <dateStruct value="-09-13"><day reg="13">13th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, I believe&mdash;we heard heavy cannonading down the river, and could even see Union shells exploding in the air. Pretty soon a string of fugitives appeared coming up the canal bank, among them an old lady in a high-wheeled chaise and with a lapful of <rs n="silver ware" type="product">silver ware</rs>, who was frantically urging on an old horse which was wholly <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> unable to satisfy her desire for rapid transit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5042"/>We made sure that our side had gained some great advantage and saluted the shells with cheers, to the great disgust of the sentries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5043"/>Some of the prisoners managed, <num value="1">one</num> day, to cut out a piece of the flooring so as to communicate with the prisoners on the floor below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5044"/>The Rebel authorities suspected this, but they never could find the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5045"/>The negro sweepers must have known where it was, but they never told.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5046"/>In these ways the wretched days dragged on. At <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, each day, a shout from the northern end of the room gave notice that our luxurious supper was about to be served; this consisted of another piece of the apology for bread, which we by no means sneered at then, and bean, or rather pea broth, about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of a pint to each man. It was very galling to see those worthless negroes pour out some of it into the street when the tubs were a little heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5047"/>This stuff was made of the cowpea, raised as a forage crop at the <rs>South</rs>; and these peas, like others, were full of weevils to such an extent that their carcasses made a thick, black layer over the broth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5048"/>This was of a dark-red color, and we thought the flavor excellent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>We were as long as possible in eating supper, and when it was over we soon went to bed; that is, we went in a body to our chosen spot near the centre of the room, as far from the window as possible, and lay down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5050"/>There was no glass in the windows, and as the month was <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, and the prison on the river bank, it always became very cold before morning; so we used to lie down as close together as we could get, and when <num value="1">one</num> wanted to turn we all had to turn in concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5051"/>It took some time to get to sleep under such circumstances, and just as we were <pb id="p.459" n="459"/> getting into a doze the sentries were sure to wake us with their half-hourly cry, like this, <q direct="unspecified">Postnum-ber-<num value="7">seven</num>-half-past-<num value="12">twelve</num>-and-all's-well!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5052"/>But no person born north of <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00459.03530" reg="mostcommon:Mason,Charles,A.,,:8"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dixon,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00459.03531" reg="mostcommon:Dixon,George,M.,,:4"><surname>Dixon</surname></persName>'s line can reproduce the drawling whine of the <name>Georgians</name> who guarded us. <num value="1">One</num> night <num value="1">one</num> of them started out in full cry, <q direct="unspecified">Post <num value="2">number two</num> half&mdash;what time is it?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5053"/>The effect was very ludicrous, and we jeered and shouted at him for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5054"/>Late in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> we had a piece of good news, which, however, turned out to be false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5055"/>A crowd of prisoners arrived at <time value="12am">midnight</time>. Some <num value="1">one</num> among them shouted, <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0245.0023.00459.03532" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s got his machine to working.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5056"/>We supposed by this that the <rs type="place">Dutch Gap Canal</rs> had proved successful, and felt quite happy over it. So we turned to and fro until daybreak, when we rose and tried to hobble to the east window to get a minute's sunshine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5057"/>Thus the time passed for <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure>. During this period we always stopped eating while still hungry, as we are often told we ought to do; but the result was not such as to cause us to continue in the same course when not obliged to. At the end of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> week any sudden change of position was followed by ringing in the ears, darkness before the eyes, and great dizziness; and when <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure> were over and they took us out, we found that to go down stairs even with our lightened bodies was a severe trial to the strength of our knee-joints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>We were marched through the streets on that drizzly day to <placeName reg="Belle Isle, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,2161656">Belle Isle</placeName>, and found it a far worse place than that which we had left, in most respects, although exposure to the sun was quite a luxury to us. The population of the island, at that time, must have been about <num value="6000">six thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5059"/>The area of the prison pen was laid out in about <num value="60">sixty</num> streets, <pb id="p.460" n="460"/> branching out at right angles from a central avenue, <num value="30">thirty</num> on a side; these streets were numbered, and on each were the quarters of a <measure n="100" type="prisoners">hundred prisoners</measure>, their covering a condemned tent, their bed the ground, sometimes wet, sometimes not, according to the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5060"/>This camp was guarded by a strong line of sentries, and several pieces of cannon on a hill near at hand were trained upon the inclosure in case of a sudden outbreak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>I strolled out to see the place on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> afternoon, and was suddenly accosted with, <q direct="unspecified">Look out, dead line!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5062"/>from a prisoner who was better acquainted with the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5063"/>I looked up and saw the silent sentry just beginning to bring his rifle to position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>I disappointed him of his expected reward&mdash;a furlough&mdash;by stepping back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/><q direct="unspecified">Where's the dead line?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5066"/>I asked the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5067"/><q direct="unspecified">Anywhere within <num value="3">three</num> rods of the stockade,</q> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5068"/><q direct="unspecified">Sometimes nearer, sometimes not so near.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/>And we soon found that <q direct="unspecified">dead line</q> was wherever the sentry chose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>Some of these guards were friendly and would warn us, but the majority were quite the other way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>There was a daily count as there had been in <placeName reg="Libby, Cleburne, Arkansas" key="tgn,2446819">Libby</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>For this purpose we were all marched out of the stockade while our quarters were being searched, and were counted as we passed in again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5073"/>Some spent their time while outside in digging witch-grass roots out of the sand, getting as much as could be clasped in <num value="1">one</num> hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>I could not imagine what they did with this at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but found that they dried the roots and then used them to heat their pea broth; making for the purpose a circular wall of earth just large enough to set a tin can upon, leaving a draught hole and a place for the escape of the smoke, thus saving nearly every particle of heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5075"/>Once or twice a man tried to escape by burying himself <pb id="p.461" n="461"/> in the sand while outside and lying there all day, slipping into the river by night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/><num value="1">One</num>, I believe, got away while we were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>After dark it was exceedingly hazardous to move outside of the quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5078"/><num value="1">One</num> night we heard the report of a musket, followed at once by shrieks of agony, and we knew that <num value="1">one</num> more murder had been done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5079"/><num value="1">One</num> day cannonading was heard down the river, apparently at no great distance, and our hopes began to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>The guards were doubled, the artillerists were posted at the guns on the hill, and an officer came in and gave us notice that if more than <num value="2">two</num> men were seen talking together fire would be opened upon us. The cannonading continued, and feeling very little confidence in the forbearance of the guards we went into our tents, threw up breastworks and lay down behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5081"/>That, however, passed over; the firing died away, and our position was no more hazardous than before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> week of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> the prisoners began to be sent to <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2076487" n="1.000 5" reg="salisbury, rowan, north carolina">Salisbury</placeName>, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/><pb id="p.462" n="462"/> Looking around I saw that not a guard was in sight; it seemed as if it would be almost flying in the face of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> not to attempt to escape, but in a few minutes came the joyful news that we were to be paroled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>It seemed too good to be true, but true it was. After having had rations furnished us for the journey to the <rs>South</rs>, and while we were standing by the cars that were to take us, the orders were changed, and we were sent <name>North</name> instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>We took up the line of march to <placeName reg="Castle Thunder">Castle Thunder</placeName>, and there took oath not to serve against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> (so called) until exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/>The river at this point makes a wide sweep and comes back again nearly to the same place, so it was a short walk acoss the neck of the peninsula.
