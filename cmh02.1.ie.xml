<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>When the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> was disclosed to the <rs>Old</rs>, the belief of all civilized people was that the heathen had no rights which Christians ought to respect &mdash;that he and his country belonged of right to the strongest taker; and it became a curious article of a more curious faith that murder and robbery were efficient means for propagating the faith of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0240.0001.00003.00002" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and magnifying the glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The <rs>Pope</rs> made short work of the whole matter, for he divided the new world <name>east</name> and <name>west</name> by a degree of longitude and made a present of <num value="0.5">one-half</num> to the <name>Spaniard</name> and the other half to the <name>Portuguese</name>&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Ad majoram gloriam Dei</q>&mdash;to the greater glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>This process of simple division was not satisfactory to the fair-hai<rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">blue</rs>-eyed race that dominated the island in the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Love of enterprise, commercial daring, politics, religious conditions&mdash;all contributed to stimulate exploration and investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><num value="1">One</num> Englishman spent his life searching for <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">El Dorado</placeName>&mdash;the land where gold abounded; a Spaniard spent his hunting the <q direct="unspecified">Fons Vitae</q>&mdash;the fountain of perpetual youth, the waters of which renew forever the waning forces of vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>But while the <name>Spaniard</name> ransacked <num value="2">two</num> continents for <rs type="color">silver</rs> and <rs type="color">gold</rs>, found them and ruined his posterity, the <rs>French</rs>, actuated by no nobler ideals, made settlements in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>, the main inspiration of which was the desire to possess the great fisheries on the north-eastern coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The <rs>English</rs>, in the main, had higher aims, and wider, larger aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Political conditions at home exasperated religious <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> differences, and the only hope of liberty seemed to be to transplant the old institutions of Britain&mdash;liberty of person, security of property, freedom of thought&mdash;to the wilderness, and there secure them forever by the ancient safeguards devised by the experience, the wisdom and the courage of their ancestors&mdash;habeas corpus, trial by jury, representative self government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>So, at the beginning of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, many gentlemen in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> emigrated with their property and their servants to the forests of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, then including the north continent from the lakes to the gulf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>With them they carried the opinions of their time and generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The possession of the heathen was lawful and laudable sport for <name>Christian</name> men, and they straightway put them to the sword, seized their lands, their wives and their children, and divided them and all prisoners taken in war as slaves of the conquerors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This was the universal rule among all the <rs>English</rs> except in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the influence of <persName n="Penn,,,,," id="n0240.0001.00004.00003" reg="mostcommon:Penn,nomatch:0"><surname>Penn</surname></persName>, in the last that of the <name>Jesuits</name>, saved them from such crimes against humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But the necessities of the new society, the constant struggle with nature, the forest, the flood, the fire, all made involuntary and controlled labor exceedingly valuable, convenient, comfortable and necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>And when to the captive <rs>Indians</rs> were added cargoes of savage, cannibal Africans, no man could deny that it was a Christian duty to civilize them and teach them to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Therefore, involuntary servitude existed in all the <rs>English</rs> colonies from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and it was not until the <rs>American</rs> revolution stirred up generalizings and theories about the rights of man, that the idea got abroad that slavery was wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States it had long ceased to be necessary, for population had increased and roads been constructed, so that society was able to protect itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It was troublesome, annoying, unprofitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Slaves of different races&mdash;Indian, white and negro&mdash;confused the social order, and it was best to get rid of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But it was not as <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> a moral question, but as an economical <num value="1">one</num>, that it was dealt with.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>So when the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> by, through and under it were framed, formed and organized, it was silent on the subject of slavery by name, but provided for its protection by requiring that persons held to service, escaping from <num value="1">one</num> State to another, should be delivered and returned to their masters on demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Without this provision no constitution could have been adopted and no union formed</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But the cotton-gin was invented, by which the cultivation of cotton became extremely profitable and slaves became valuable property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There was a great movement of capital and population to the cotton country, and the new States rapidly grew up and demanded admission into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>By the gradual abolition of slavery north of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> the free States had been approaching control of the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, until the cotton-gin reversed the order, and it seemed as if the slave States would secure permanent control of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then began an agitation in the <rs>North</rs>, superficially moral and religious, but really and substantially political; professedly to do away with the great crime of slavery, in fact to check and destroy the aggrandizement of the <rs>Southern</rs> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> clear issue between the forces was on the application of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> to be admitted as a State of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was a slave State and her admission would destroy the equilibrium between the <num value="2">two</num> systems in the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>So <placeName key="tgn,7007523" n="1.000 5" reg="missouri">Missouri</placeName> was kept out until a free State could be hitched to her and thus the balance of power preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This was in <dateStruct value="1821--"><year reg="1821">1821</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In divers ways the struggle between the powers exhibited itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Congress for years had levied duties on imports, whereby Northern manufacturers were encouraged and protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Northern manufacturers were enriched and the rest of the country taxed for their benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct> a tariff law was passed which was resisted by <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and the issue of arms was only averted by the retreat of the <rs>Federal</rs> government, by concession and by compromise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The king of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at the beginning of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century claimed the proprietorship of the <rs>North American</rs> continent, which claim was disputed by the <name>Spaniard</name> in the <rs>South</rs> and the <rs>French</rs> in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> was hemmed and bounded by New Spain, New France, and the ambition and the courage and enterprise of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were roused to the conquest of the new world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The spirit that had shattered the <rs>Grand Armada</rs> and won for commerce the freedom of the seas, was directed to new countries and new States to be founded in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>, where the institutions, the habits, the sentiment and the society of their ancestors were to be transplanted, cultivated and developed, as they had been a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> before from the forests of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> to the shores of Britain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The leading nobility and gentry, sailors, soldiers, and merchants of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were aroused to this great enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They formed the <rs>Virginia</rs> company and received a grant from the king of that part of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> unoccupied by French or Spaniards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The enterprise of settlement, transportation and support of colonies proved too much for the company, and its grant was taken away with its charter, and the crown resumed its rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Then grants were made to individual proprietors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Noblemen and gentlemen about the court secured these great favors, which they hoped would be the foundation of fortune to their posterity, just as the grants of the <name>Norman</name> conqueror had founded great houses and families which had controlled <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for <measure n="6centuries" type="date">six centuries</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He, in association with <persName n="Arundel,Sir,Francis,,," id="n0240.0001.00006.00005" reg="default:Arundel,Francis,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <surname>Arundel</surname></persName> of Wardvin (whose daughter, <persName n="Arundel,Lady,Anne,,," id="n0240.0001.00006.00006" reg="default:Arundel,Anne,,,"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName> <surname>Arundel</surname></persName>, his son Coecilius married, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> applied for grants of land in the new country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Both died before the grant was prepared, and <persName n="Calvert,,Coecilius,,," id="n0240.0001.00007.00007" reg="default:Calvert,Coecilius,,,"><foreName>Coecilius</foreName> <surname>Calvert</surname></persName> then procured to be framed a charter or grant, which was the wisest and most liberal in its terms of any issued up to that time to an English subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The charter granted to him and his heirs forever the territory on the north of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and extending from the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic ocean</placeName> to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> springs of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and along the <num value="40" type="ordinal">40th</num> degree of north latitude from the <placeName key="tgn,7020648;tgn,1123359" n="0.017 000000.3410	placename;tgn,7020648;Delaware River, United States, North and Central America,United States,North and Central America;0.017 000000.3410	placename;tgn,1123359;Delaware, Kansas, United States,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="Delaware River, United States, North and Central America,United States,North and Central America;Delaware, Kansas, United States,Kansas,United States,North and Central America">Delaware river</placeName> to the meridian of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fountain of the <placeName key="tgn,2595792;tgn,7020782;tgn,7016159;tgn,7013269;tgn,2257292" n="0.011 000000.0682	placename;tgn,2595792;Potomac River, United States,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0341	placename;tgn,7020782;Hodgson Point, Saint Marys, Maryland,Saint Marys,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0341	placename;tgn,7016159;Piscataway, Prince Georges, Maryland,Prince Georges,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0341	placename;tgn,7013269;Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia,Alexandria,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0341	placename;tgn,2257292;Cornfield Point, Saint Marys, Maryland,Saint Marys,Maryland,United States,North and Central America" reg="Potomac River, United States,United States,North and Central America;Hodgson Point, Saint Marys, Maryland,Saint Marys,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;Piscataway, Prince Georges, Maryland,Prince Georges,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia,Alexandria,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Cornfield Point, Saint Marys, Maryland,Saint Marys,Maryland,United States,North and Central America">Potomac river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Together with this great grant of land and water, about <num value="13000">13,000</num> square miles, the proprietary was vested with all the powers of the <rs>Bishop</rs> of <persName n="Durham,,,,," id="n0240.0001.00007.00008" reg="mostcommon:Durham,nomatch:0"><surname>Durham</surname></persName>, who from the earliest times had exercised absolute dominion over the palatinate of <persName n="Durham,,,,," id="n0240.0001.00007.00009" reg="mostcommon:Durham,nomatch:0"><surname>Durham</surname></persName> and such power of martial law as was necessary in tempestuous times to preserve society and protect the border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The charter provided for self-government by the freemen; it secured them all the rights of Englishmen, and laid the solid foundation of a happy, friendly, contented society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The proprietary, in his capacity of palatine, regulated social laws and behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The motto of the <name>Calverts</name> is <q direct="unspecified">Fatti Maschii, Parole Foemine</q>&mdash;Deeds are manly, words are womanly, or as it has always been rendered, <q direct="unspecified">Courage and Chivalry.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The standard of the proprietary was borne in battle by a grand standard-bearer, who was an officer of great dignity and authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><num value="1">One</num> was killed at the battle of the <rs>Severn</rs>, between the <name>Cavaliers</name> and Roundheads, in <dateStruct value="1654--"><year reg="1654">1654</year></dateStruct>, and his widow received a grant of land and was treated with great distinction by the proprietary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But the controlling force of the colony was the spirit of <placeName key="tgn,7021987;tgn,7013352" n="0.023 000000.1364	placename;tgn,7021987;baltimore independent city, maryland, united states,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.011 000000.0682	placename;tgn,7013352;baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland,Baltimore Independent City,Maryland,United States,North and Central America" reg="baltimore independent city, maryland, united states,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;baltimore, baltimore independent city, maryland,Baltimore Independent City,Maryland,United States,North and Central America">Baltimore</placeName>, who in his instructions to his governors insisted that there should be no broils about religion or politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Every man should be secured in the right to his opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Free thought was guaranteed to every <persName n="Marylander,,,,," id="n0240.0001.00007.00010" reg="mostcommon:Marylander,nomatch:0"><surname>Marylander</surname></persName>, and free speech as well, except so far as free speech infringed on the rights of his neighbors, when it was strictly suppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Therefore, in the very foundation of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> was deeply laid the idea of toleration of different opinions among neighbors, of consideration for their feelings, and, as a logical consequence, of readiness at all times to help them, to protect them, and to assist them in all the struggles of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There never was a more homogeneous, sentimental society than that planted on the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">One</num> for all and all for <num value="1">one</num></q> was the animating spirit for generations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>While the northern settlements were torn and blooddrenched and fire-blasted by intolerance, when the flames of burning witches lighted <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and the air echoed with the lash of whipped Baptists, no man was ever molested for his opinions in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>&mdash;while Marylanders controlled the palatinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Several times during that stormy epoch, which cost a king his crown in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the people their liberties, there had been struggles between the <name>Cavalier</name> and Roundhead parties in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, in which the latter were successful as their friends and relatives in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>But in all that tension of feeling there was never but <num value="1">one</num> issue of arms in which blood was spilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Therefore <placeName key="tgn,7007516" n="1.000 164" reg="maryland">Maryland</placeName> grew and prospered without those bitter memories which in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> separated class from class and divided neighbor from neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>And whenever their neighbors on the south side of the <rs>Potomac</rs> were harassed by the savages on their borders, the <name>Marylanders</name> were prompt and generous in spending life, blood, and treasure in their defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>There never was an Indian war in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The policy of the palatine, so broad and generous and just, prevented quarrels with the natives, and they were always friendly with the <name>Marylanders</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>There were bloody invasions from south of the great river, from the west and from the north, but no rising ever occurred of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0240.0001.00008.00011" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Generosity with justice was the fundamental rule of dealing with them, and this rule of right acts upon all who practice it, as well as upon those on whom it is practiced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Respect for the weak, regard for <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> the truth, a willingness and a desire to help those who need help, become controlling principles of life, and selfishness is eradicated as much as it is possible for human nature to be changed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Thus developed the <rs>Maryland</rs> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Love of country and of friends, regard for truth and justice, toleration of differences of opinion, for <num value="5">five</num> generations had been the directing influence of their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It raised money and provisions which it sent to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and, inasmuch as the port of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> was closed to trade, formed an association pledging the people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, men, women and children, never to use any imported goods until justice was done to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, just as <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> before it had refused to recognize the <name n="Stamp Act" type="legislation">Stamp Act</name>.
