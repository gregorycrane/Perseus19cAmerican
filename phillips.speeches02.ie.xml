<head>Prefaratory note.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/><measure n="28years" type="date">Twenty-eight years</measure> ago, in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, <emph><persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0189.0001.00002.00001" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName></emph> yielded to the solicitations of his friends, and revised for publication a selection of his Speeches, Lectures, and Letters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The moment was well chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand public interest in the <name>Antislavery</name> question, the constant burden of the orator's utterance, had widened and deepened with the progress of the war, and had reached its height when the <rs>Emancipation Proclamation</rs> appeared; and on the other hand, the personal popularity of <emph><persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0001.00002.00002" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName></emph> was steadily rising throughout the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Both these changes account in part for the welcome the volume at once received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>But its permanent place among the records of American eloquence is due to deeper and intrinsic reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The classic is always contemporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>If the immediate occasion and subject of the speaker pass, the truth and conviction which inspire his appeal are not lost; and while the charm of voice and action may die with the moment, or survive only as a tradition, there is a deeper grace of form which makes the speech, as well as the poem, an eternal <pb id="p.-003" n="-003"/> possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>And the student of oratory will find no better or safer model than <emph><persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0001.00003.00003" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName></emph>, if he would seek direct, incisive speech, abundance and felicity of illustration, skill in applying truth to present needs, and, above all, the union of the highest gifts of eloquence with lightness of touch, a conversational reality of tone, and language level to the understanding of every hearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Such mastery of invective also, keen and graceful as a Damascus blade, it has well been said, lends new meaning to the term <quote>philippic.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Repeated calls have been made for other speeches of <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0001.00003.00004" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>At the time of his death he not only had a further selection in mind, but had revised certain lectures, and had promised a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> volume to the present publishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This collection, therefore, is intended as a partial fulfilment of his own purpose, no less than as an answer to the popular demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It illustrates the wide range of time and topic covered by his interest and his eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It begins with the earliest of his speeches, delivered <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> before the famous <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0189.0001.00003.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lovejoy,nomatch:0"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName> address which stands <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the other volume, and closes with his last public utterance, his tribute to the memory of <persName n="Martineau,,Harriet,,," id="n0189.0001.00003.00006" reg="default:Martineau,Harriet,,,"><foreName>Harriet</foreName> <surname>Martineau</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>An interval of over <measure n="46years" type="date">forty-six years</measure> separates the <num value="2">two</num> addresses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A glance at the table of contents shows how wide a variety of subjects has been treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Beside his recognized leadership in the <name>Antislavery</name> movement, he stands forth as an early champion of other reforms,--Woman's Suffrage, the <rs>Labor Agitation</rs>, Temperance, and Penal Legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The lighter play of his genius is seen in his <quote>Letter from <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName></quote> and his <quote>Address to the <orgName n="Boston School" type="school">Boston school</orgName> children.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>His literary lectures are <num value="4">IV</num> <pb id="p.-004" n="-004"/> given large prominence, and the book closes with <num value="6">six</num> personal tributes from his lips.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The present volume forms part of a larger plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The history of <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0001.00004.00007" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>'s relation to the <name>Antislavery</name> movement, the growth of his views and sentiments, and the development of his power and fame as an orator are reserved for another work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It will be illustrated by a series of speeches and selections not included in either of the volumes already published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It will follow his steps through contumely and hatred to honor and triumph such as few orators have known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It will set in strong relief the pure and lofty ideal of conscience and citizenship which he maintained to the end, untouched by flattery and undaunted by threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In connection with these earlier volumes, it will prove, it is hoped, a full and trustworthy record of the orator and agitator, and an enduring monument to his work and fame.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The editor and publishers return their grateful acknowledgments to <persName n="Yerrinton,Mister,J.,M.,W.," id="n0189.0001.00004.00008" reg="default:Yerrinton,J.,M.,W.,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Yerrinton</surname></persName>, the lifelong friend of <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0001.00004.00009" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, to whose skilful pencil the abiding memory of his eloquence is so largely due.</p>

<head>The right of petition.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At the <rs>Quarterly Meeting</rs> of the <rs>Massachusetts Antislavery Society</rs>, held in <placeName reg="Lynn, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050042">Lynn</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1837-03-28"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="28">28</day>, <year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct>, the following resolution was offered by <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0189.0003.00001.00015" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That the exertions of <persName n="Adams,the Honorable,John,Quincy,," id="n0189.0003.00001.00016" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, and the rest of the <rs>Massachusetts Delegation</rs> who sustained him, in his defence of the right of petition, deserve the cordial approbation and the gratitude of every <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech of <persName n="Phillips,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0003.00001.00017" reg="nearbymention:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, and marked his entrance upon the <name>Antislavery</name> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Another speech delivered by him on the same day and occasion will be found in a later volume.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>: <num value="1">One</num> of the previous resolutions of this meeting refers to the success of the cause of abolition within the last few months, and the bright hopes with which we may enter on another year of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The petitions which have loaded the tables of our State and National Legislatures may certainly be considered as <num value="1">one</num> great cause of that success, and the pursuing of the same course, the best ground of hope for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Such circumstances naturally fix every eye on that distinguished citizen to whom the resolution refers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>His course during the last session deserves the gratitude of every American; for in that contest, he was not the representative of any State or any party, <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> but the champion of the fundamental principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The right of petition we had thought as firmly fixed in the soil of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> as the <rs>Saxon</rs> race which brought it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was the breath of life during our colonial history, and is recognized on every page of our history since as the bulwark of civil liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Antiquity and the historical associations of our mother country had rendered it so sacred that we looked confidently to that for protection and redress, when all other means should fail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Upon the friends of abolition, of free discussion, of equal rights, throughout the land, insult had been heaped on insult, and outrage added to outrage, till we thought that malice had done its worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>All the outworks that guard the citadel of liberty had been in turn overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The dearest rights of freemen had been, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, torn from us. We had heard, at a time of profound peace, in the midst of our most crowded cities, the voice of the multitude once and again overwhelm the voice of the laws, almost without the shadow of an attempt at resistance on the part of the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Magistrate">civil magistrate</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We had seen a price set by a <orgName n="Southern Legislature" type="legislature">Southern legislature</orgName> on the head of a citizen of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, for presuming to think as he pleased, and to speak what he thought, within the borders of the old Commonwealth; and this insult had been answered only by a recommendation on the part of our own Executive that whoever dared to move the question of slavery should be proceeded against at common law. We had long known that we held our lives and property at the will of the mob; but now, as if by common consent, the <rs>North</rs> seems ready to yield to Southern threats the right to speak and to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><quote>The time had come when eloquence was to be gagged, and reason to be hoodwinked,</quote> We had heard in old <persName n="Faneuil,,,,," id="n0189.0003.00002.00018" reg="mostcommon:Faneuil,nomatch:0"><surname>Faneuil</surname></persName>, and from the <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> lips of those whose very names should have been a guaranty of their attachment to freedom, principles which would have blotted out every page of our past history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Borne down, but not dismayed,--confident that the hearts of the people, could the truth but reach them, were sound at the core,--we sought out the weapon which our fathers wielded; we besieged the doors of our State legislatures with petitions and remonstrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I need not tell the county of <placeName reg="Essex, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1002359">Essex</placeName> how that appeal was answered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Of that answer they have already taken note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> refuge left,--the government which our fathers established, <quote>to promote justice, and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There, at least, we might hope to find men able to look behind circumstances to principles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Who does not recollect the astonishment &mdash; for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> feeling was rather astonishment than indignation -with which we heard that the door of the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName> was closed to the voice of the people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It seemed as if the nation had been pressing on blindfold, and we opened our eyes only to behold the precipice over which we were rushing; as if the time-honored rights which had been fought for on <name>British</name> ground, and which our fathers had inherited, not won, were again to be struggled for. The car of Liberty had rolled back <measure n="4centuries" type="date">four centuries</measure>, and the contest whose history is written on the battlefields and scaffolds of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had been all in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Well might hope sicken, and the bravest despair.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>And who does not recollect the thrill of enthusiastic feeling with which we heard that <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n0189.0003.00003.00019" reg="nearbymention:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> had thrown himself into the gap, and was contending, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> single-handed, for the right of the citizen to petition, no matter what his creed, his color, or his party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The effort was the nobler in that he was not a member of the body of <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> men in whose persons this right had been invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>No interest of his or of his friends had been touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Against our efforts he had all along protested; but, statesman-like, he saw the end from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>When rights were invaded, he was willing to side with any who rallied to protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>How much truer to the name he bore than many others who stood higher in our esteem, and were dearer to us, than himself!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We hail him as the champion of free principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We accord to him the high merit of a pure attachment to civil liberty which would not permit her to be attacked, even when she appeared in the garb of a party which it was his interest, and he felt it to be his duty, to oppose; of a clear-sighted, far-reaching wisdom, which discovered the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach of corruption and snuffed oppression in the tainted breeze; of a noble disregard to party lines, when to have adhered to them would have compromised the fundamental principles of our government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The supineness of the <rs>North</rs> under the act of Southern aggression, and still more, the indifference with which <placeName reg="Calhoun, McLean, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038035">Calhoun</placeName>'s bill was generally received, are the strongest arguments we can offer to our fellow-citizens to induce them to look at this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Why, such a proposition on any other occasion would have set the whole country in a blaze!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It would have sent an electric shock through the land, and called forth from its slumbering retreats all the spirit of olden time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>What is it that thus palsies our strength and blinds our foresight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>We have become so familiar with slavery that we are no longer aware of its deadening influence on the body politic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><persName n="Pinkney,,,,," id="n0189.0003.00004.00020" reg="mostcommon:Pinkney,nomatch:0"><surname>Pinkney</surname></persName>'s words have become true: <quote>The stream of general liberty cannot flow on unpolluted through the mire of partial bondage.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>And this is the reason we render to those who ask us why we are contending <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> against Southern slavery,--that <hi rend="italics">it may not result in Northern slavery</hi>; because time has shown that it sends out its poisonous branches over all our fair land, and corrupts the very air we breathe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our fate is bound up with that of the <rs>South</rs>, so that they cannot be corrupt and we sound; they cannot fall, and we stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Disunion is coming, <hi rend="italics">unless</hi> we discuss this subject; for the spirit of freedom and the spirit of slavery are contending here for the mastery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>They cannot live together: as well, like the robber of classic fable, chain the living and the dead together, as bind up such discordant materials, and think it will last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><hi rend="italics">We</hi> must prosper, and a sound public opinion root out slavery from the land, or there must grow up a mighty slaveholding State to overshadow and mildew our free institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I have said, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, that we owe gratitude to <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0003.00005.00021" reg="nearbymention:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> for his defence of the right of petition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>A little while ago it would have been absurd to talk of gratitude being due to any man for such a service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It would have been said, <quote>Why, he only did his duty, what every other man would have done; it was too simple and plain a case to need a thought.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>But it is true that, now, even for this we ought to be grateful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>And this fact is another, a melancholy proof of the stride which the influence of slavery has made within a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It throws such dimness over the minds of freemen that what would once have been thought the alphabet of civil right, they hail as a discovery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But I will not wander from my subject to slavery; it is our own rights which are at issue; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cry that awakened the nation to the importance of that issue, was the voice of the <rs type="role" reg="Ex-President">Ex-President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>On that <quote>gray discrowned head</quote> were fixed, in awful suspense, the eyes of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Others came at length to his aid. I wish this resolution may pass, that, as far as in us lies, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> he may feel that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> echoes back his cry to arms, is ready to sustain him and his colleagues in their noble course, is girding herself for the contest,--and, come what may, will see to it that, however the lights of other States may flicker with the breeze, her torch shall burn bright and unchanging on the eminence which she has never deserted or betrayed. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>My dear <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n0189.0004.00007.00024" reg="nearbymention:Thompson,George,,,"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName>,--I am very sorry to say no to your pressing request, but I cannot come to <placeName reg="Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland" key="tgn,7017283">Glasgow</placeName>; duty takes me elsewhere.

<p>My dear friends, you have a most difficult task to perform; it is neither more nor less than the extirpation of slavery from the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Your opponents who appear the most formidable are the cotton and other planters in the southern parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; who, I am grieved to say, hold more than <num value="2000000">two million</num> of their fellow-creatures in the most cruel bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Now we know of these men, that they are living in the daily habits of injustice, cruelty, and oppression, and may be therefore said to have no true fear of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, nor any just sense of religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>You cannot, therefore, expect to have the same hold upon the consciences of these that you have upon the consciences of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>How then can you get at these so as to influence their conduct?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> way; you must endeavor to make them feel their guilt in its consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>You must endeavor, by all justifiable means, to affect their temporal interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>You must endeavor, among other things, to have the produce of free tropical labor brought into the markets of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and undersell them there; and if you can do this, your victory is sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/><pb id="p.17" n="17"/></p> 
<p>Now that this is possible, that this may be done, there is no question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The <orgName n="East India Company" type="company">East India Company</orgName> alone can do it of themselves, and they can do it by means that are perfectly moral and pacific, according to your own principles,--namely, by the cultivation of the earth, and by the employment of free labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>They may, if they please, not only have the high honor of abolishing slavery and the slave trade, but the advantage of increasing their revenue beyond all calculation: for, in the first place, they have land in their possession <num value="20">twenty</num> times more than equal to the supply of all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> with tropical produce; in the second place, they can procure, not tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, but tens of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of free laborers to work; in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, what is of the greatest consequence in this case, the price of labor with these is only from a penny to <num value="3">three</num> half-pence a day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I learn, too, from letters which I have seen from <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and from the <rs>Company</rs>'s own reports, that they have long been engaged &mdash; shall I say providentially engaged?--in preparing seeds for the cultivation of cotton there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Now, if we take into considerations all these previous preparations (by which it appears that they are ready to start), and add to this the consideration that they could procure, not tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, but tens of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of free laborers to work,--_ I speak from authority,--I believe that if they would follow up their plans heartily and with spirit, according to their means, in the course of <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> they would materially affect the price of this article at market, and in <num value="12">twelve</num> that they would be able to turn the tide completely against the growers of it in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It is not their policy to endeavor to raise and secure a high price in the market of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, for fear the eyes of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> should be turned to her possessions in the <rs>East</rs>, where, as they express it, there are no doubt exhaustless resources for the cultivation of cotton; for they see that if the attention of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> were directed to that quarter, <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> would lose the market and slavery together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>I think we sometimes tell the story of what he did with too little appreciation of how much it takes to make the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> move in the cold streets of a revolutionary epoch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>It is a very easy thing to sit down and read the history; it is a very easy thing to imagine what we would have done,--it is a very different thing to strike the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>It is a very hard thing to spring out of the ranks of common, every-day life &mdash; submission to law, recognition of established government--.and lift the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> musket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>It is an easy thing to fight when the blood is hot; but this man whose memory we commemorate to-night stepped out of common life, every-day quiet, and lifted his arm among the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> against the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>It is right, because every colored man has but <num value="1">one</num> thing to remember in life, and that is slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>All races are <num value="1">one</num>--they are a unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The white race is a unit, the <name>Caucasian</name> race is a unit, the black race is a unit--<num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>There is only <num value="1">one</num> great, terrible fact in regard to the colored race <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> at the present moment,--it is that <num value="1000000">millions</num> of it wear the chain; there is nothing for the rest of the race decent to do but to devote themselves to the breaking of that chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>[Applause.] All literature, all wealth, all patriotism, all religion, should gravitate toward emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Genius is worth nothing else now with the colored man, except as helping that argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>I would have you, as your friend <persName n="Rock,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0009.00071.00257" reg="mostcommon:Rock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Rock</surname></persName> suggested, thrifty, eloquent, industrious, successful, rich, able, only as an argument that the colored race has a right to a place side by side and equal with the white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>I wish I could impress this truth on every colored man. His race to-day is on trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>The world says it merits only chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The best thing he can do with his life, with his genius, with his wealth, with his character, is to throw them into the scale of the argument, and make pro-slavery prejudice kick the beam.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>I want to say another thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I do not believe in the argument which my learned and eloquent friend <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0189.0009.00071.00258" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> has stated in regard even to the <hi rend="italics">courage</hi> of colored blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>It is a hazardous thing to dare to differ with so profound a scholar, with so careful a thinker as <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0189.0009.00071.00259" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>; but I cannot accept his argument and for this reason,--he says the <name>Caucasian</name> race, each man of it, would kill <num value="20">twenty</num> men and enslave <num value="20">twenty</num> more rather than be a slave ;. and thence he deduces that the colored race, which suffers slavery here, is not emphatically distinguished for courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>I take issue on that statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>There is no race in the world that has not been enslaved at <num value="1">one</num> period.

The Slavonic race, of which we are a branch, is enslaved by <num value="1000000">millions</num> to-day in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>The <name>French</name> race has been enslaved for centuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Then add this fact,--no race, <hi rend="italics">not <num value="1">one</num></hi>, ever vindicated its freedom from slavery by the sword; we did not win freedom by the sword; we did not resist, we Saxons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>If you go to the catalogue of races that have actually abolished slavery by the sword, the colored race is the only <num value="1">one</num> that has ever yet afforded an instance, and that is <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>[Applause.] This white race of ours did not vindicate its title to liberty by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>The villeins of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, who were slaves, did not get their own liberty; it was gotten for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The only race in history that ever took the sword into their hands, and cut their chains, is the black race of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Let that fact go for what it is worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The villeinage of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> wore out by the progress of commerce, by the growth of free cities, by the education of the people, by the advancement of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>So I think the slavery of the blacks will wear out. I think, therefore, that the simple and limited experiment of <measure n="3centuries" type="date">three centuries</measure> of black slavery is not basis enough for the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>No; the black man may well scorn it, and say, <quote>I summon before the jury, <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, with her savage <num value="1000000">millions</num>, that has maintained <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> her independence for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3000years" type="date">three thousand years</measure>; I summon <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> with the arts; I summon <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> with the sword,--and I choose to be tried in the great company of the <num value="1000000">millions</num>, not alone!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>I have always found that before the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> this subject had, in fact, but <num value="2">two</num> points of difficulty, and, indeed, <num value="1">one</num> was of far more importance to the committee than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point is, the authority for capital punishment; and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the necessity or expediency of preserving it. I will say a few words on both.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>In the first place, <persName n="Chairman,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0010.00077.00278" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chairman</surname></persName>, what is the object of all punishment, in a civil community?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Of course, it is not to revenge any act committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>The idea of revenge is to be separated from the idea of punishment, when we speak of capital punishment, or any other punishment, in civil society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>Neither can it be said that punishment is the penalty of sin, properly speaking; that is sin in the eye of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, where an individual &mdash; a conscious, responsible individual &mdash; commits a wrong act, with a wrong motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Society has nothing to do with <hi rend="italics">motive</hi>; society punishes <hi rend="italics">acts</hi>. <num value="1">One</num> man, for instance, may commit <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> murder, and in reality, and in the sight of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, may not commit as much sin as another person who has merely stolen; because we all know that sin, moral guilt, is made up of <num value="2">two</num> elements,--the light that the individual had, and the criminal wish that he had to violate that light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> alone can know what light a man has in his own conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Strictly speaking, therefore, the word punishment ought never to be used in this connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Society does not, in fact, <hi rend="italics">punish</hi> as we usually make use of that term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/><hi rend="italics">Punishment</hi> belongs only to that Being who can fathom the heart, and find out motives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>This is a more important principle than it at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appears from this consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Many men approach this subject with the idea that there is some peculiar religious responsibility connected with it. <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00078.00279" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName>, in his work on capital punishment, has a leading train of thought to the effect that <quote>the land is stained with blood,</quote> in the phrase of the Old Testament, and that society has got something to do to free tile nation from the guilt of blood; but our ideas of civil government are entirely different from this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> objects that society has in inflicting <hi rend="italics">penalties,--that</hi> is the proper word, not <quote>punishment.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>According to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Brougham</foreName></persName> in his letter to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyndhurst</foreName></persName> on this very topic, these objects are,--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to prevent the individual offender from ever repeating his offence; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to deter others from imitating his offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>The primary object of all government is protection,--protection to persons and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>That protection is to be gained in <num value="2">two</num> ways,--by taking the individual murderer, or the individual thief, and by putting him to death, or shutting him up, to prevent his recommitting his offence; and by so arranging the penalty on that man as to deter others from imitating his example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/><pb id="p.79" n="79"/></p> 
<p>In that definition, <persName n="Chairman,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0010.00079.00280" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chairman</surname></persName>, have I not included the whole object of penalty in the eye of civil government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>You observe that this <hi rend="italics">must be</hi> the whole object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>For instance,--a man who undertakes to commit murder, but does not do it, is guilty of murder in the eye of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>If I load a pistol and fire it at a man, and miss him, I am a murderer in the eye of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; I am not a murderer in the eye of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Society looks upon the act, not upon the intention or motive of the individual; and, therefore, only that Being who fathoms motives, who lets down the plummet of His infinite knowledge into the complex machinery of the human heart, and learns how much good has been resisted, how much education has been smothered,--only He can punish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>If I am right in this, the only things left are restraint of the specific individual culprit, and restraint by deter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>ring imitators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>That is the object of penalties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Well, then, we come to the penalty of the gallows,--the taking away of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>In the first place,--to look at it abstractly,--is it necessary in order to restrain the murderer, or to deter others from imitating him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>It manifestly is not necessary in order to restrain the murderer; because society is now so settled in its arrangements, so perfectly stereotyped in its shape and form, that you can put a man between <num value="4">four</num> walls and keep him there his whole life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> can build prisons strong enough to keep a man, and enact statutes strong enough to prevent him from being pardoned out. No man will pretend before this Committee that that part of the object of penalty which would prevent the man from repeating his offence obliges you to take his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>You can shut him up just as securely in a prison as in a grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>It is not necessary, then, to restrain the criminal; nobody pretends it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>Is it necessary for the simple purpose of deterring <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> others from like offences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Will the taking of the man's life deter others from following in his steps?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>That is the only question that remains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>When we look at the gallows &mdash; what is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>It is the taking of human life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> questions which present themselves in connection with this subject: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>Have we a right to take it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/><num value="2">2</num>. Are we obliged to take it. <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>Does it do any good to take it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>In other words,--the right, the obligation, and the necessity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>With regard to the matter of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>If the <rs>Massachusetts Declaration</rs> of Rights is of any authority in this hall, if the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> page of your Constitution is of any authority here,--then it would be hard to show where you get the power to take life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/><quote>The body politic,</quote> says the <name>Preamble</name> to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <quote>is formed by a voluntary association of individuals; it is a social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>That is the republican theory of government; it is the theory of this country, as you know, ever since the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>It is a compact between individuals to be governed in a certain form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Society, therefore, can have no rights higher than those the individual has to give to it. If you will read the <name>Declaration</name> of Rights of the <rs>Massachusetts Constitution</rs>, you will see that our form of government is a partnership of the individuals composing the body politic, and of course, a partnership cannot have any property except what the individual members give to it. Now an individual man has no right over his own life,--suicide is sin. If government is a compact, a partnership of rights which we individually surrender, where do you get the right to take life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The parties that make the compact have not got it, and therefore they cannot give it to the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Your legislature, according to that Constitution, has no rights <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> except what the people have given them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>The people have no right to take their own lives, and of course they cannot give you the right to take their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>If your Constitution is correct, therefore, you have no right to take life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>I do not say the <rs>Constitution</rs> is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>I know there are theories which repudiate the idea of compact, and claim that government derives its authority directly from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Your Constitution says that government is a <quote>compact</quote> among the people; and a government founded on that basis cannot have the right to take life, unless the individual has the right to take his own,--unless suicide is justifiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/><rs type="role" reg="Reverend">The reverend</rs> gentlemen who have appeared before you in opposition to the petitioners, would not allow for a moment that I have the right to commit suicide; but if I have not the right to take my own life, how can I give that right to <persName n="Gardner,Governor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00081.00281" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName>, or to a jury of <num value="12">twelve</num> men?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>These gentlemen escape from this by throwing overboard the whole theory of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>They say society is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> a compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>They upset the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> and the <rs>Massachusetts Constitution</rs>, and maintain that government is derived from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and in that way they get the idea of capital punishment from the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>: for you cannot get it any where else,--it must be got from the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, if got at all. Overthrowing the <rs>Massachusetts Constitution</rs>, they erect you into a government by the ordinance of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>It is in fact the old divine right to govern, and having introduced that theory into <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>, they give you the right to take life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>And when they give you this right, they give it to you in a Hebrew verse of the Old Testament, which, they say, not only <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> confers the right, but actually enjoins it as an obligation, <quote>blood for blood!</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>They claim that this question lies entirely outside of the province of usual legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>That is a very suspicious claim, to begin with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>You are asked to give your support to a law which avowedly transcends your Constitution, on the ground that it belongs to the theory of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>But who says this is a <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Christian,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00082.00283" reg="mostcommon:Christian,nomatch:0"><surname>Christian</surname></persName></hi> government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>It recognizes the <name>Jew</name>, the <name>Mohammedan</name>, or anybody else, as a voter and entitled to an equality of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>I do not say, gentlemen, that the <hi rend="italics">spirit</hi> of Christianity does not permeate its laws; I simply say, this government does not recognize Christianity as an essential characteristic of its component parts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>You come now to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>You come now to this verse of the Old Testament; and upon this verse hangs the whole theory of government, the whole theory of this legislation on capital punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>I want you to bear in mind these observations, because it shows you that the thing claimed stands outside of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, outside of the whole theory of American government,--it is peculiar, essential, unique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>We come, then, to that verse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>It is an obligation, they say: <quote><hi rend="italics">Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Let us suppose, gentlemen, to begin with, that it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>We will not say that we are Christians and not Jews, and that this was addressed, in the first place, to Jews and not to Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Who can show that this is a command to Christians?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>It is a command to the <name>Jewish</name> nation, so far as we know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>But it is contended that this command stands behind the <name>Jewish</name> nation, and is addressed to the whole race, represented by <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00082.00284" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>Suppose we waive aside our objection, and consider it as a covenant with the race, through <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00082.00285" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>If this is a covenant, if it is a law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, if it is addressed <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> to us as the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,--it must be obeyed, fully, entirely obeyed; no man has a right to take exceptions to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>Is it not rather singular, gentlemen, that you should be asked to upset the whole theory of the <rs>American Constitution</rs>, to support a law which it is confessed transcends the <rs>American</rs> idea of the power of government, that you should be asked to take a right-<num value="1">one</num> of the most doubtful ever exercised, even if it should appear to have existed in any human government &mdash; on the faith of a single line of a dead language, <measure n="3000years" type="date">three thousand years</measure> old, about <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> the meaning of which no <num value="2">two</num> scholars agree?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>That is the whole sentence; <quote>by man</quote> is an interpolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>That is the whole literal interpretation of the words; we have got to make out the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Some say it is a prophecy, <quote>Whosoever taketh the sword, shall perish by the sword;</quote> and so of all the different meanings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>I do not go into them, because it is utterly immaterial to my argument which is the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The simple fact that the most eminent <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> scholars have never been able to agree upon an interpretation, is enough for me. Is it not singular, I say, that so transcendent an act of legislation as <quote>breaking into the bloody house of life,</quote> as <persName n="Shakspeare,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00084.00291" reg="mostcommon:Shakspeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakspeare</surname></persName> writes,--the taking of human life,--should be left to hang on a doubtful sentence, in a dead language, more than <measure n="3000years" type="date">three thousand years</measure> old?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Why, gentlemen, if a doctrine is of importance in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, it is spread over many pages; it shines out in parable; it is put prominently forward in exhortation ; it is given in <num value="1">one</num> way and then in another; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by <num value="1">one</num> writer and then by another,--but here is this single sentence, nothing else; we have got to hang on this; we cannot find it anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Our Saviour says, reiterating the great <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> command, <quote>Thou shalt not kill ;</quote> but here is an exception, according to this theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>Get rid of this sentence, and there is no trouble anywhere else in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>Now, I say, that if that was a command to control all governments, to trample under foot all circumstances, it would be natural to conclude that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would have expressed it more clearly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>But, leaving this point, to whom is this command addressed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Is it to governments?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>No, gentlemen, it is addressed to individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>When <name n="God" type="God">God</name> spoke to <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00085.00292" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>, there was no government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The address was to individuals, and it was so interpreted for more than <measure n="1500years" type="date">fifteen hundred years</measure>. It was addressed to each individual man; and when the <name>Jews</name> were organized into a nation, they found this original command, according to this interpretation, resting on each man, to kill whoever had killed his nearest relative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>You know that all through the <name>Pentateuch</name> you have frequent references to the old right, before government existed, of each man to kill the person who had taken the life of his nearest of kin. This command then is addressed to individuals,--it is a command to the nearest of kin to kill whoever slays his relative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>If this is a command of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it is addressed to you and to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Every pulpit in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> interprets that as a command of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>I believe that it <hi rend="italics">is</hi> a command of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> addressed to individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has never taken it back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>It is addressed to me, then, just as much as to <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00085.00294" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>; there is no time with the <name>Almighty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>You say the jury had acquitted the man; but what are the jury to me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>I know he was guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> command to me is that I should kill him; I have killed him. Take my life if you dare!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>You are disobeying the divine commandment!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Suppose he should say this, how would you meet it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Where could you impeach his argument upon the doctrine maintained here?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>That is a command addressed to every individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>There was no sheriff then; no county courts; no government; no legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>There were but <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> men on the face of the earth, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> promulgated a law. It was addressed to every human being, and it was to be obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>It is universally recognized in the Old Testament in the sense I have stated, and it was exercised in that sense for <measure n="1500years" type="date">fifteen hundred years</measure>. Where is the exception, gentlemen, to that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>If the gentlemen who have appeared before you against the abolition of the death penalty will stand on that statute, so will we. Let us see what sort of a government you will produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>Whenever a man has taken life, the nearest of kin of the murdered person will avenge him, according to his own idea, and government has no right to interfere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/><quote>Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Not <quote>whosoever <hi rend="italics">means</hi> to shed;</quote> not <quote>whosoever <hi rend="italics">maliciously</hi> sheddeth;</quote> <quote>sheddeth with malice aforethought, <hi rend="italics">malice prepense</hi>;</quote> --but <quote><hi rend="italics">whosoever sheddeth</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>Now we make a distinction,--we say the man who kills in hot blood, or unawares, is guilty only of manslaughter; we must have malice aforethought to constitute the crime of murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>We draw the line; in the time of <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00086.00296" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName> it was not drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Is this legislature ready to obey this statute, and annul the distinction between murder and manslaughter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>Is it ready to make it the law of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, that whosoever takes <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> life, no matter how, shall be hanged by the neck until he is dead?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Do not say I am quibbling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>I will show you I am not. Look in the <num value="35" type="ordinal">thirty-fifth</num> of Numbers, and you will observe that <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00087.00297" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> makes a peculiar institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>He sets apart <num value="6">six</num> <quote>cities of refuge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>What are they for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Whoever commits murder with malice prepense, with design, is to be killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Whoever smites a mall unawares, that he die, he has a right to fly into a city of refuge, and stay there a year and a day, or until the death of the <rs>High Priest</rs>; and provided he stays there during that period, the nearest of kin cannot kill him. <quote>These <num value="6">six</num> cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them; that every <num value="1">one</num> that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>(Num. <num value="35">XXXV</num>. <num value="15">15</num>.) That was the only restraint which <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00087.00298" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> dared to put upon the right of the nearest of kin to take the life of anybody who had killed his relative, whether he took it by design or not. The murderer, you will observe, by the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> chapter of Numbers, is to be put to death, whether he gets to the city of refuge or not; but the man who has committed manslaughter is not to be killed, provided he stay in the city of refuge a year and a day. Now, what does that show?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>It shows <num value="2">two</num> things,--in the first place, that, prior to <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00087.00299" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>' making that statute in Numbers, the nearest of kin took the life of anybody who killed his relative; and in the second place, it shows, what I have stated to you, that there is no distinction in this passage between murder and manslaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/><persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00087.00300" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> institutes a distinction, and says that if a man has committed homicide,--has killed a man unawares,--and shall go to a city of refuge, and shall stay in this city a year and a day, he is not to be punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>The <num value="2">two</num> statutes interpret each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>That <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> statute, which makes a limitation on the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct>, <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> shows what the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meant, and shows that <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00088.00301" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> thought that, according to this passage in Genesis, the blood of the murderer (whether the act were committed with malice aforethought or not) should be taken by the nearest of kin of the murdered person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Gentlemen, that is what a lawyer would call an interpretation from contemporaneous practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Here is the practice of <measure n="1500years" type="date">fifteen hundred years</measure> under that statute, and the man who commits murder, with aforethought or unawares, is to be slain by the nearest of kin of the murdered man. If that was the original command, obey it. We have only the statute of Genesis; we have no <num value="35" type="ordinal">thirty-fifth</num> chapter of Numbers, with its limitation,--that was addressed to the <name>Jews</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>We have no <quote>cities of refuge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>A man cannot go to <placeName reg="Worcester, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014647">Worcester</placeName> or <placeName reg="Salem, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014447">Salem</placeName>, and stay there a year, by way of punishment, or atonement for his offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>We have not the exception; we have only the statute.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>Now, gentlemen, are the reverend gentlemen willing to say that you shall annul the distinction between murder and manslaughter in the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName>,--that if a man kills another unintentionally, without malice, he shall be punished with death, under the covenant with <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00088.00302" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>If they will not, what right have they to come here and tell you to obey that statute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>If that is a statute of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, what right have they to make exceptions?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/><persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00088.00303" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName> avoids this dilemma, and how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>He allows that this command was addressed to individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>He allows that it cannot be obeyed by individuals now, --that it would derange all society, upset all government; and what does he say?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>He says, we cannot obey the statute as it was originally given; <hi rend="italics">because there is such an entire change of circumstances since the time of <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00088.00304" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName></hi>. Indeed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>But <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00088.00305" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName> can interpolate <quote>circumstances</quote> into the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and if he can, cannot <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> we?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>If you are going to open a door in the statute for the great procession of circumstances in a period of <measure n="19centuries" type="date">nineteen centuries</measure> to pass through, can you not open it wide enough to carry the gallows out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>If <quote>circumstances</quote> have changed so much since this command was delivered, that it is not safe for an individual to kill the murderer, perhaps they have changed so much that you and I can get rid of the gallows altogether.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Suppose you had made a statute for the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName>; suppose you had passed the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs>, and <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> afterwards the authorities in some town in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> should refuse to execute it, should make exceptions to it, and when they were remonstrated with they should say, <quote>Yes, certainly, those were the circumstances in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, but in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> they have changed, and we are going to change the statute, the legislature would undoubtedly like to have it done,</quote> --what would you think of their reasoning?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>If this is a statute at all, it is a statute until <name n="God" type="God">God</name> alters it. If <num value="1">one</num> man has a right to say that <quote>circumstances</quote> have dispensed with <num value="0.5">one half</num> of it, another individual has a right to say that <quote>circumstances</quote> have dispensed with it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/><persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0010.00089.00306" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, you know, cut out all the parts of the New Testament to which he objected, and said of the remainder, <quote><hi rend="italics">This</hi> is my New Testament.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>There was no objection to it, except that different people might take out different parts, and there would be no New Testament left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Just so with <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00089.00307" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName>. <quote>Circumstances</quote> have not dispensed with the statute, <quote>Thou shalt worship the <rs>Lord</rs> thy <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,</quote> <quote>Thou shalt love thy neighbor;</quote> none of the <num value="10">ten</num> commandments are dispensed with,--how is it that <quote>circumstances</quote> have dispensed with <num value="0.5">one half</num> of this statute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/><pb id="p.90" n="90"/></p> 
<p>In the third place, gentlemen, it is a singular fact, that if this be the law, <quote>Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</quote> it has never been obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>If this be the meaning of the statute, that every civil government that exists is bound to kill every human being who has taken life, it has never been obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>It is a strong argument against that interpretation, that practice has never conformed to it. <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00090.00308" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> took the life of an Egyptian; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> did not order him to be killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>According to this statute, <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00090.00309" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> ought to have been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/><persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> killed <persName><foreName>Uriah</foreName></persName>; <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> was not killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>So you can find in various parts of the Old Testament, accounts of several ancient worthies who took life,--took it, too, in a way that in <orgName n="Modern Society" type="society">modern society</orgName> would subject them to punishment; yet they were not punished, though, according to this statute, they ought to have been put to death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Then look at another point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Did you ever hear of a civil government that did not locate in some portion of its arrangements the pardoning power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>Did you ever hear of a government that did not give either the king, or the legislature, or the governor, or the council, or somebody, the pardoning power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>If a jury shall condemn a man to death, the governor may interpose and save his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Where does he get this power under this statute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> does not say, <quote>Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed, provided the governor does not pardon him,</quote> --that proviso is not there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>If this is a statute of the most high <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, you have got to obey it, obey it literally; and every man who is convicted of homicide is to be punished capitally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>No considerations of mercy, no pity for his family, no consideration of darkness of mind, his want of education, ought to make him a fit subject for pardon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>There is no proviso for pardon in this statute; what right, then, <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> has the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> to exercise such a power on the theory of these gentlemen?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>You perceive the force of my argument, gentlemen of the <rs>Committee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>The upholders of capital punishment say that inside of this book there is a command to keep up the gallows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>We respectfully reply: Take the statute in this book; construe it as you would any other law, and obey it,--and if you will obey it in that way, we are willing the government shall try the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>But we are not willing that anybody should take out as much as he pleases, and leave the rest as binding upon us. If this is a law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, <quote>Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed,</quote> --if that is the whole of it,--you have no right to give <persName n="Gardner,Governor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00091.00310" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName> the pardoning power, because <name n="God" type="God">God</name> does not recognize that power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>There was an old lawyer who used to say that he could make a flaw in any statute large enough to drive a coach through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>How large a flaw must you make in this statute before you can get modern government under it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>If it is a statute, it means all I have said; if it is not a statute, it means nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>You are to choose between <num value="1">one</num> horn of the dilemma or another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>If you want a government based on <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00091.00311" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>, take it; but don't throw it in our faces when we undertake to erect a government on the principles of modern experience, that we are disobeying a divine command in its full letter and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Do not throw it in our faces for a single item, and then refuse to conform to it when it goes against yourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>Then, again, if this verse is a binding statute, all the verses are. Here is the covenant with <persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00091.00312" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>, and this is <num value="1">one</num> of the articles of that covenant, <quote>But flesh, with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>(<rs type="role">Gen.</rs> <num value="9">IX</num>. <num value="4">4</num>.) This has always been interpreted to prescribe a certain <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> method of killing meat to be eaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>Even at this day, the <name>Jews</name> of the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> will not buy meat in the common markets of the city, because they think it transcends that command,--that it is not properly blooded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>They obey that law to the very letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>Did you ever hear of a Christian, who comes here with the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> verse of this chapter written all over him, and maintains that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> commands you to hang,--did you ever know that he made any particular inquiries in the market as to whether he was obeying the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> verse?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>No, gentlemen, he is a Jew as to the gallows; he is a Christian as to his pork.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>But that <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> verse is a more important <num value="1">one</num> than the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num>, after all. If you turn over to that chapter in Acts, where the <name>Apostles</name> give their general directions to Christians, you will see that they reiterate the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> verse: <quote>For it seemed good to the <rs>Holy Ghost</rs>, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things: that ye abstain from meats offered to idols, <hi rend="italics">and from blood, and from things strangled</hi>,</quote> etc. (Acts <num value="15">XV</num>. <num value="28">28</num>, <num value="29">29</num>.) That command of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> verse has been reiterated, but not the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>Suppose an individual should say so,--what should you think of it?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>What results from these considerations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>Why, this results,--that nobody can obey that statute at the present moment, and no civil government does; and the government that should undertake to do it for <num value="1">one</num> hour, would be hurled into oblivion the next, by the aroused indignation of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Constitute yourselves a government; make no distinction between manslaughter and murder; declare that the individual shall have the right to take the life of the person who kills his nearest relative; give the governor no right to pardon,--and see how long such a government would stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>And yet I contend that no man who interprets that statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>by the common rules of evidence and contemporary practice, can find any of the merciful provisions of modern government in it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>He instituted <quote>cities of refuge,</quote> where the individual offender should be safe; but if he left the city, he was liable to be killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>I contend, gentlemen, that in this issue between the parties, it is we who are upholding the Old Testament, not those who defend the gallows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>We say, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> did not mean to prescribe a law for civil government in all time,--that was not his object; or, if he did, this was permissive merely, you <hi rend="italics">may</hi> take life, if you wish to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>This is my proposition, gentlemen: <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00093.00314" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> that to be a statute; if it is a statute, interpret it like any other statute; and when you have done that, then we will say <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> these gentlemen are sincere and consistent, if they sup. port and obey it. But until they do, we are not willing to have them interpolate as much as they choose into it, and then require us to obey it. If you will show me a man who rigidly obeys the other verses of the covenant, then I will show you a man who really supports the gallows because he thinks the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> verse commands it; but until you do, I shall think the opponents of the abolition of the death penalty are influenced by other motives than those which appear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>Now, gentlemen, I shall leave this subject in a moment; but allow me to say to you, that this statute is represented as a warrant from Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, commanding all governments, for all time, to inflict the penalty of death upon every man who takes life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>There is only this single verse, in language of an uncertain tenor, and it has all the difficulties about it I have named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>I ask you, in all sincerity, if any county sheriff would hang <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> man on a writ as ambiguous as that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>You know he would not; and yet governments are to hang to all time, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> are to die, upon the authority of a statute so uncertain in its meaning that no sheriff would hang an individual man on a precept so equivocal, and so much surrounded with difficulties!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>If society can get <hi rend="italics">permission</hi> to take life from this text, it is the most that it can <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> get; it is no command, no continuing command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>Your Constitution does not even recognize it as a <hi rend="italics">permission</hi>; because, if it is, it is a per. mission to commit suicide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>You must argue down the <rs>American</rs> idea of government before you can put down the argument which forbids the taking of human life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>There is great difficulty here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>This is not the republican theory of government, gentlemen; but I have no quarrel with it,--it may be so. But you sit here under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and if that Constitution is right, you have got no powers except what the people give you. When, gentlemen, did the law recognize that I have the right to take my own life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Never. Then, under your idea of compact, you have no right to take my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>If your Constitution is a sound, logical instrument, the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> statute that hung a man on the gallows was a violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>; for it undertook to assume over that man's life a power which he did not himself possess, and which he could not, therefore, delegate to the <rs>State</rs>; and the <rs>Constitution</rs> says that the government could have no right except what that man gave it,--<quote>The body politic is formed by a voluntary association of individuals; <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> it is a social compact by which the whole people covenants with each citizen, and each citizen with the whole people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>Now, will any man undertake to show me how any government founded upon that as its cornerstone can claim the right to take life, unless the individual has a right to take his own life,--unless suicide be justifiable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>The defenders of the gallows all feel the necessity of meeting this objection, and they uniformly do it by rejecting the idea of compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>They claim that government is something else,--that you get your rights somewhere else than from a compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>They ignore it entirely, and they have a right to, for they are only writing books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>But you cannot; for you are sitting here as a legislature, and must respect the <rs>Constitution</rs> you have sworn to support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>Let us look at another argument of <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00096.00317" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>He says society gets the right to take life as the individual gets the right of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>What is the principle of the law.? The principle of the law is this: If a man is going to take your life, you have no right to take his immediately; you must retreat to the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>The rule of the common law says: You must retreat until you can retreat no farther; and then, when you must either die or kill him, you may kill him; but if you kill him at once, without retreating as far as you can, you are guilty of manslaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Now, if <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00096.00318" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName> is going to get the right from this principle just alluded to, then society is bound to show, not that taking life is a good thing, but that it is an absolutely <hi rend="italics">necessary</hi> thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>Society is bound to show that, in conformity with this rule, she has retreated to the wall,--that is, done everything she could before taking the life of the murderer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>Society has got <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> to show, if <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00097.00319" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName>'s theory is correct, that, like the individual, before she raised her hand, she retreated as far as she could,--she ran and hid herself, got out of the way, and when she could do nothing else, then she took the life of the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>But now, how is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>Who are the men that are hung?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>Are they the rich, the educated, the men that are cared for by society?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>No, that is not the class that supplies the harvest for the gallows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>The harvest of the gallows is reaped from the poor, the ignorant, the friendless,--the men who, in the touching language of <persName n="Lamb,,Charles,,," id="n0189.0010.00097.00320" reg="default:Lamb,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>, <quote>are never brought up, but <hi rend="italics">dragged</hi> up;</quote> who never knew what it was to have a mother, to have education, moral restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>They have been left on the highways, vicious, drunken, neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>Society cast them off. She never extended over them a single gentle care; but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time this crop of human passion, the growth of which she never checked, manifests itself,--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that ill-regulated being puts forth his hand to do an act of violence, society puts forth her hand to his throat, and strangles him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>Has society done her duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Could the intelligence, the moral sense, and the religion of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> go up and stand by the side of that poor unfortunate negro who was the last man executed in this Commonwealth, and say that they had done their duty by him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>He had passed his life in scenes of vice; he had never known what it was to have a human being speak to him in a tone of sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Had society done her duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Had she retreated to the wall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>He never landed in our city but the harpies of licentiousness and drink beset him, and the churches never rose up in their majesty to forbid it. Steeped to the lips in vice for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, when society found him guilty of an act of violence, the natural result of such a life, did society take him and say, <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave this man to me an innocent <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> soul, and I have let him grow up into this monster, and now I will take him and restrain him; I will throw around him moral influences, and see if I cannot make a human being of him?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Did society retreat to the wall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Did she try to save that man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>No; she inflicted on him the severest punishment,--she took away his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/><quote>Society is an instrument of good,</quote> said <num value="1">one</num> of your members a few days ago. Then she is bound to educate the man thrown into her hands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>This is a very broad theory, that society gets the right to hang, as the individual gets the right to defend himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Suppose she does; there are certain principles which limit this right, to which she is bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Besides, when society has got the man completely in her power, what is she to do with him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>Suppose a man attacks me to-day; according to <persName n="Cheever,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00098.00321" reg="mostcommon:Cheever,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName>, I have the right to take his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>But the law says: <quote>No; if you can restrain him, you must do so, and not kill him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Society has got the murderer within <num value="4">four</num> walls; he never can do any more harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>You can put him in a jail from whence he can never escape; where he can never see the face of his kind again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>Has society any need to take that man's life to protect herself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>Has she retreated to the wall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>If society has only the right that the individual has, she has no right to inflict the penalty of death, because she can effectually restrain the individual from ever again committing his offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Suppose a man should attempt to kill me in the street, and I should take his life, and when I was brought before <persName n="Shaw,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0189.0010.00098.00322" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Lemuel,,,"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, and asked how I killed him, I should say: <quote>I overcame him; I threw him on the sidewalk; I bound him hand and foot; and then I killed him,</quote> --would that be justifiable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>No, I should be imprisoned for manslaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>Society takes the murderer; she shuts him up in jail; she keeps him <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, or longer; she tries him before <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> <num value="12">twelve</num> men; and then, having him utterly, irremediably in her power, she hangs him; and then she turns round and tells you, <quote>I have only the right of the individual;</quote> and the common law retorts upon her: <quote>You had no right to take that man's life; you might have restrained him, if you would, and you had no right to kill him.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>As I said at the beginning, there are <num value="2">two</num> objects of penalty,--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to restrain the offender from repeating his offence; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to deter other people from imitating it. Now, if the object be simply to prevent the individual from repeating the offence, he cannot repeat it if he is shut up in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>You can keep him there; you can deny to the governor the power to pardon such persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>You can declare, as <persName n="O'Sullivan,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00099.00323" reg="mostcommon:O'Sullivan,nomatch:0"><surname>O'Sullivan</surname></persName> proposes, that such persons shall not be pardoned except by the <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote of <num value="3">three</num> successive legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>You can keep them in prison, if you choose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Nobody can say that a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men and women, with <num value="1">one</num> poor, hapless man in chains, are so afraid of him that they are obliged to take his life in order to prevent the offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>No, gentlemen, nobody pretends it. The only claim now is, that it is necessary, in order to prevent other men from repeating it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>Here is another point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>If this idea of hanging men, for example, is correct, then why do you not make your executions as public as possible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>Why do you not hang men at the centre of the <name>Common</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>Our fathers did it. They hung their people under the great tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>They hung them for example, and of course they wished everybody to see it. They hung men upon the <name>Neck</name>, and crowds went out to see it. If example is the object, the sight of punishment would seem to be essential to its full effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>Why, <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0189.0010.00099.00324" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> tells us, <measure n="2000years" type="date">two thousand years</measure> ago, that a thing seen has double the weight of a thing heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/><pb id="p.100" n="100"/> Everybody knows that a child will recollect what he sees <num value="10">ten</num> times as well as what he hears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>You know that in old times (not to make a laugh of it), in <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, they used to take the children to the line of the town, and there give them a whipping, in order that they might remember the bounds of their township by that spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Now, there are <num value="14">fourteen</num> States in the <rs>Union</rs> that have made executions private, and in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> they are private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Only a few men &mdash; some <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num>--are allowed to witness them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>Mark you, the whole claim of the value of executions now lies in their example; yet it is found that out of <num value="167">one hundred and sixty-seven</num> persons executed in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> within a certain limit of time, <hi rend="italics"><num value="164">one hundred and sixty-four</num></hi> had witnessed executions!

In consequence of these executions, a sort of mania for killing arises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>You know how it has been in other cases,--what a mania there was at <num value="1">one</num> time for shooting <persName n="Phillippe,,Louis,,," id="n0189.0010.00100.00326" reg="default:Phillippe,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Phillippe</surname></persName>, and at another for intruding on <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Victoria</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>It takes possession of people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>Society has learned that to witness executions develops a certain instinct for blood which is dangerous; and so, in many countries, the government does not permit it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>There is another singular thing about this punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>Here is an ordinance of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, of the sublimest authority in the universe (according to the upholders of capital punishment), commanding us to execute our fellow-men; and yet, in all civilized society, <persName n="Chairman,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0010.00100.00327" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chairman</surname></persName>, the man who executes that law &mdash; the hangmanis not esteemed fit for decent society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, the man who has hung another runs out of the city in disgrace, and if he were to appear again, the mob would tear him <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> in pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>To call a man a hangman is the greatest insult you can cast upon him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/><persName n="Beecher,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0010.00101.00328" reg="nearbymention:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName> (<hi rend="italics">interrupting</hi>).--I suppose that is because he has touched sin and been polluted.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>[This retort excited great merriment, the audience loudly applauding.]</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Then here is another very important fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>That statute--<num value="1">one</num> line of which, according to these gentlemen, has sufficient vitality to cover all space and time &mdash; is so horrid you cannot permit the world to look at it. It demoralizes society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>The reason given for hiding the gallows was, that its influence was demoralizing; it was found to be the universal testimony that executions were great promoters of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>The <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> police never had so much to do as when there was an execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>If example is the object, why certainly the example of the actual thing at the moment ought to have prevented people from committing the same offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>Yet you remember the very remarkable case of the widow of a forger in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, who begged her husband's body of the executioner and took it home; and the police, suspecting the parties, entered the house and found forged notes concealed in the very mouth of the corpse!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>The wife and the other parties were engaged in the same crime, and to conceal it, put into the mouth of the corpse the evidence of their guilt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>And such cases are not at all uncommon, though this <num value="1">one</num> may be most remarkable in its circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>This was the reason why executions were made private.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>I appeal to you, and to every member of the profession familiar with criminal law, whether the idea of deterring others from committing offences by punishing the offender severely, is not found, in practice, to be utterly unsound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Brougham</foreName></persName> goes on to say: <quote>It may be that I am Quixotic, but if government has no other way of protecting society against the repetition of offences except by punishing the offender severely, then government is a failure. ... In my opinion,</quote> he adds, <quote>the only protection government has is this: Take possession of the offender, and subject him to moral restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>Make your jail a moral hospital; make the man over again, if you can,--and in that way you protect society from that man henceforth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>Take the rest of the community and educate them, and in that way you protect society from them, and in no other.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>I am not quoting a morbid philanthropist or a mere sentimentalist, but a cool, hard lawyer, who, after many years of practice and ample opportunities for observation, comes to the conclusion that the gallows, and penal legislation of all kinds, if it has no other object than the example of punishment, is a failure, and that there is no remedy but education.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>There is, therefore, gentlemen, no reason, either on the ground of keeping the offender from repeating his <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> offence, or in the influence of the example, for the gallows; there is no necessity for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>It is proved by <name>English</name> history that just so fast as you take the death-penalty from a crime, the crime diminishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>Experience is all that way, and not the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>I hold that you cannot oblige us to show that taking away the gallows is better than to keep it. It is acknowledged that as regards the prevention of crime the gallows is a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>You do not prevent crime by hanging the criminal,--it increases.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/></p> 
<p>Whether the punishment of death should be abolished in any of the few cases to which it is now applied [the capital penalty of robbery and burglary had been done away with in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>] has often been a subject of legislative inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>It does not belong to me to enter upon an argument that is nearly exhausted; but I deem it within my province in this connection respectfully to submit to the legislature that, in the present state of society, it is no longer an abstract question, whether capital punishment is right, but whether it be practicable; and that there is good reason to believe that punishment for crime would more certainly follow its commission if the legislature should further abrogate the penalty of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>As the law now stands in this respect, its efficiency is mostly in its threatenings; but the terror of a trial is diminishing, and the culprit finds his impunity in the severity which it denounces.</p></quote> <pb id="p.104" n="104"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>Now, gentlemen, if you cannot execute a law, it is manifest that it better not be on the statute-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>This is just what they found in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>For instance, the law used to be that a man should be hung for stealing a shilling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>That was thought too hard, and the sum was raised to <measure n="40s." type="currency"><num value="40">forty</num> shillings</measure>; but under this law, no jury could be found to convict,--they would find some way to evade the statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>Thus, in <num value="1">one</num> case, a man was taken up for stealing a watch which cost <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure>. The man had undoubtedly stolen it; it was proved against him. The jury brought him in guilty of stealing the watch, and found that the watch was worth <measure n="39s. 11d." type="Currency"><num value="39">thirty-nine</num> shillings, <num value="11">eleven</num> pence</measure>. The watch-maker said, <quote>Why, the very fashion of that watch was worth <measure n="5l." type="pounds"><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/><quote>Perhaps it was,</quote> said the jury, <quote>but we don't hang a man for <measure n="5l." type="pounds"><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>Afterwards they raised the amount to <measure n="5l." type="pounds"><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure>; then the jury brought the accused in guilty of stealing <measure n="4l. 19s. 11d." type="Currency"><num value="4">four</num> pounds, <num value="19">nineteen</num> shillings, <num value="11">eleven</num> pence</measure>,--always keeping <num value="1">one</num> penny behind the hanging limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>Of course it was perjury, but the jury would not convict of the crimes of stealing and forgery, when the penalty was death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>The legislature said, The man who forges shall be hung,--but men forged every day, and every hour of the day; and the bankers of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, with <num value="1000000">millions</num> of pounds resting on the fidelity of an autograph, went before the legislature and said, <quote>Be kind enough to pass a statute against forgery that shall not inflict the punishment of death.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>It was found that a man charged with forgery was certain to be acquitted; the witnesses quibbled, the juries quibbled, the prosecuting officer quibbled, until no man was ever hung for forgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>Then the bankers of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> (<num value="1000">one thousand</num> of them) went before the legislature, and said, <quote>Your gallows is no protection to us; be kind enough to take it away!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/><pb id="p.105" n="105"/></p> 
<p>Gentlemen, for <measure n="100years" type="date">one hundred years</measure>, the progress of all legislation has been to throw away these extreme penalties; and in proportion as it has done so, crime has diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>That shows that society does not need the gallows for protection; and if it does not need it for protection, it has no right to it. These gentlemen will not contend, of course, that society has a right to take life from caprice, from whim, from taste, but only from necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>If we show you that when it has been withdrawn from a crime, that crime has diminished, then,--I say, we show you a competent and sufficient argument why it should be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>We have got outside of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> now; we have got the experience of <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, that every crime from which the penalty of the gallows was taken off has diminished; we have got the experience of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,7009760" n="1.000 8" reg="toscana">Tuscany</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>, of <persName n="Mackintosh,Sir,James,,," id="n0189.0010.00105.00335" reg="default:Mackintosh,James,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Mackintosh</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, where they have given up the death penalty, yet murder did not increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>You say, these experiments were local, and for a short time; true, but they were all <num value="1">one</num> way. Society has never tried the gallows but to fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>Now, all we ask of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> is, that when she has tried the <num value="1">one</num> and not succeeded, she shall now try the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>We used to punish highway robbery with death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>Then that crime was frequent; but things got to such a state that, as <persName n="Rantoul,,Robert,,," id="n0189.0010.00105.00336" reg="default:Rantoul,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Rantoul</surname></persName> said, a man was more likely to be struck by lightning, sitting in his parlor in any town of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, than to be hung for highway robbery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>We took off the penalty of death, and then highway robbery diminished; there were more cases before than since.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>In the <name>States</name> that have abolished the death penalty, the result has been entirely satisfactory; and every humane man must rejoice at it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>We are in a better condition to try such an experiment than <placeName reg="Michigan, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>, far better than <placeName reg="Belgie" key="tgn,1000063">Belgium</placeName>, <placeName reg="Toscana" key="tgn,7009760">Tuscany</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>; yet they tried it and were successful, and why will not we try it also?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>And yet you will not for an hour think of receiving it as a whole, and obeying it as a whole; you would be the shame of Christendom if you attempted to obey it If it is not a statute to be obeyed wholly, then it is nothing.

Then, gentlemen, as to the necessity of it. The whole current of legislation is to give it up. We have given it up in almost all cases, and we are safer than we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>No State that has abolished it has ever taken a backward step voluntarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>What is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>Why, it would be idle to say that there woman is man's equal; she is his superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>In social life she has taken the lead; she dictates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>Hers is this realm, and from her judgment there is no appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>Her intellect summoned literature into being, almost; as a reader she has demanded that it shall be decent; and now she takes her pen as a writer, and controls the world, as the sceptre of genius always controls it, no matter what lips, male or female, <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> living coal has touched.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>That, I say, is the counterpart, the picture, that represents to us what law and the civil state are to undergo in their successive changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>We are here to-day only to endeavor to enforce on the consideration of the civil state those elements of power which have already made a social state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>You do not find it necessary to-day to say to a husband: <quote>Your wife has a right to read;</quote> or necessary to say to <persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n0189.0011.00111.00345" reg="mostcommon:Dickens,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName>, <quote>You have as many women over your pages as men.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>You do not find it necessary to say to the male members of a church that the women members have a right to change their creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>All that is settled; nobody contests it. If a man stood up here and said, <quote>I am a Calvinist, and therefore my wife is bound to be <num value="1">one</num>,</quote> --you would send him to a lunatic asylum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>You would say, <quote>Poor man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>don't judge him by what he says; he does n't mean it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>But law is halting back just where that old civilization was; we want to change it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>We are not doing anything new. There is no fanaticism <pb id="p.112" n="112"/> about it. We are merely extending the area of liberty,--nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>We have made great progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>The law passed in your State at the last session of the legislature grants, in fact, the whole question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>The moment you grant us anything, we have gained the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>You cannot stop with an inconsistent statute-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>A man is uneasy who is inconsistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>As old <persName n="Fuller,,,,," id="n0189.0011.00112.00346" reg="mostcommon:Fuller,nomatch:0"><surname>Fuller</surname></persName> says, <quote>You cannot make <num value="1">one</num> side of the face laugh, and the other cry!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>You have granted that women may be hung, therefore you must grant that women may vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>You have granted that she may be taxed; therefore, on republican principles, you must grant that she ought to have a voice in fixing the laws of taxation,--and this is, in fact, all that we claim &mdash; the whole of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>Now I want to consider some of the objections that are made to this claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>Men say: <quote>Woman is not fit to vote; she does not know enough; she has not sense enough to vote.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>I take this idea of the ballot as the <name>Gibraltar</name> of our claim for this reason, because I am speaking in a democracy; I am speaking under republican institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>The rule of despotism is that <num value="1">one</num> class is made to protect the other; that the rich, the noble, the educated, are a sort of <placeName reg="Probate Court">Probate Court</placeName>, to take care of the poor, the ignorant, and the common classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>Our fathers got rid of all that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>They knocked it in the head by the simple principle that no class is safe, unless government is so arranged that each class has in its own hands the means of protecting itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>That is the idea of republics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>The <rs>Briton</rs> says to the poor man: <quote>Be content!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>I am worth <num value="5000000">five millions</num> and I will protect you;</quote> America says: <quote>Thank you, sir; I had rather take care of myself!</quote> --and that is the essence <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> of democracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>[Applause.] It is the corner-stone of progress also, because, the moment you have admitted that poor, ignorant heart as an element of the government, able to mould your institutions, those <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of dollars feel that their cradle is not safe and their life is in peril, unless that heart is bulwarked with education and informed with morality; selfishness dictates that wealth and education should do its utmost to educate poverty and hold up weakness,--and that is the philosophy of democratic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>[Applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>I am speaking in a republic which admits the principle that the poor are not to be protected by the rich, but to have the means of protecting themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>So, too, with the ignorant; so, too, with races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>The <rs>Irish</rs> are not to trust to the sense of justice in the <rs>Saxon</rs>; the <name>German</name> is not to trust to the native-born citizen; the <rs>Catholic</rs> is not to trust to the <name>Protestant</name>: but all sects, all classes, are to hold in their own hands the sceptre &mdash; the <rs>American</rs> sceptre &mdash; of the ballot, which protects each class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>We claim it, therefore, for woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>The reply is that woman has not sense enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>If she has not, so much the more shame for your public schools,--educate her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>If <name n="God" type="God">God</name> did not give her mind enough, then you are brutes; for you say to her <quote><rs type="role2">Madam</rs>, you have sense enough to earn your own living,--don't come to us!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>You make her earn her own bread, and if she has sense enough to do that, she has enough to say whether <persName n="Wood,,Fernando,,," id="n0189.0011.00113.00348" reg="default:Wood,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> or <persName n="Morgan,Governor,,,," id="n0189.0011.00113.00349" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> shall take <num value="1">one</num> cent out of every <num value="100">hundred</num> to pay for fire-works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>When you hold her up in both hands and say: <quote>Let me work for you!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>Don't move <num value="1">one</num> of your dainty fingers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>We will pour wealth into your lap, and be ye clothed in satin and velvet, all ye daughters of Eve!</quote> --then you will be consistent in saying that woman has not sense enough to vote; but if she has sense enough to work, to depend <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> for her bread on her work, she has sense enough to vote.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>Then, again, men say, <quote>She is so different from man that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> did not mean she should vote.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>Is she?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>Then I do not know how to vote for her. [Applause.] <num value="1">One</num> of <num value="2">two</num> things is true: She is either exactly like man,--<hi rend="italics">exactly</hi> like him, <hi rend="italics">teetotally</hi> like him,--and if she is, then a ballot-box based upon brains belongs to her as well as him; or she is different, and then I do not know how to vote for her. If she is like me, so much like me, that I know just as well how to vote for her as she knows how to vote for herself, then,--the very basis of the ballot-box being capacity,--she, being the same as I, has the same right to vote; and if she is so different that she has a different range of avocations and powers and capacities, then it is necessary she should go into the legislature, and with her own voice say what she wants, and write her wishes into statute-books, because nobody is able to interpret her. Choose which horn of the dilemma you please, for on the <num value="1">one</num> or the other, the question of the right of woman to vote must hang.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>It is exactly the question of races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>You might as well say that the <name>Irishman</name> is not like the <rs>Saxon</rs>; that the <name>Hindoo</name> is not like the <name>Englishman</name>,--the world admits that they are not. Races are different; therefore, the <name>German</name> may well say, <quote>You are a Yankee, with a soul curbed in a sixpence; you are not capable of voting for me. Your whole past and present are different from mine, and when I come to be an element in your civilization, I must shoot up my peaks into the highest land of legislative and civil life, because I want to be represented there as well as you.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>I do not think woman is identical with man. I think if she was, marriage would be a very stupid state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> made the races and sexes the complement <num value="1">one</num> of the <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> other, and not the identical copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>I think the world, and literature itself, would be barren and insipid, if it was not for this exquisite variety of capacities and endowments with which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has variegated the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>I think woman is different from man, and by reason of that very difference, she should be in legislative halls, and everywhere else, in order to protect herself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>But men say it would be very indelicate for woman to go to the ballot-box or sit in the legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>Well, what would she see there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>Why, she would see men. [Laughter.] She sees men now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>You may get into an omnibus,--women are there, crowding us out sometimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>[Laughter.] You cannot go into a theatre without being crowded to death by <num value="2">two</num> women to <num value="1">one</num> man. If you go to the <name>Lyceum</name>, woman is there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>I have stood on this very platform, and seen as many women as men before me, and <num value="1">one</num> time, at least, when they could not have met any worse men at the ballotbox than they met in this hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>[Laughter and applause.] You may go to church, and you will find her facing men of all classes,--ignorant and wise, saints and sinners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>I do not know anywhere that woman is not.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>It is too late now to say that she cannot go to the <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> ballot-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>Go back to <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, and shut her up in a harem; go back to <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, and shut her up in the private apartments of women; go back to the old <placeName reg="Oriental, Paraguay, South America" key="tgn,7002637">Oriental</placeName> phases of civilization, that never allowed woman's eyes to light a man's pathway, unless he owned her, and you are consistent; but you see, we have broken down that bulwark centuries ago. You know they used to let a man be hung in public, and said that it was for the sake of the example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>They got ashamed of it, and banished the gallows to the jail-yard, and allowed only <num value="12">twelve</num> men to witness an execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>It is too late to say that you hang men for the example, because the example you are ashamed to have public cannot be a wholesome example.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>So it is with this question of woman; you have granted so much, that you have left yourself no ground to stand on.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>Woman will meet at the ballot-box the same men she sees in the lecture-room, the church, the theatre, the railroad cars, and the public streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Long used <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> to respect woman's presence in those places, the vast majority of men obey there the laws of decency and good manners; and no husband or father thinks it necessary to prohibit entirely his wife or daughter's entrance to a theatre, church, car, or street, because some rare individual may chance to insult or offend her. Indeed, I may go further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>The bully who knocks your hat over your eyes at the polling-booth would turn you out of his own house if you uttered a word disrespectful to his wife, mother, or daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>He knows what is due to woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>Let woman go to the ballot-box, and the rudest man will in time be ashamed not to carry there his good manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>The keenest insult you can offer even to a rowdy,--the <num value="1">one</num> he will resent the quickest,--is to hint that he does not know what is due to woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>In his own parlor he puts on his decency, and claims it of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>I will extend that parlor until it includes the polling-booth, when I give to both alike the restraining influence of the presence of woman.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>All we ask is, that our civilization shall be made complete and consistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>We base our civilization on ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>We say that representation and taxation go hand in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>We say that <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName>, no matter though his gifts be godlike, is entitled to no more ballots than the <name>Irishman</name> who pays <measure n="9s." type="currency"><num value="9">nine</num> shillings'</measure> poll-tax, and can just write his own name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>We do not base our institutions on mental discipline, on culture; we base them on enough brains to be responsible to penal statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>The man who is not enough of an idiot to be excused from the gallows, has sanity enough to be entitled to vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>That is the principle of Republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>Now, I claim, and always shall claim, that as long as woman has brains enough to be hung, she has brains enough to go to the ballot-box; and not until you strike her name off the tax-list, and excuse her from penal legislation, will <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> you, be justified in keeping her name off the list of voters:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>Ladies and gentlemen: I am very glad that all that will be required of me this morning, is to answer to the roll-call,--to say <quote>Yes</quote> to my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>You know you cannot have more than the whole of a subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>That is not possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>I have only had the pleasure of listening to the last address, by our friend <persName n="Beecher,,Henry,Ward,," id="n0189.0012.00128.00370" reg="default:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Ward</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName>; and I think if he had left a suggestion unmade, or any part of the field unexplored, I would have made an effort to supply the omission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>But as I watched him step by step, it seemed to me that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0189.0012.00128.00371" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> could not have covered his camp and his lines more effectually, from centre to outpost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/><persName n="Holmes,,Oliver,Wendell,," id="n0189.0012.00128.00372" reg="default:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName> said once that there was always a representative man who went out of every lecture-room at a certain period, at all seasons of the year, and in all parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>The lyceum lecturers held a consultation to learn the cause, and <persName n="Holmes,,,,," id="n0189.0012.00128.00373" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,Oliver,Wendell,,"><surname>Holmes</surname></persName>, being a surgeon, performed an autopsy, and found that the reason was that the man's brain was full; and when he came to that state, he went out. I think you must all have come to that state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>There is no speech left for us who follow to make; but I hope you will allow me a single suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/><pb id="p.129" n="129"/></p> 
<p>I think our friend touched the very kernel of the whole subject when he reminded you that suffrage was not alone woman's right, but woman's duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>I believe that to confer the ballot will add but little to the influence of woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>I am interested in this question, because I wish to put recognized power where there already exists unrecognized influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>I think unrecognized influence is always dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>It acts under no adequate sense of responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>Society does not attempt to check it. It is unheeded and unwatched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>Consequently it is always doubly liable to corruption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>I believe that to-day it may be said, more truly than of any other cause in our social philosophy, that woman rules the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>What made the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>Woman did not make it; but without the enthusiasm and the frenzy of women on its side, it never could have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>What was the potent influence that almost tore the <rs>Republic</rs> asunder?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>Woman's. Yet that wide-spread, deep-anchored force had swayed the <rs>Southern</rs> mind for years,--under no sense of civil responsibility, neither watched nor educated, never in the eye of day, never feeling that it was doing anything which needed to be summoned before the tribunal of conscience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>Our friend said that if woman could vote, she would shut up the groggeries of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>She could shut them up to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/><placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> is nothing compared with fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>What is the legislature compared with the <hi rend="italics">ton</hi> that permeates society,--the throne that woman <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> founded, and has ever since filled?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>More than college, stronger than church, weightier than trade, more controlling than all put together, woman is its recognized queen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>If she issued her edict to-day, unfaltering, unmixed, undoubting, there could nought but submission follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>A vote is a great thing; legislation is a large power,--but money is a larger power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>Why do not women make <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>They have the faculty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>The brother comes into this city; no man knows his name; his purse is empty; his word would not be worth <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure>, and his opinion less; he lives here a dozen years, walks up and down <address><street n="Wall Street">Wall Street</street></address>, and finally his name counts for <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>Why was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>He clutched at all the opportunities which society gave him; he made himself a force; he garnered around himself the influences of life and business connections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>Why should not woman?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/><placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> does not hinder her. There is nothing on the statute-book to forbid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/><num value="1">One</num> large, ugly, irreconcilable fact of a woman worth <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> by her own toil, would be worth quartos of statute-books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>Why does she not make it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>Because you do not let her; because it is reputable for a boy to go and make money, and it is not reputable for his sister; because fashion says to the girl that earns her own bread, <quote>You are tabooed;</quote> while fashion says to the boy that does not earn his own bread, <quote>You are a poppinjay.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>The consequence is that <num value="1">one</num> earns his own bread, and his place in the world's panorama besides; the other lacks it. Where is the remedy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>You cannot be legislated into it. Nothing can help you up at <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>No ballot-box will help you, except indirectly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>Issue your edict.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>The medical profession is full of prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>The men that gain them occupy a large space before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>Why does not woman obtain some of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>Why does she not clutch the largest culture and discipline, and gain the greatest prizes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>If every woman said, <quote>When I need, in extremest peril, the aid of science, I will take it only at a sister's hand,</quote> do you suppose there is a college in the broad <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that would dare to shut the doors of its opportunities against a woman?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>Not for an hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>I want to urge it upon your attention that large as is <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> the ballot, broad as legislation is, behind it are broader opportunities and a larger influence; and the only thing that blocks the door to those paths is your opinion,--an opinion that you can change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>The edict of woman's decisive opinion will close the groggeries of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York City</orgName> much quicker than the <orgName n="Metropolitan Police" type="government">metropolitan police</orgName> can close them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The singularity of this cause is that it has to be argued against the wishes and purposes of its victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>The slave stood behind us, the irresistible pulsations of his heart agonizing for his rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>The unrepresented <num value="1000000">millions</num> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> swell the voice of John Bright; and as our friend told us, Aristocracy trembles before their half-uttered wish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>But when you come to the <rs>Woman Question</rs>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great abiding difficulty is that woman is herself the obstacle,--that she fills the chair most potent and irresistible in this discussion, that of popular opinion, and she utters her verdict against us. I would not belittle the ballot, nor fail to appreciate legislation; but I would remind woman that legislation is but a circumstance in the broad circle of the forces that make and mould civil power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>Business, professional distinction in society, education,--these are as much the elemental creators of our civilization as the lawbook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>Indeed, the law-book is nothing but the vane on the steeple, and these are the winds that set its direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>So when we find fault with the prejudices of this class or that, against conferring the ballot, it is to be remembered that after all, in the largest and most emphatic sense, it is woman herself who is against us. Sometimes they say, <quote>That is very true; but do you expect us to initiate an opinion on this subject while man remains unconvinced?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>That argument acknowledges your inferiority.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>The course of the world's history is, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the government <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> of force; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, brute strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>An old Hindoo dreamed that he saw the human race led out to its varied fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>And <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, he saw men bitted and curbed; and the reins were of iron, and went back to an iron hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>And he dreamed on, the legend says, until he saw men led by invisible threads that came from the brain and went back to an unseen hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the government of force; the last was the government of ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>In this government of ideas, in the struggle upward, we have something more noble than selfish interests or party averages to govern the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>Woman's brain, if our cause rests on a sound and enduring basis, is to be as prompt and influential in establishing the future as man's. There have been but <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> times in the history of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> when fashion in the <hi rend="italics">salons</hi> of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> would not have unseated any king; yet woman never had a vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>When <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0189.0012.00132.00374" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> banished <persName n="Stail,Madame,,,,de" id="n0189.0012.00132.00375" reg="mostcommon:Stail,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Stail</surname></persName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, he acknowledged the power of the throne she filled, and that his could not withstand her influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>If the genius of <persName n="Stael,Madame,,,,de" id="n0189.0012.00132.00376" reg="mostcommon:Stael,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Madame">Madame</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Stael</surname></persName> is the representative to any extent of the force that woman can wield in <orgName n="Modern Society" type="society">modern society</orgName>, then this cause rests upon you <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and almost last upon fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>A sneer at woman's making her living, a lack of recognition because she earns her bread, just that flavor of unfashionableness which work stamps upon woman,--in that impalpable, almost invisible, indescribable power, is the magic that binds <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> in the chains of male legislation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>The legislator votes from the streets of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>You may as well attempt to whisper back <persName n="Niagara,,,,," id="n0189.0012.00132.00377" reg="mostcommon:Niagara,nomatch:0"><surname>Niagara</surname></persName> as to change this by legislation; yet there are forces that can change it. The very force that gave it food can give it poison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>The sister comes to New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The prizes of life are before her, and her brother wins <pb id="p.133" n="133"/> them,--large wages, ample opportunities, breadth for development, every career open,--he takes them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>He smothers the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stimulus to vice, and cultivates ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>If he fails once or twice he gets up again, and having driven out of the chamber the <name>Devil</name>, he fills it with honorable aspirations, with ambition to be worthy of his father, and to do something for the world into which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has sent him. The sister comes into the city, and she finds starvation wages,--wages at such a rate that they offer no rise even in the future to what her soul aspires to. Vice comes with gilded hand, clad in velvet, attended with luxury, in the chariot of ease, and says, <quote>An hour, and all this is yours.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>Give men honest wages, and <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> out of a <num value="100">hundred</num> will disdain to steal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>Give woman what the same labor gives to man, and <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> out of <num value="100">one hundred</num> will disdain to purchase it by vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>[Applause.] But you will never fill up that grave until you enable women to stand before the competition of the crowded streets of this city and make their choice as men do,--not crowded by your religious bigotry, born of a mistaken and ideal <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">Saint Paul</placeName>, or a fastidiousness which will not allow women to work into a few occupations, but with every door open to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>Let the <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> women that must earn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>a living have a choice of <num value="500">five hundred</num> occupations, and dictate terms, instead of standing trembling at the doors, and taking work at <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> the price of male labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>Then you cure vice because you withhold the food upon which it lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>Legislation cannot do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>You cannot legislate the tailor into high wages, when a <num value="1000">thousand</num> needle-girls stand at his door begging for the work of which he has only enough to fill the hands of a <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>The Sermon on the <name>Mount</name>, put into the statute-book, would not change it <num value="0.5">a half</num>-cent; but if fashion, respectability, and the public opinion of a kind sisterhood <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> will say to those <num value="1000">thousands</num> of girls: <quote>It shall be as honorable to you, no matter where you earn your bread, as it is to your brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>We trample mistaken Judaism under <num value="1">one</num> foot, and our absurdly ideal <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">Saint Paul</placeName> under the other; nothing to us is the old, false, so-called delicacy, which was the <name>Moloch</name> to which religious bigotry and mistaken opinion offered up the virtue of <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the sisterhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>In spite of all, go out; earn your living in some <num value="200">two hundred</num> or <num value="500">five hundred</num> vocations.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>Then, at his door, the tailor will find <num value="50">fifty</num> women when he wants a <num value="100">hundred</num>, and they will dictate terms from the outside, instead of he from within.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/><placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> cannot help you. Political economy cannot help you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>Gild her pathway with your approbation, no matter where she walks in honest business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>[Applause.] Greet her with the most honorable recognition, no matter what she does, provided it be what her brother might do,--an honorable man under the same circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>That immedicable wound of a great city, that social vice before which modern civilization stands aghast, unable even to suggest a remedy, will lie helpless and conquered in the hands of a correct public opinion, that shall allow woman to make her way upward to ease, to honor, to wealth, to all that the human soul craves, unchecked by morbid fashion; and it is you that make public opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>The tempter to vice in the streets of New York is not the <hi rend="italics">rout</hi>; it is the absurdly fastidious, the bigotedly religious sister that lives in a warm mansion within half a mile.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>We have adequate illustration of the effect that I am prophesying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>Take literature, for instance, to which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>allusion has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>Woman is an equal in the literary republic; genius knows no sex. Men count women as readers,--even more of women than of busy men. What is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>The literature of the <rs>Middle Ages</rs>, that was not readable, that had to be expurgated, is lifted to a higher level; its tone is broader, and its perception finer; it is the diapason of the instrument before which the classicism of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rome, Oneida, New York" key="tgn,7014359">Rome</placeName> was heavy and dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>Woman's influence is felt in literature, and what is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>As much as the average level of the race will permit, literature is the proof that there are some dark lines to be added.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>Potent and equal in this, as woman has been, there is much yet to be cured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>Give woman the ballot, and I do not count on the millennium the next day. No; it will come very gradually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>In the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, woman has had a recognition, but not an equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>Christianity has given her much more than the law did. She has a large representation there, and to some extent a vote; but her authority is anchored <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> behind the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century in spite of it. It did not save the <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> Church; it will not save the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>The <rs type="place">Church cut</rs> short her power, and limited her influence much more than literature has done; and her marvellous effect is better seen in the literary republic than in the religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>Both show the almost immeasurable and inexpressible potency of the presence of this element of public opinion mingling with ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>But the largest symbol of what woman can do, is her own exclusive sphere, and that is fashion,--in society, omnipotent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>I do not blame men when I meet them full of prejudice against this movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>I do not feel by any means that keen agony of interest in this question that I did in the <rs>Slavery Question</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 51" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>, we owe <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps toward the recognition of woman's right to property to the selfishness of fathers, about to leave their daughters dowered with large wealth, and unwilling to trust it to the chances of their husbands' character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>They were always anxious to put it into the hands of trustees, and they found that men were very much averse, even when bidden by the strongest friendship, to undertake a long trust on account of its dangers and responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>The fathers themselves selected the most conservative lawyer at the <rs>Suffolk</rs> bar to draw the statute, than which we could not have imagined a better, which secured to wealthy women the control of their inherited property, even if they were married.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>Again, it was the bank interest of the <orgName n="Savings Bank" type="bank">savings-bank</orgName> <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, that secured to laboring women their wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>These causes co-operated before the public opinion of women themselves demanded the changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Laggard, and lacking her promptings, the cause that we advocate came up behind the selfish elements of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>But if, instead of this, the working women or heiresses had dictated their wants, the changes could have been made; and so they can to-day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>I do not ignore the power of woman; it is too great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>I want it lessened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>I am not going to give the sex any more influence; I am going to diminish it. Her influence is hidden and all but omnipotent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>Uneducated and irresponsible, it is terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>I want it dragged to the light of day; I want it measured and labelled; I want it counted and criticised; I want it educated and put on record; I want to be able to find it and indict it, which I cannot do to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>In order to do that, let us trace home the evil to its very source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>Let woman know that nobody stops her but herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>She ties her own limbs; she corrupts her own sisters; she demoralizes civilization,--and then folds her arms, and calls it <quote>religion</quote> [applause], or steps back, and christens it <quote>taste.</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>The labor of these <measure n="29years" type="date">twenty-nine years</measure> has been in behalf of a race bought and sold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>The South did not rest their system wholly on this claim to own their laborers; but according to <persName n="Harper,Chancellor,,,," id="n0189.0013.00139.00380" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chancellor">Chancellor</roleName> <surname>Harper</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stevens,,Alexander,H.,," id="n0189.0013.00139.00381" reg="default:Stevens,Alexander,H.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pickens,Governor,,,," id="n0189.0013.00139.00382" reg="mostcommon:Pickens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Pickens</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Calhoun,,John,C.,," id="n0189.0013.00139.00383" reg="default:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, asserted that the laborer must necessarily be owned by capitalists or individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>That struggle for the ownership of labor is now somewhat near its end; and we fitly commence a struggle to define and to arrange the true relations of capital and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>To-day <num value="1">one</num> of your sons is born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>He lies in his cradle as the child of a man without means, with a little education, and with less leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>The favored child of the capitalist is borne up by every circumstance, as on the eagle's wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>The problem of to-day is how to make the chances of the <num value="2">two</num> as equal as possible; and before this movement stops, every child born in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> must have an equal chance in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/><pb id="p.140" n="140"/></p> 
<p>In this final arrangement, every man will combine in his own person the laborer and the capitalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>There cannot be any conflict between labor and capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>What makes our lives easier than those of our ancestors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>They are so because <num value="6">six</num> generations of workmen have made <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> a great treasure-house of capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>When our fathers landed here, <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> was a wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>Forests have been removed, roads built, cities raised by capital or aggregated labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>Capital and labor are only the <num value="2">two</num> arms of a pair of scissors,--useless when separate, and only when fastened together cutting everything before them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>What, then, do we come here for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>To find out the true relation between capital and labor, to make the laborer more comfortable, and a more worthy citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>Where the government rests on the people, its administrators are bound to give time to the laborers to understand the theory of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>When shut up an excessive number of hours in labor, the workman comes out but the fag-end of a man, without brain to think of such subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>Now, therefore, it is a fair division to give him <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> for labor, <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> for sleep, and <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> for his own,--his own to use as he pleases.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>The present effort is to give the laborer more leisure, <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> in order to make him more intelligent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>You need not despair if truth is on your side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>You must have the truth, and must work for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>Opinions differ not from scoundrelism or want of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>You want to make the intellect of the <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> country discuss the question, to make every man speak of it. How did we Antislavery men do this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>How will you make the newspapers and the public men discuss the <rs>Labor Question</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>I will tell you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>What will be the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>It will be the same as in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, when the <name>Abolitionists</name> said they were going to trample on the <rs>Whig</rs> and Democratic parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>The journals then took up the question; the intellect and education of the country took hold of it, and settled it by balking the <rs>South</rs> so that they said, <quote>Make or ruin, we will go outside.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>How will you make your enemies wield the pen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Do it by announcing your political creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>Break into the debating society at the statehouse, and make them discuss the <rs>Labor Question</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>I don't want the subject made political in a bad sense of the word, but in a higher sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>When men have wrongs to complain of, they should go to the ballot-box and right them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>I may be asked if I would give universal suffrage to ignorant men, and thus give them power over the property of the millionaire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>I answer, Yes; all the more for that, because then the millionaire would be willing to give a part of his wealth to aid in making voters intelligent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Universal suffrage is taking a bond of the rich to educate the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>You will never reach the <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> influential classes by meetings like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>How will you do it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>Go to your next candidate for mayor, and ask him if he is in favor of the <num value="8">eight</num>-hour system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>If he says, Yes, let it be known that he is to have your votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>If No, let him know that he will not have them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>You will not, perhaps, gain the victory the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>It would be a disgrace if you did. [A voice, <quote>Why?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>The <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Advertiser</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Transcript</hi> will discuss it, and the <rs>State</rs> will be lifted by the <num value="4">four</num> corners.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>Some may think this a political address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>Let every oppressed man come; let every poor man come; let every man who wishes to change his residence come,--we welcome all; frankly acknowledging the principle that every human being has the right to choose his residence just where he pleases on the planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>Our faith in our political institutions and in our social system is that both can endure all the strain which such immigration will produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>More than this, we believe that our civilization will be perfected only by gathering into itself the patient toil, the content with moderate wages, the cunning hand, the inventive brain, the taste and aspirations, the deep religious sentiment, the rollicking humor and vivid imagination, the profound insight and far-reaching sagacity which mark the different races; each contributing <num value="1">one</num> special trait to the great whole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>But such immigration to be safe and helpful must be spontaneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>It must be the result of individual will obeying the laws of industry and the tendencies of the age. <hi rend="italics">Immigration of labor is an unmixed good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>Importation of human freight is an unmitigated evil</hi>. <pb id="p.146" n="146"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>This brings us to the question of importing <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>The <rs>Chinese</rs> are a painstaking, industrious, thrifty, inventive, self-respectful, and law-abiding race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>They have some pretentions to democratic institutions and moral culture,--are a little too much machines; but we shall soon shake that servility out of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>Their coming will be a welcome and valuable addition to the mosaic of our nationality; but, in order to that, they must come spontaneously, of their own free-will and motion, as the <name>Irish</name>, Germans, and English have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>If the capital of the country sets to work, by system and wide co-operation, to import them in masses, to disgorge them upon us with unnatural rapidity,--then their coming will be a peril to our political system, and a disastrous check to our social progress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>We lay it down as a fundamental principle,--never to be lost sight of,--that every immigrant of every race must be admitted to citizenship, if he asks for it. The right to be naturalized must not be limited by race, creed, or birthplace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>Secondly, every adult here, native or naturalized, must vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>In spite of this, give us time, with only a natural amount of immigration, and we can trust the education and numbers of our native voters to safely absorb and make over the foreign element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/><name>Irish</name> and <name>German</name> immigration has been only a ripple on our ocean's breadth; generally speaking, it has been only a healthy stir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>But it is easily possible for associated capital to hurry the coming of the <name>Chinese</name> in such masses as will enable these money lords to control the ballot-box by their bond-servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>An extended <placeName key="tgn,7014234" n="1.000 6" reg="north adams, berkshire, massachusetts">North Adams</placeName> can do more than lessen shoemakers' wages; <num value="1000">one thousand</num> such Samsons, the associated capital of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, can swamp and overwhelm the ballot-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>We hold it to be clearly within the province, and at clearly the duty of legislation, to avert this <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>Capital is too strong now. The public welfare demands that its political power be crippled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>Universal suffrage is admissible only on condition of an educated people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>We cannot undertake to educate the whole world at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>In detachments, <num value="1000000">million</num> by <num value="1000000">million</num>, we can digest the whole human race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>Then as to the influence of such importation on the laboring classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>The <rs>Chinaman</rs> will make shoes for <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure> a day. The average wages for such work in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> is <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure>. What will become of the native working-men under such competition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>He met similar competition from the <name>Irish</name> immigrants and the <name>German</name>; but it never harmed him. They came in such natural and moderate numbers as to be easily absorbed, without producing any ill-effect on wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>These continued steadily to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>So will it be in the case of the <name>Chinese</name>, if he be left to come naturally by his individual motion; imported in overwhelming masses by the concerted action of capital, he will crush the labor of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> down to a pauper level, for many years to come.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>Putting aside all theories, every lover of progress must see, with profound regret, the introduction here of any element which will lessen wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>I have only gone into this statement to approach a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> point; and that is, we stand on the moment when the people actually put their hands forth for power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>We stand at an epoch when the nature of the government is undergoing a fundamental change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>I have been speaking of machines,--whether we should operate through a Senate and <rs type="role2">President</rs>, or solely through a House.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>I have been speaking of the spindles and wheels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>Below that lies the water-power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>The water-power of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been the wealth of <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> landholders,--<num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> land-holding families, perhaps <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> or a <num value="1000000">million</num> voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>With us, the water-power is to be the ballots of <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of adult men and women, scattered through all classes,--rich and poor, educated and ignorant, prompt and conservative, radical and timid, all modes and kinds and qualities of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Well, that brings me to the form which this great advance of the people takes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>It is the working masses that are really about to put their hands to the work of governing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>It is no accident, no caprice of an individual, no mere shout of the political arena, that heralds to-day the great Labor movement of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>But in the mean time, over the horizon, looming at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and now almost touching its meridian, comes up another power,--I mean the power of wealth, the inordinate power of capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>Our fathers, when they prevented entail, when they provided for the distribution of estates, thought they had erected a bulwark against the money power that had killed <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>They forgot that money could combine; that a moneyed corporation was like the papacy,--a succession of persons <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> to do over again what the <rs>Whig</rs> aristocracy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has successfully done for <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>. <num value="30000">Thirty thousand</num> families own <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to-day; and if you multiply John Bright by a <num value="100">hundred</num>, and double his eloquence, it seems impossible that he should save <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> from a violent convulsion in the great grapple between such a power and the people who have determined to have their way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>Men blame us, the representatives of the workingmen of the nation, that we come into politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>The other day it was my good fortune to meet that distinguished Frenchman, <persName n="Coquerel,Monsieur,,,," id="n0189.0015.00158.00401" reg="mostcommon:Coquerel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Monsieur">Monsieur</roleName> <surname>Coquerel</surname></persName>; and he asked me what was the motto of the working-men of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>Now, here I take issue with the best critic which the <name>Labor</name> movement has met: I refer to <persName n="Johnson,Reverend,Samuel,,," id="n0189.0015.00158.00402" reg="default:Johnson,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Salem, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014447">Salem</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the thinkers who has spread out before the people his objections to the <name>Labor</name> movement of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objection is, that we will hurry into politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>Well, now, our answer to him, and to the score of other scholars who have been criticising us, is this: Gentlemen, we see the benefit of going into politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>If we had not rushed into politics, had not taken <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> by the <num value="4">four</num> corners and shaken her, you never would have written your criticisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>We rush into politics because politics is the safety-valve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>We could discuss as well as you, if you would only give us bread and houses, fair pay and leisure, and opportunities to travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>We could sit and discuss the question for the next <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. It's a very easy thing to discuss, for a gentleman in his study, with no anxiety about to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>There they sat, balancing and discussing sweetly, making out new theories, and daily erecting a splendid architecture of debate, till the angry crowd broke open the doors, and ended the discussion in blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>They waited too long, discussed about half a century too long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>You see, discussion is very good when a man has bread to eat, and his children all portioned off, and his daughters married, and his house furnished and paid for, and his will made; but discussion is very bad when-<quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>I ask the critics of the <name>Labor</name> movement, whether any man ever misunderstood this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Every man who reads of the <rs>Labor Question</rs> knows that it means the movement of the men that earn their living with their hands; that are employed, and paid in wages; are gathered under roofs of factories; sent out on farms; sent out on ships; gathered on the walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>In popular acceptation, the working class means the men that work with their hand's, for wages, so many hours a day, employed by great capitalists; that work for everybody else.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>Because, while <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName> gets <measure n="40000dollars" type="currency">forty thousand dollars</measure> for arguing the <rs>Mexican</rs> claims, there is no need of anybody's moving for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>The reason why the <name>Labor</name> movement confines itself to a single class is because that class of work does not get paid, does not get protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Mental labor is adequately paid, and more than adequately protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>It can shift its channels; it can vary according to the supply and demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>If a man fails as a minister, why, he becomes a railway-conductor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>If that does n't suit him, he turns out, and becomes the agent of an insurance office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>If that does n't suit, he goes West, and becomes governor of a Territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>And if he finds himself incapable of either of these positions, he comes home, and gets to be a city editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>He varies his occupation as he pleases, and does n't need protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>But the great mass, chained to a trade, doomed to be ground up in the mill of supply and demand, that work so many hours a day, and must run in the great ruts of business,--they are the men whose inadequate protection, whose unfair share of the general product claims a movement in their behalf.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>Again, gentlemen, we have another doubt to express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>Are you quite certain that capital &mdash; the child of artificial laws, the product of society, the mere growth cf social life &mdash; has a right to only an equal burden with labor, the living spring?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>We doubt it so much that we think we have invented a way to defeat <persName n="Scott,,Tom,,," id="n0189.0015.00166.00429" reg="default:Scott,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, of <pb id="p.167" n="167"/> the <rs>Pennsylvania Central</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2000"/>When we get into power, there is <num value="1">one</num> thing we mean to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>Gentlemen, I feel honored by this welcome of your organization, and especially so when I consider that the marvellously rapid success of the political strength of the <name>Labor</name> movement, especially in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, is due mainly to this organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>There never has been a party formed that in <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> has attracted toward itself such profound attention throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>Some of you may be old enough to remember that when the <name>Antislavery</name> sentiment, nearly <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, endeavored to rally a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, it took them some <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> before they had an organization that could be considered national in any real sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>The political Labor movement in <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> has reached a position of influence which it took that idea <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> to obtain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>I trace that rapid progress in popular recognition to the existence of these <persName n="Crispin,,,,," id="n0189.0016.00168.00432" reg="mostcommon:Crispin,nomatch:0"><surname>Crispin</surname></persName> lodges and trades-unions of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>You cannot marshal <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men at once, taken promiscuously from parties and sects; they must be trained to work together, they must be disciplined in co-operation; and it is the training and the discipline which the working-men got in these organizations that enabled the <name>Labor</name> movement to assume its proportions so rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/><pb id="p.169" n="169"/></p> 
<p>Then, again, I stand here with great interest from another consideration,--I stand in the presence of a momentous power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>I do not care exactly what your idea is as to how you will work, whether you will work in this channel or in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>I am told that you represent from <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> to <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men, here and elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>Think of it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>A <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>They can dictate the fate of this nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>Give me <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men in earnest, who can agree on all vital questions, who will plant their shoulders together, and swear by all that is true and just that for the long years they will put their great idea before the country, and those <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men will govern the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>So if I have <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> men represented before me, who are in earnest, who get hold of the great question of labor, and having hold of it, grapple with it, and rip it and tear it open, and invest it with light, gathering the facts, piercing the brains about them and crowding those brains with the facts,--then I know, sure as fate, though I may not live to see it, that <hi rend="italics">they will certainly conquer this nation in <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure></hi>. It is impossible that they should not. And that is your power, gentlemen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>I rejoice at every effort working-men make to organize; I do not care on what basis they do it. Men sometimes say to me, <quote>Are you an Internationalist?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/>I say, <quote>I do not know what an Internationalist is;</quote> but they tell me it is a system by which the working-men from <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Europe, " key="tgn,7005233">Gibraltar</placeName>, from <placeName reg="Moscow, Fayette, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100492">Moscow</placeName> to <placeName reg="Paris, Henry, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100914">Paris</placeName>, can clasp hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/>Now, let me tell you where the great weakness of an association of working-men is. It is that it cannot wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/>It does not know where it is to get its food for next week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/>If it is kept idle for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, the funds of the <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> society are exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>Capital can fold its arms, and wait <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>; it can wait a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>It will be poorer, but it does not get to the bottom of the purse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>It can afford to wait; it can tire you out, and starve you out. And what is there against that immense preponderance of power on the part of capital?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>Simply organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/><hi rend="italics">That makes the wealth of all, the wealth of every <num value="1">one</num></hi>. So I welcome organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>I do not care whether it calls itself Trades-union, <persName n="Crispin,,,,," id="n0189.0016.00170.00433" reg="mostcommon:Crispin,nomatch:0"><surname>Crispin</surname></persName>, International, or Commune; anything that masses up the units in order that they may put in a united force to face the organization of capital, anything that does that, I say <hi rend="italics">amen</hi> to it. <num value="100000">One hundred thousand</num> men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>It is an immense army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>I do not care whether it considers chiefly the industrial or the political questions; it can control the nation if it is in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>The reason why the <name>Abolitionists</name> brought the nation down to fighting their battle is that they were really in earnest, knew what they wanted, and were determined to have it. Therefore they got it. The leading statesmen and orators of the day said they would never urge abolition; but a determined man in a printing-office said that they should, and they did it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>And so it is with this question exactly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>Brains govern this country; and I hope to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the time will never come when brains won't govern it, for they ought to. And the way in which you can compel the brains to listen and to attend to you on the question of labor, actually to concentrate the intellectual power of the nation upon it, is by gathering together by hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, no matter whether it be on an industrial basis or a political basis, and saying to the nation, <quote>We are the numbers, and we will be heard,</quote> and you may be sure that you will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>Now, an Englishman has but <num value="1">one</num> method to pursue, to be heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>He puts his arm up among the cog-wheels of the industrial machine, and stops it. That <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> is a strike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>That is good, but we have a quicker way than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>Intemperance is the cause of poverty, I know; but there is another side to that,--poverty is the cause of intemperance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>These men were all men of education and leisure; they had books and paintings, opera, race-course, and regatta.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>What is the explanation of such a fact as that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/>Why, the club-man had a circle of pleasures and of company; the operative, after he had worked <measure n="14hours" type="date">fourteen hours</measure>, had nothing to look forward to but his grog.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>That is why I say, lift a man, give him life, let him work <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure> a day, give him the school, develop his taste for music, give him a garden, give him beautiful things to see, and good books to read, and you will starve out those lower appetites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>So it is with women in prostitution.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>Gentlemen of the committee: The question you have to consider at this time grows out of the question of Temperance,--the interference with the sale, the public sale, of intoxicating drinks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>It is not a new question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>What we call the <name>Temperance</name> cause in this Commonwealth is half a century old; and on the other side of the water, if you analyze strictly the legislation of the old countries, the attempt to limit and prohibit, to a certain extent, in the cause of public protection, the free use and sale of intoxicating liquor, is many centuries old. The new point in the discussion is, that any man should assume that a government trespasses on the rights of individuals when it attempts, at last, to legislate on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>I think I may safely say, that there is no statute-book in the world, no matter how old its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> page is,--no statute-book since the discovery of alcohol,--which has not in it a law in regard to this subject; and if you go behind the <orgName n="Christian Era" type="newspaper">Christian era</orgName>, and into the legislation of the older countries, the same attempt is visible, I think, there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>We are not, therefore, trying to gain or clutch any new ground; we are only <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> examining the method by which an old and constantly acknowledged power shall be used.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>Again, some men say the <name>Temperance</name> cause is a very narrow, petty, sentimental enterprise, fit for half-witted men, weak-minded women, theorists, but utterly repudiated by the manly and practical intellect and commonsense of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>On the contrary, to my mind, the <name>Temperance</name> cause is <num value="1">one</num> of the weightiest, broadest, most momentous, that a citizen, under democratic institutions, can contemplate,--especially under democratic institutions here, and leading a race like ours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>Every race, every blood, every climate, has its own special temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>The tropics have <num value="1">one</num>, the colder climates have another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>Some races are distinguished from others by peculiar temptation and weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>Our climate, our blood, is peculiarly open to the necessity of material stimulus, something that shall wake up and hurry the currents of the blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/>The old idea of heaven, to the fathers of our race, was a drunken revel, overflowing with mead and every intoxicating drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>The race craves these stimulants naturally, and still more incidentally,--from the fast life, from the incessant activity, from the hurried and excited nature which modern life gives us,--from some special need of the body itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>That is our temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>Again, science, in modern times, has elaborated the processes of manufacturing intoxicating liquor to such a cheap and lavish extent, that a man with <num value="1">one</num> hour's work may be drunk a day; with <num value="0.5">one-half</num> day's toil may spread his drunkenness over a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>And yet, with this blood, and with science holding out this temptation, and wages holding out these means, and the heavy working of republican institutions resting on the basis of the people themselves, with no breakwater of bayonet or of despotism,--the sense, virtue, purpose of the masses, the pedestal upon which <pb id="p.180" n="180"/> the great, heavy machine of government must be built, --with these yawning gulfs on each side our national progress, there are men who set their faces against the <name>Temperance</name> agitation, and bid us beware of taking up too much time with the narrow and petty interest which we assume to champion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>A drunken people were never the safe depositaries of the power of self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>Hurried on, the mere victims of demagogues, uncontrollable passion their temptation and their guide, who can safely trust his future and the institutions secured by such toil and such blood, to a race making or groping its way amid such evils and such weakness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>I contend that every man who desires the security of democratic institutions is to see to it, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, that every possible means be exhausted to secure, so far as human means can, a sober people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>To my mind, that is the significance of the <name>Temperance</name> enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>I know its other phases, alluded to by my friend, <persName n="Miner,Reverend,A.,A.,," id="n0189.0017.00180.00441" reg="default:Miner,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Miner</surname></persName>, who has just stood here,--the domestic desolation, the individual ruin, the spiritual wreck, the pecuniary loss, the family destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>I know all that; and to the right mind, there lies the real strength of the <name>Temperance</name> agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>But if any man is of too low a level, too sordid a logic to appreciate or acknowledge that argument, at least citizenship and patriotism, at least selfishness may be brought, for <num value="1">one</num> moment, to reflect, when the very ground around him rests secure only so long as the statute-book is upborne, and the rights of life and property secured by a sober people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>The. question which we meet to discuss to-night is <num value="1">one</num> of this nature,--whether this great principle is to have a fair trial?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>Mark me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>That is my text,--<hi rend="italics">Whether this great principle is to have in the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName> a fair trial</hi>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>The question to be asked in regard to such law is, whether the public opinion of the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName> demands it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>If that opinion does, then <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> has <num value="1">one</num> duty, and but <num value="1">one</num>,--<hi rend="italics">to obey it</hi>. Is there anything undemocratic in that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>Is there any breach of municipal or individual liberty in that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>Has <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> seceded from <placeName reg="Berkshire, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049407">Berkshire</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>I contend that <persName n="Boston,,,,," id="n0189.0017.00181.00442" reg="mostcommon:Boston,nomatch:0"><surname>Boston</surname></persName> is a part of the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName> and bound to obey her law.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>That is not sentiment, that is a fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>If you doubt it, go to the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>'s office</orgName> and get a certified copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>That is an indisputable fact, that the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName> has deliberately chosen this method of carrying out her Temperance purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>Does any man say it is not a good method?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>My friend, that is not admissible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>We have floated beyond that level of argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>The liquor dealers say it is not a good method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>You are out of order!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2169"/>When it was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enacted, the liquor dealers of the <rs>State</rs> did not like it. They went to the legislature, but the legislature stood unmoved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/>Let us stop, and take an inventory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2174"/>We have a law on <pb id="p.182" n="182"/> the statute-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>We have a reiterated decision of the legislature, that that is their sober, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2178"/>The various elements that go to make up the <rs>State</rs> are to obey it, are they not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2179"/>Here is our claim; if you do not like it, go back into the arena, and agitate against it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2180"/>There is where we demand that the liquor interest shall meet us,--in the convention, in the lecture-room, anywhere,--to agitate against the law. We are ready to meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2181"/>We went through <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of such agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>Do let us try this <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. Is that an unfair demand?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2187"/>From the method in which gentlemen address us, <num value="1">one</num> would suppose that there never was a State that tried licensing; that it was a new thought, just struck out from some happy intellect, elevated by a glass of champagne [laughter and applause]; whereas license is as old as <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/>The Commonwealth began with it, and they came up to the year <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>; and every philanthropist, every lover of his country and his city, was pale and aghast at the gigantic strides which this vice was making,--at the tremendous yawning gulf in which all public virtue seemed about to be swallowed up. Pulpit, forum, legislatures counting-house,--every walk of <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> life, public and private, was rotten to the very core.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2189"/>Now, therefore, what we have gained is a law reiterated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2190"/>We have got the court and the legislature on our side; what further do we ask?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>Well, in tie various counties of the <rs>State</rs>, more or less direct and honest effort has been made to carry out the law. We do not stop to say how honest or how direct; that is not our business tonight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>Our business is with the fact, that in this city no effort has ever been made to carry it out; and in saying that I am not throwing any particular blame on any individual officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>Tie mayor and the aldermen are as good as the average; our police agents and subordinates are not open to exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2194"/>It is not the machine, it is the creator of the machine with whom we quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>It is not the police nor the mayor, but it is the elements that make both.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>The reasons why no effort has been made, are plain enough on the very surface of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>They were alluded to by my friend, <persName n="Miner,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0017.00183.00443" reg="nearbymention:Miner,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>Every man familiar with the machinery of democratic institutions knows that <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men, with <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of dollars behind them, commanding from <num value="3000">three</num> to <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> votes, as they readily may, can hold the balance in any election, and make it beyond question that no candidate can ever be ventured by either party, who is not pledged, publicly or privately, not to execute this law of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>Every man knows that that power, thus massed up, can control the municipal government of the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>But we are not now finding fault with this state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>We only <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> say that in consequence of that, or of something else, the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> says to us by the voice of her attorneys, her aldermen, her mayor, <quote>We cannot execute your law.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>We take her at her word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>Year after year she comes to the legislature and says, <quote>We cannot execute your law.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>Well, there are <num value="2">two</num> paths open,--<num value="1">one</num> path is, Repeal the law; the other path is, Try somebody else to execute it. Suppose the engineer of the <placeName key="tgn,7013763" n="1.000 19" reg="fitchburg, worcester county, massachusetts">Fitchburg</placeName> road should report to the directors, <quote>I can't run your engine beyond <placeName reg="Groton, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049856">Groton</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/><num value="2">Two</num> courses would be open for the directors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/><num value="1">One</num> would be to take up the rails west of <placeName reg="Groton, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049856">Groton</placeName>, the other to get a new engineer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>Which do you suppose they would adopt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>[Applause.] The city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> says to the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>,--a Commonwealth that after <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of discussion, after <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure> of patient experiment, announces a new plan, a plan successful to a marvellous extent elsewhere,--the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> says, <quote>We cannot execute your law.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>We take her at her word, and we proceed to do,--what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>Why, to go back to the armory of democratic weapons to find whether democracy has any other means of carrying out a law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>Now, mark you, what is a city?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>It is a body of inhabitants selected from the rest of the <rs>State</rs>, which assembles together and goes to the legislature and says, <quote><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0189.0017.00184.00444" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> us a city government.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>Why do they want it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>They say, <quote>We have large masses of criminal inhabitants, large, massed &mdash; up quantities of wealth; we need a more stringent machinery than a country town.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>The State says, <quote>Yes; take that city charter, and with it take certain conditions and privileges and rights peculiar to a city.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>Now, the tendency of the last <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> has been to what you may call no government,--that is, toward making the government light as possible; filing down all its powers, restricting all its old despotic qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/><pb id="p.185" n="185"/> That is the tendency of our day. You see it everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>We give to wards, to towns, and to small districts unlimited control of their own affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>In the well-educated, sparsely-populated, comparatively poor districts of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, it succeeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>Education and virtue supply the place of force and compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>We have tried the-same policy with the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>We have given to it the exclusive execution of the <rs>State</rs> laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>It was not so <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago; the city was then a town in the county of <placeName reg="Suffolk, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,1002923">Suffolk</placeName>; the <rs>State</rs> sent its own sheriff and its own deputy sheriffs, appointed by itself, not by vote, to execute its laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>You know the city has <num value="2">two</num> codes,--its own by-laws, and also the laws of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>Its own by-laws were always executed by itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>Half a century ago, the <rs>State</rs> laws were executed by State officials.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>We have gradually tended toward giving to the city the whole control of the <rs>State</rs> laws also; and to-day (a fact, probably, of which not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="10">ten</num> in this audience is aware), the police of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> are engaged <num value="3">three</num> quarters of their time, and more, in the execution, not of city laws, but of State laws, of laws which, half a century ago, would have largely been in the hands of the sheriff and his deputies, appointed by the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>We have gone thus far.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>Now, like all other grants, the <rs>State</rs> may resume this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>The reason why she should resume it is, because the city goes to the state-house, year by year, and says: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/></p> 
<p> We cannot execute your laws.</p></quote> If you incorporate a company to build a railroad, after the assigned time, if the road is not finished, the <rs>State</rs> resumes the franchise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>The State granted to the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> the right to execute her laws; they are not executed, and the city proclaims, by the lips of her own officers, that she cannot execute them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>Therefore, the <name>Temperance</name> <pb id="p.186" n="186"/> men, who have funded <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of work in that statute, and who claim of the community this, that, at least, the plan shall have a trial,--as I said at the beginning, a trial, and nothing more,--ask that some other means be substituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>Suppose this plan is tried <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, and fails; we will give it up. Suppose you try it, and it does not work even the miracles that we hope; we will surrender it. But long argument, patient debate, constant experiment, have lifted it into the statute-book, and now, certainly, we may rightfully claim, that the <rs>State</rs> shall provide the machinery to try it before it is taken off that statute-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>Is there anything hard, anything unfair, anything undemocratic in that claim?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>But the city says, <quote>You cannot execute a law that has not public opinion behind it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>Granted, I have no wish to execute a law that has not public opinion behind it. I have no wish to execute a law that has not a preponderating public opinion behind it. But the opinion of what public?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>Is it the opinion of the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>Is it the opinion of the grog-shops of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>Is it the opinion of <address><street n="Beacon Street">Beacon Street</street></address> and the clubs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>Is it the opinion of <address><street n="Ann Street">Ann Street</street></address> and <address><street n="North Street">North Street</street></address>? Is it the opinion of the criminals in the dock?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>No; the law rests on the public opinion of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; and if the liquor interests of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> wish to appear before that tribunal, we are ready, always ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>We welcome them to that great debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>All we claim is, that* when they are beaten in that court, they shall submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>[Applause.] Is that too much to ask?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>If they conquer us, we will submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>But we have not been at boys' play for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>. We have converted the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; it has accepted this idea, and made it into a statute; and if there be a law in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, we mean it shall have a fair trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>[Applause.] <pb id="p.187" n="187"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>How is it to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>We have a court; we have a legislature; what we want is an executive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>Now, friends, before I begin to speak on that point, let me say <num value="1">one</num> thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>If the <orgName n="Metropolitan Police" type="government">metropolitan police</orgName> does not succeed, we shall ask something more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>You need not think you will get rid of us with that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>This is our solemn conviction of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>We have converted the public opinion of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; we mean now to exhaust <name>Yankee</name> ingenuity in the invention of machinery to execute the law; and when Universal Yankeedom confesses that it is bankrupt, we will give up, and not till then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>[Applause.] If the <orgName n="Metropolitan Police" type="government">metropolitan police</orgName> is not enough, then we will devise something stronger and better, before we sit down and say that the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName>, in <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName> assembled, does not rule this Commonwealth, but that the liquor dealers of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> do,--for that is the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>The question is, where is the law to be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>In the gilded saloons of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, or in the state-house on yonder hill?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>If the <num value="1000000">million</num> of people who inhabit this Commonwealth make the law, this is law, and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> has no right to complain &mdash; having abdicated by her own confession &mdash; that we go now to the <rs>State</rs>, and claim other and better machinery to carry it out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/><num value="1">One</num> other point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>You must not expect that this law will convert the whole Commonwealth in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>Look at the history of all law. The time was, <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8centuries" type="date">eight centuries</measure> ago, when it was a disputed point whether a man owned a separate lot of land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>That was settled by public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>Then remained a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> question; whether, owning it at his death, he could bequeath it. Public opinion nibbled at that question for a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, and then settled it. Doubtless, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> statute-book to that extent was enrolled among the parchments, many men relucted; but it <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> gradually settled down from the food into the blood, from the blood into the bones, from the bones into the character of the <rs>Saxon</rs> race; and to-day, every drop of Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0189.0017.00188.00445" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> blood acknowledges the sacredness of property derived from a <num value="100">hundred</num> ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>Law, once placed on the statute-book, educates the moral sense of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>Many a man has no higher level than the statute-book; what is legal he respects; if he trespasses against it, he feels himself a sinner; what is illegal he shrinks from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>Now, this law, if you leave it on the statute-book, is to be the most powerful moral suasion that was ever employed to the conviction of the universal conscience of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>Leave it there a century, let it rest on the public opinion of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, and a man will walk these streets as much ashamed of being descended from an illegal liquor dealer as from an African slave-trader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>[Applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>To-day you regard that statement as fanaticism; but you forget, that the masses of mankind may get their ethics, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, from the statute-book, and only secondly from the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>; so that, if you will only let this statute stand, we shall have, not merely public opinion, but public virtue, to sanction it, all over the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>But you say to me, it is a single statute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>It is not this single statute alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The liquor dealers of the city of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> <hi rend="italics">permit &mdash; that</hi> is the proper word &mdash; the execution of the <rs>State</rs> laws only so far as they do not interfere with their interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>Take the <name>Sunday</name> law. If there be anything anchored in the very superstition as well as in the religious principles of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, it is the sacredness of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> day; and yet that law, <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> old,--perhaps the most largely supported by public opinion of anything this side the law of murder,--is not executed on this peninsula, and never will be when <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> it comes in contact with the interests of the liquor dealers of the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>You talk to me about this statute not being capable of execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>There is no statute capable of execution which comes athwart the selfishness of the liquor trade of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>Gambling is illegal; the brothel is illegal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>They could neither of them be sustained without that substratum and corner-stone, the <num value="1950">nineteen hundred and fifty</num> open places for the sale of intoxicating drinks; and do you suppose that either of those laws, held superstitiously, conventionally, religiously sacred as they are in the heart of every <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> man, is executed, or can be executed to-day, when the liquor dealers of this city to a certain extent cover these places with the shelter of their common interest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>No; I am not standing here to-night to plead merely that the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs> cannot be executed; I am saying that <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of dollars, standing behind what are in fact the criminal classes of the city (and I use the word <quote>criminal</quote> in its broad, legal sense,--everything which evades the laws, bylaws, State laws, all laws),--I say <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of dollars, <num value="2000">two thousand</num> places for the sale of drink, standing behind the criminal classes, sustaining them, massing them together by the attraction of a common interest, always have, always will, always must, control the municipal government of the peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>If you want any law executed faithfully, efficiently, it must be done by the old democratic authority,--the sovereignty of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>Why does the city ask for peculiar privileges for her police?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>You meet a policeman in the street, and he has powers over you a <num value="100">hundred</num> fold greater than the constable of a country town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>Why does the city want it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>Because she acknowledges that the government wages an unequal war with the criminal classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>Remember, that in <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, <num value="45">forty-five</num> men out of every <num value="100">hundred</num> on this peninsula are arrested for crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/><num value="45">Forty-five</num> men <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> out of every <num value="100">hundred</num>,--nearly <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the population of the peninsula, in <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> pass through the station-house or jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>Now go with me to <placeName reg="Berkshire, Berkshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049407">Berkshire</placeName>, less than <num value="2">two</num> men out of a <num value="100">hundred</num> are subject to the same imprisonment in that county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>Do you suppose that a county like this can rule itself with the same facility and earnestness that <persName n="Berkshire,,,,," id="n0189.0017.00190.00446" reg="mostcommon:Berkshire,nomatch:0"><surname>Berkshire</surname></persName> does?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>Of course not.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>The criminal classes, banded together, rich, massed up, are too strong for democratic institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>I avow my belief, derived from the experience of <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>, New Orleans, <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName n="New York City, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New York</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, that it will be found in the next <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, that great cities cannot be ruled by municipal governments based on democratic foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>The votes of the streets cannot execute the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>You may be astonished, indignant, incredulous; but the history of all great cities proves it. <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName> flung herself out of a government into the hands of private citizens to save herself from anarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/><placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> did the same, New Orleans did the same.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>These are the serious considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>Every man who knows his fellows well enough to judge on this question, knows that streets, planted with every <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> house a place for the public sale of drink, are not safe streets for a weak man to walk in. Every man of you knows that the mother in the country follows her son into this city with trembling prayers, not knowing whether the virtue she has carefully watched and nurtured will stand the temptation of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> streets,--the great cancer of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, the source of daily and hourly corruption; and this is the means which the <rs>State</rs> has devised to stop the otherwise immedicable wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>Now, what do we claim?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>We have the legislature by argument, the court by enactments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>We are ready to meet our opponents any time to reverse the verdict; but, until it is reversed, we claim police officer and jury to carry out the law. If that machinery succeeds, well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>If it does not succeed, something more shall <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> be devised; all the while holding ourselves open to be answered, to be disputed, to be gainsaid, before that great tribunal, the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>I wish I could impress on every man's mind to-night, this <num value="1">one</num> thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>The Temperance body ask nothing of the liquor dealer, nothing of the city, nothing of the <rs>State</rs>, which it has not already granted in essence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>We are not on trial; we have gained the battle; we only ask to reap the fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>If anybody disputes us, if anybody says the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs> is not good, that a license system would be better, we are willing to go with him into the argument; but that is argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/>We demand now that, having got the statute, we have a trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>I challenge the press of the city, the journals of the liquor dealers, to answer that claim, a trial of the statute we have richly earned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2317"/>Some say that this law cannot be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>No law is perfectly executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>Our jails and houses of correction are the evidence that no law is thoroughly executed; but what we claim is, that with fair materials, this law may be as well executed as any law as young as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>Evidence is ready at hand that in the large cities of-<placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, when there was as much wealth in proportion to numbers as here, <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the drinking was killed by the execution of the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs>; and I challenge the history of all legislation to show that any other law, <num value="1">one</num> year old on the statute-book, was ever able to kill <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the evil against which it was directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>I claim as much, if not more, for the <rs>Maine Liquor Law</rs> as any law has ever achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>When thoroughly executed, it <measure n="4" type="killed">killed four</measure> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the sin which it attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>You know well that the stranger in the streets of New York, if he is disposed to indulge in the vices that are hidden, must seek out counsel and assistance in order to enable himself to indulge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>The main who has any purpose stands firm against the temptation, but many a man who has <pb id="p.193" n="193"/> no purpose is unable to sin from lack of opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>But when you open every <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> door in the streets, it must be a Hercules who is able to stand against that temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>Shut up these tempting entrances, and <num value="7">seven</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> who enter the city for the purpose of getting a livelihood are saved from temptation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>Hide it from the investigation of the law, compel it to retreat into private cellars, and a man must seek it,--seek it with advice, seek it with assistance,--before he can fall through that sieve of deficient opportunity into shameful indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>There will be only a <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> or <num value="0.2">a <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num></num> who will contrive the way to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>Every man acquainted with the history of city indulgence, in this and similar crimes, knows well this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>Hide the sale of liquors, and we save our sons and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>Execute this law, and the streets of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, if not entirely clean, are yet as safe as a country town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>The mother can trust her boy, the wife her husband, the brother his brother, in these streets of the capital, for education, for trade, for pleasure, without following him with a pang.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>I contend that no man needs argument, no man needs evidence on such a subject as this; and no man has lived <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> who has not seen his pathway of life marked by the graves of some that he loved most, from whose promise he augured most, whose career was to be the brightest, who have not fallen at his side, victims to this sin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>I have only such a tale to: tell as every <num value="1">one</num> of your hearts bears witness to. Lawyer, merchant, divine,--no matter where you take your testimony, every man's heart is full, every man's memory is the most accusing witness against this great social <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>I am no sentimentalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/>The keen arrows of dreadful experience, which every year makes more intense and more emphatic, are my inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>I believe in it as a great national security, but I argue it as a great individual duty resting upon every man who judges his own past, or who has any pity for his neighbor. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>I am to offer you some remarks on a lecture delivered here a fortnight ago by <persName n="Crosby,Chancellor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00195.00450" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chancellor">Chancellor</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>He denounced the <name>Temperance</name> movement as now conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>The address was not very remarkable for novelty, or weight of argument, or the correctness of its statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>Indeed, it was rather noticeable for the lack of these qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>And it was so well handled and so fully answered in several of our pulpits that I thought it needed no further notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>But you thought otherwise, and perhaps it does deserve it, considering the source from which it comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>And when the health of the chancellor becomes the standing toast in the grog-shops of our city, and when the journal which publishes these <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> lectures is obliged to print a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> edition, day after day, to supply that class of customers, it is evident that Temperance men have a text on which an effectual Temperance sermon can be preached,--<num value="1">one</num> that will probably arrest the attention of just those we seek to reach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/><persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00195.00451" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> laments the divisions among Temperance men, and lays it down as a principle that we <quote>cannot <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> conscientiously object to the means employed by others, unless they contain an immorality.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>I beg leave to dissent from this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>We have had <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> experience in Temperance methods, and certainly may claim to have learned something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2350"/>Now, when these new converts-these nursling babies of grace-mislead by their crude suggestions the <name>Temperance</name> public, obstruct its efforts and waste its means, are we bound to sit silent and make no protest against such waste and recklessness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>The treasury of reform is not rich enough to bear such extravagance on the pretence of harmony; much less are we bound to silence when a neighbor's mistake seriously harms and hinders the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2352"/>If <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> lived, as it did in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>, with no steam fire-engine,--only leather buckets hanging in each man's front entry,--cheerfully would I stand with <persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00196.00452" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> and a <num value="100">hundred</num> more to pass buckets of water up to the firemen on a burning building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>But in <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct>, I should not obstruct the engine, and crowd it out of its place, merely that <persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00196.00453" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> and I might have a chance harmoniously to unite in passing <hi rend="italics">empty</hi> buckets toward the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2354"/>Life is too short for such false courtesies; too short for us to postpone working on our line until we have educated every new convert up to our level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2355"/>This might do very well before the <name>Flood</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2356"/>as <persName n="Smith,,Sydney,,," id="n0189.0018.00196.00454" reg="default:Smith,Sydney,,,"><foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> suggests, when Methuselah could consult his friends for a <measure n="150years" type="date">hundred and fifty years</measure> in relation to an intended enterprise, and even when live to see the working of his plan, and its success or failure, for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7centuries" type="date">seven centuries</measure> afterward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2357"/>But life now is limited to an average of <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>, and practical men must put their hands to the plough in the best way they know, and if children stand in their way, move them gently but firmly out of the path.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>I think before <persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00196.00455" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> spoke he should have studied the history of the <name>Temperance</name> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>If he were as <pb id="p.197" n="197"/> familiar with the literature of our enterprise as he is with that of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, he never would have repeated criticisms and suggestions that have been answered over and over again during the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. As I turn over his essay, and find how tediously familiar we all are with his objections, I am reminded of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0189.0018.00197.00456" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Sam,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s objection to <persName n="Goldsmith,,,,," id="n0189.0018.00197.00457" reg="mostcommon:Goldsmith,nomatch:0"><surname>Goldsmith</surname></persName>'s plan of travelling over <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName> in order to bring home valuable improvements: <quote>Sir, <persName n="Goldsmith,,,,," id="n0189.0018.00197.00458" reg="mostcommon:Goldsmith,nomatch:0"><surname>Goldsmith</surname></persName> is so ignorant of his own country that he would bring home a wheelbarrow as a new and valuable invention.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>The address turns back on its path frequently, and repeats its chief criticisms again and again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>If we analyze it, I think it may be fairly summed up thus:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/><num value="1">1</num>. <persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00197.00459" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> objects to the Total-abstinence theory and movement that it insults the example of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>; that its advocates undermine and despise the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, while they strain and wrench it to serve their purpose; and he asserts that the <quote>Total-abstinence system is contrary to revealed religion ;</quote> and that the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, correctly interpreted, repudiates total abstinence and such a Temperance crusade as has existed here for the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/><num value="2">2</num>. <persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00197.00460" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> objects to this movement as immoral as well as unchristian; and as <quote>doing unmeasured harm to the community.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>He considers it as the special and direct cause of the <quote>growth of drunkenness in our land, and of a general demoralization among religious communities;</quote> asserts that it is exactly the kind of movement that rumsellers enjoy, and that it ought not to succeed, never will, and never can.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/><num value="3">3</num>. The pledge is unmanly, and kills character and self-respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/><num value="4">4</num>. The assertion that moderate drinking leads to drunkenness is untrue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/><num value="5">5</num>. The total-abstainers bully and intimidate the community, and disgust all good, sensible men. <pb id="p.198" n="198"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/><num value="6">6</num>. That what is needed to unite sensible men in a movement sure to succeed, is a license system recognizing the distinction between moderation and excess, between harmless wines, and beer and strong drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>Such a system, <quote>free from taint of prejudice, and instinct with practical wisdom, will establish order and peace, and save us from a moral slough.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>The looseness of these statements is noticeable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>What is the <quote>Total-abstinence system</quote> ? It is abstaining from intoxicating drink ourselves, and agreeing with others to do so. How is this contrary to revealed religion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>Can any <num value="1">one</num> cite a text in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> or a principle laid down there which forbids it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>Of course not; no <num value="1">one</num> pretends that he can.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>There is no proof that he ever did drink intoxicating wine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>But let that pass, and suppose, for the sake of the argument, that he did. What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>To do what <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> never did, or to refuse to do what he did, are such acts <hi rend="italics">necessarily</hi> <quote>contrary to revealed religion</quote> ? Let us see.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>We find it convenient to use railways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>Are they <quote>contrary to revealed religion</quote> ? <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> never married, neither did most of his apostles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>Is marriage, therefore, <quote>contrary to revealed religion</quote> ? <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> allowed a husband to put away his wife if she had committed adultery, he himself being judge and executioner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>We forbid him to do it, and make him submit to jury trial and a judge's decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2383"/>Are such divorce laws, therefore, <quote>contrary to revealed religion</quote> ? <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> said to the person guilty of adultery: <quote>Go and sin no more.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/>We send such sinners to the <rs>State</rs> prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>Are our laws punishing <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> adultery, therefore, <quote>contrary to revealed religion</quote> ? There were no women at the <rs>Last Supper</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>We admit them to it. Is this <quote>contrary to revealed religion</quote> ?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>But the learned lecturer will perhaps urge: <quote>I did not mean exactly what I said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>I meant to point out that the means you use &mdash; methods with which you urge and support the Total-abstinence theory &mdash; are contrary to revealed religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>You strain and pervert the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> to get the example of <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> on your side, and so undermine the authority of the <name>Scriptures</name>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>It would have been better if <persName n="Crosby,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0018.00199.00463" reg="mostcommon:Crosby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crosby</surname></persName> had originally said exactly what he meant, and on so grave a subject we had a right to claim that a trained and scholarly man should do so. But, waiving that, let us allow him, as the courts do, to amend his declaration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>The Total-abstinence system is <quote>contrary to revealed religion,</quote> because we strain and distort the <name>Scriptures</name> and wrest them to serve our purpose; and the chief instance upon which the <rs>Doctor</rs> mainly dwells is our assertion that wherever drinking wine is referred to in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> with approbation, <hi rend="italics">unfermented</hi> wine is meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>Upon this claim the <rs>Doctor</rs> pours out his hottest indignation, indulging in a wealth of abusive epithets, and returning to it again and again, ringing changes on it, and turning it like a specially sweet morsel under his tongue.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/>I wish to say <num value="1">one</num> word in regard to the remarks which have been addressed to us, in order that the <name>Antislavery</name> enterprise may stand aright before this audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>It might be judged from the tone of the last speaker, that the <name>Abolitionists</name> see an enemy and an obstacle in the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>He has been entreating us to have greater regard for the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>He has been endeavoring to impress upon us reverence for that book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>You might draw the inference that we needed such entreaties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>Now, in behalf of the <name>Abolitionists</name>, let me say, we have nothing to do with the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> in regard to its merits or its faults, except in <num value="1">one</num> point: does it sustain or rebuke slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>If any speaker wanders beyond that, he speaks on his own responsibility; he speaks that for which this society is not amenable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>Perhaps it may be impossible for him to avoid expressing his private opinion of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> as to other points, in the course of illustrating some Antislavery topic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Yet you are to take them as illustrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>And when my friend <persName n="Foster,,,,," id="n0189.0022.00244.00628" reg="mostcommon:Foster,John,,,:1"><surname>Foster</surname></persName> introduced <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> some speculations of his own, on other points than slavery, he had no right to do it otherwise than as illustrations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>Now, the friend who has just spoken will, I think, grant us this,--that no speaker, unless it be <persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0022.00245.00629" reg="mostcommon:Foster,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>, has wandered beyond the just limits of Antislavery discussion; that our Antislavery speakers have never yet allowed that the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> sustained slavery; that we have felt no need, therefore, to throw it overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>And all though we may put the question like my friend <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0189.0022.00245.00630" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Henry,C.,,:1"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>, What would you do in certain circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>let it be remembered that the <name>Antislavery</name> enterprise puts such circumstances as merely fictitious, hypothetical,--and claims the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> on its own side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>[Prolonged applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>Remember, that although we feel there is enough in mere humanity, without the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, to condemn slavery; that the verdict against it is so self-evident as to destroy the title of any book to be thought inspired which sanctions such a system,--still we, so far from bringing any such accusation against the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, have always claimed it in behalf of justice and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>It is from <persName n="Stuart,,Moses,,," id="n0189.0022.00245.00631" reg="default:Stuart,Moses,,,"><foreName>Moses</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, it is from <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName>, it is from the <rs type="place">Church</rs> and the politicians, that this attack on the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> comes, and not from us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>I contend that everything that has been said, that the principles of these resolutions, that the substratum of all that has been spoken, all claim the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> as a basis; and that, confident the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> is on our side, we will not be forced into any position of seeming hostility to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/><num value="1">One</num> is this: you allow it to be occupied by men and by women, by black men and white men, by the clergy and by laymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>It seems to me the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that the central idea of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> has gotten expression; for if there be anything that lies at the very root of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> moral life, it is a protest against the idea of a priesthood,--a select class, set apart with peculiar authority, and capable, and they alone, of peculiar functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>Our churches have drifted away from the old idea; but <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> was the vanguard of that Protestant protest against the idea of a priest,--the idea <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> that the laying on of hands, or the consent of a brotherhood of peculiar devotion, could so set apart <num value="1">one</num> individual as to make him more capable of certain functions, or more entitled to instruct.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>Let us look now for a moment at the essence of the pulpit, and in order to that, in a moment, I will read you my text.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>There is no mystery about a pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>There is no necessary connection between a church and a pulpit, a very common mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>You may have as much or as little of a church as you please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>I believe in <pb id="p.255" n="255"/> more of a church than most of you do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>I think that to a certain extent the <quote>ordinances</quote> of what are called churches are good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Understand me, I would never join <num value="1">one</num> of those petty despotisms which usurp in our day the name of a <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>They are totally distinct elements, the devotional and the morally intellectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>The pulpit springs into being whenever there is an earthquake in society, whenever the great intellectual heavens are broken up, and men begin to shape their purposes and plans anew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>Whenever a nation is passing through a transition period in its thought, then the pulpit springs into being and special value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>The prophets, <persName><foreName>Jeremiah</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Isaiah</foreName></persName>, were a totally distinct body, and they were a pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>The pulpit, therefore, you perceive by this very statement, must shape itself according to its time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>Its object is not distinctly to educate, as we most often use that word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>Here is the division of the spheres of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>The theatre amuses, the press instructs, the pulpit improves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>Education with the motive of moral purpose is the essence of the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>That element has always existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>Let me glance a moment at its different forms, and then come down to ours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>Among the <name>Jews</name>, what you read in the last half of the Old Testament, that is a pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>It covered everything; it covered politics, national manners, the thoughts, sins, and customs of the day. Everything that made the intellect of Judea, <persName><foreName>Isaiah</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Jeremiah</foreName></persName> touched upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>Their diocese was as broad as conscience, no matter how broad those limits were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>If you went to <placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> had <num value="2">two</num> instruments of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>She had the theatre, and she had the public assembly, like our legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>There being no books,--that is, not enough to need mentioning,--and a very small circle of learned men in the academy, the people got what ideas they did get from the theatre on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and from the orators' discussion of national affairs, on the other; and the effect of that method was, that neither the <num value="1">one</num> nor the other <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> had a distinctly moral purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>The theatre was amusement, was intellect: politics was success, no broader than <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName>,--to make the <name>Greek</name> keep the <name>Barbarian</name> under his feet; the means, war,--that was the end of politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>When Christianity came she had to fight her way against the customs, the fashion, and the intellect of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>Instantly she leaped into the pulpit, and her sons preached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>The Apostles preached; all the earl ages preached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>The last half of the New Testament, the letters of the <name>Fathers</name>, everything that has come down to us from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3centuries" type="date">three centuries</measure>, is controversial; it is aggressive; it is an attempt to dislodge <num value="1">one</num> idea and plant another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>It was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>When it was done, the age went to sleep in its hermitage; it went to sleep in sentiment, and the pulpit died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/><persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName> sprang into existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>He wanted to wake the mind of the people from its long dream of a holiness that abounded in emotions; he wanted to plant an intellectual vigor of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>Instantly he seized the pulpit; and during that age the pulpit covered everything that we call the newspaper-press, literature, politics, religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/><persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName> wrote upon everything, he spoke upon everything; and so did his compeers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>There was no question, public or private, that the pulpit did not deal with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>That was the secret of its influence; it was a live man speaking to men alive on all live questions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>Now we come down to our day. We have things that call themselves pulpits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>And here I want to read you my text.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/></p> 
<p> It will not do to make the pulpit talents of the preacher the main motive-impulse of attraction to the meeting-house on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>Our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> people, especially, have been falling into an error here, and the interests of religious institutions among us are feeling the effects of it. The courses of lyceum and miscellaneous lectures, which are provided for annually in our cities and towns, enlist the services of a few gifted men of extraordinary popular talents, who seize upon fascinating subjects and treat them with a fantastic skill, and so are listened to with a lively interest by mixed and sometimes crowded audiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>These men &mdash; picked out of the whole mass of cultivated, scholarly, or eloquent writers and speakers in our communities &mdash; have a whole year for the composition of <num value="1">one</num> of their lectures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>They learn what is the popular taste, and they adapt themselves to it, not always trying or helping to improve it Some of their lectures are not really half so good or sensible or instructive as ordinary sermons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>If you were to take them apart, you could not put them together again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>Occasionally they are positively unwholesome and mischievous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>But these lectures, such as they are, indicate and help to fix a standard for public discourses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>People get the names of a few speakers or racy lecturers on their lips, and are apt to judge of common preaching as it <pb id="p.259" n="259"/> compares with the lively talk and discursive essays of these itinerants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>They call preaching dull and commonplace by comparison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/>And so it is; just as a corn-field or grain-field or potato-field or any other spread of acres covered with substantial food or fodder of daily life, is dull in comparison with a little garden patch of peonies, marigold, and poppies, pinks, and coxcombs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/>If some of these lyceum attendants could only overhear the secret banter of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> itinerant lecturers, as to the sort of stuff which <hi rend="italics">takes with the people</hi>, the homoeopathic doses of sound wisdom and the lavish mixture of light nutriment which suits the popular fancy, perhaps such hearers might not be flattered by the information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/>Now, it may as well be confessed that the preacher of weekly sermons cannot treat the commonplace themes of sober and homely truth so as to tickle itching ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/>Altogether too much is expected of preaching; and that preaching which many like most to hear does them the least benefit.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/>Now, that is half truth, and <num value="0.5">a half</num> truth often does as much harm as a whole lie. It is no doubt true that you cannot take a platform, and let successively a dozen of the ablest men in the community occupy it, without making it more attractive than the same platform occupied continuously by <num value="1">one</num> able man; but it is not true that the lyceum owes its interest to the <quote>sparkling talk and lively rattle</quote> of its lecturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>It is not true that the pulpit may trace its weakness to the <quote>commonplace treatment of sober and homely truth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/>Let me show you this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>The <quote><orgName n="Mercantile Library" type="library">Mercantile library</orgName> Association</quote> of this city for years engaged almost the same men that you do to occupy the platform of its lyceum course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>That lyceum course is dead and buried; yours still lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>Not because you have gotten better men, abler men, with more <quote>sparkling talk and lively rattle</quote> than they have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/><persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0189.0023.00259.00658" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> did not fill these walls because of his unmatched pulpit talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>It was because all that he thought, <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> all that he planned, all that he read, all that he lived, he brought here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>All the great topics that make the court, the street, the caucus,--life,--interesting to you, he brought here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>All that makes your life a <hi rend="italics">life</hi> he brought here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>That is what gives interest to this pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>If we go to see the <hi rend="italics">androides</hi>--as we used to when we were children &mdash; which can haul a wheelbarrow out, and water a plot of ground, and whip the children, and strike the hour of he day on the clock, we do not go more than once; in once we have seen all that they can do. The moment the world realizes that the pulpit has a limit which it cannot pass; that they are not seeing a man there, but the puppet of something behind; that when you have seen the performance once or twice you have gauged the extent, sounded the bottom,--men do not go more than twice, unless attracted by some rare rhetorical gift, as they crowded long ago to hear <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n0189.0023.00260.00659" reg="nearbymention:Everett,Edward,,,"><surname>Everett</surname></persName> read the <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> chapter of <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Corinthians in <orgName n="Brattle Street Church" type="church">Brattle-Street Church</orgName>, the same as some hang night after night on the same words from <persName n="Kean,,,,," id="n0189.0023.00260.00660" reg="mostcommon:Kean,nomatch:0"><surname>Kean</surname></persName> or <persName n="Rachel,,,,," id="n0189.0023.00260.00661" reg="mostcommon:Rachel,nomatch:0"><surname>Rachel</surname></persName>; unless they go from the motive of example, from a sense of duty, from an idea of supporting the religious institutions of their times,--as <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0189.0023.00260.00662" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, you know, said he found, on inquiry, that <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the people who attended his preaching attended from a sense of duty to the other <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>Now, that is not a pulpit, in the sense of being able to keep the mind of an age. Mark me, I am not speaking in any bitterness toward the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>I have no more bitterness than the municipality of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> has when it cuts down an old street in order to make a new thoroughfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>My opinion is, that the age, in order to get all its advantage from the pulpit, needs a new type of the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>Look at our life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>The press, flooding us every day with ideas; the theatre, open to very serious objections, yet sometimes lifting the people by addressing its love of <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> amusement, which is a beautiful, necessary, and useful part of our nature; on the other side, government, energizing the elements of popular life into greater extent of being than they ever had before, by committing to the masses the great questions of the age; business, taking up the <num value="4">four</num> corners of the globe, feeding nations, changing the current of commerce, supplying wants, creating wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>Side by side with these stands an instrumentality of education which does not advance a whit, which does not attempt to make the life of the nation its business.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/><persName n="Beecher,,Henry,Ward,," id="n0189.0023.00261.00663" reg="default:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Ward</foreName> <surname>Beecher</surname></persName> said last week in his pulpit that the <name>Antislavery</name> enterprise was not owing in any degree to the <rs type="place">Church</rs>; that it had its origin, its life, its strength outside of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>What a confession!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>You know yourselves, that in regard to <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of these pulpits in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, no man who sits beneath them ever expects to learn, or does learn, his duty, as a voter, for instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>Take the single question of the position of woman, on the result of which hangs the moral condition of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>On a law to be passed by the legislature hangs the right of the laboring mother to the possession of her wages; out of that grows the welfare of the child, care of its training, preservation of home, the lessening of temptation, the drying up of the great cancer of social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest, if not the greatest, moral question of our day. I certainly should not exaggerate if I said that a man might attend <num value="99">ninety-nine</num> out of a <num value="100">hundred</num> pulpits from here to New Orleans, and he would never have his course as a voter on that question enlightened or directed, or have <num value="1">one</num> motive addressed to him, -not <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>I might take Temperance, I might take any other of the great social questions of the day, and you would know, as I do, that the last place where a man would have his moral nature awakened and melted would be <pb id="p.262" n="262"/> the pulpits of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>It is not my business now to complain of them; I am not here to find fault with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>They do as well as they can; they fulfil their contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>They exist for a different purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>The fault is not in the tenant of the pulpit; the fault is in that corrupt sentiment which belittles the pulpit, which supposes that it comes with <quote>homely and sober truth,</quote> meaning by that, that it comes with something that everybody has heard a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times, and is tired of hearing; that it comes with something that a man <hi rend="italics">submits</hi> to hear, but has no interest in hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>Of course their real and great sin is, that while conscious of this inherent slavery of their position, they still pretend to be independent in thought and speech, to speak unfettered, and, as some claim and many believe, by exclusive right, for <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>I affirm, with no bitterness of spirit, but as an American interested in the great machinery that is to create the future,--I affirm that the pulpit of this country, tenanted though it is by some of the best educated and some of the ablest men in the country, does not hold the helm of the intellectual life of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>It does not guide the thought, as it did in the early ages of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>It has a momentous influence, but it is only through dread and awe. It has made the masses afraid to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>It has told them that thought is infidelity, that intellectual activity is ruin; and they look up to it, thinking that stupidity is heaven, that chaining thought is agreeable to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that suicide of the mind is doing honor to the <name>Maker</name> who gave us mind; and having drilled the people into that superstition, the pulpit broods over it like a nightmare; but it does not lead them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>There are clergymen who lead the thought of their time, but they do not lead it through the pulpit, they lead it through the pros, through reviews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>They throw off the <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> shackles when they get into the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Christian Examiner" type="newspaper">Christian Examiner</orgName></hi>, into the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="North American Review" type="newspaper">North American Review</orgName></hi>, or into any other of the channels of active life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>But the sin of this pulpit is, that it permits you to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>Now, I value the <name>Sunday</name> for this,--it is <num value="1">one</num> step toward intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>The Devil invented work,--I mean forced work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>Heaven is leisure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>When we clutched a day and gave it to the mind, we just redeemed <num value="1">one</num> <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> of the time from the <name>Devil</name>, and gave it to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>You may use that in <num value="2">two</num> ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>You may use it as a mere intellectual instrumentality ; but the mere culture of the intellect does not make a man. Take a common man and teach him to read; lift him up into intellectual life, as the newspaper does, as the review does; and take him in the mass,--he will not murder, he will not rob, he will not knock a man down in the highway, the crimes of violence will decrease; but he will steal, he will cheat on the <rs>Stock Exchange</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>The channel of the intellect becomes the channel in which his character and nature move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>Now, the <hi rend="italics">world</hi> has reached that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>The press has done its work marvellously well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>Politics has done its work; it has taken the vassal and lifted him up into a voter; it has taken the mere plodder in the ditch and lifted him up into a man whose thought makes industry gainful and wealth more safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>So far you have done a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>Now what you want in addition is a literature that has a moral purpose,--that is, you want a pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>In order to that, it must cover the whole sphere of intellectual life,--sanitary questions, social questions, health of the body, marriage, slavery, labor, the owning of land, temperance, the laws of society, the condition of woman, the nature of government, the responsibility to law, the right of a majority, how far a minority need to yield.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>All these are the moral questions of our day,--not <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> metaphysics, not dogmas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>Hindostan settled these thou sands of years ago. Christianity did not bury itself in the pit of <placeName reg="Oriental, Okfuskee, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2560760">Oriental</placeName> metaphysics; neither did it shroud itself in the hermitage of <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0189.0023.00264.00664" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName> emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>The pulpit is not, as seen in the north-west of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and in this country, a thing built up of mahogany and paint and prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>It is the life of an earnest man; it is the example of the citizen, the reformer, the thinker, the man, who means to hold up, help, broaden, and unfold his brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>That is a pulpit; and that is the reason you and I owe it to the community in which we live to perpetuate such a pulpit as this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/>You observe, you cannot get the ultimate and entire good from such an institution when you confine its functions to a class, when you set apart a certain body of men to minister at it. In the first place, that is a priesthood, the <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> instantly comes into existence, and they begin to plot against their neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>In the next place, they cannot know life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can know life except from suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>A man cannot argue the <rs>Woman Question</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>Literary men never do justice to the wrongs or duties of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>We know nothing of slavery; we never shall know it until <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> hand sweeps the strings of <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of broken hearts, and lets us hear from the plantations of the <rs>Southern</rs> half of this nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>It is in the protest of men ground ^own under some wrong principle that the world learns the depth and the extent of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>It is only, therefore, by putting into this desk women as well as men, all races, all professions, that you will sound the diapason of man's moral and intellectual nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>And that is what has been done in every great moving age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>The early idea of Christianity was that of a <hi rend="italics">free</hi> church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>What is the meaning of those directions in which the <name>Apostles</name> said, <quote>Let your women keep silence <pb id="p.265" n="265"/> in the churches</quote> ? Do you not see without going into the nature of that command that it is evident from the very prohibition that everybody was in the habit of speaking, men and women, every <num value="1">one</num> that sat in the church?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>The early Church was not like the <rs type="place">Catskill Falls</rs>, where, when you crawl up to see them, a man pulls away a board and lets the water down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>Everybody spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>The purposes, the wants, the thoughts, the hopes of every <name>Christian</name> man bubbled up to the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>Now there are practical difficulties in the way of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>Our ideal is to stand midway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>He goes, because his heart is there half an hour before he is. He goes, because he cannot stay away; because there are live men there who are making his cradle safer; who, with earnest blows on the hot iron of the present, are to shape his future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>He goes to share in the great struggle, and glow in the electric conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>You do not need to have societies to preach to men the duty of going to <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>That organ plays itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>The real pulpit does not need <persName n="Ellis,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0023.00265.00665" reg="mostcommon:Ellis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName>'s apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>That is what I would have you continue here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>I see that in order to do that it is necessary we should breast for a time the prejudice of a community which thinks that an example like yours is uprooting what are called, emphatically and particularly, the religious institutions of the country f but that it seems to me is founded in this mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>The reason why <persName n="Ellis,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0023.00267.00670" reg="mostcommon:Ellis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName> has to apologize for the pulpit is simply this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>It is a melancholy truth, and it is a truth which seems harsh in the saying, but it is a true saying, and it is <num value="1">one</num> necessary that somebody should say, that, instead of being a moral agency, an intellectual instrumentality in <num value="0.5">one half</num> the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> towns, the pulpit is merely an appendage to the factory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>The minister is just as much employed to preach, as the operative is to tend the loom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>The owner of the works as truly settles the length of the pastor's tether as that owner does the amount of water which it is prudent to allow on the dam. The extent of his authority, the amount of his freedom, the depth of his intellect, are all <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> bought and paid for. There is a class of men who go and look up to him, conceiving that he tells them all he thinks, and for a while they live contented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>But in fact, the master-hand of that wealth which commands the town, as much decides the quality of the preaching on <date value="--7">Sundays</date> as he does the fineness of the cloth made weekdays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>It is merely the jugglery of wealth; merely the reflection of that same unlimited power that now, through all the avocations of life, seem so to control us. You know this as well as I do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>Now, that sort of pulpit ought not to have any influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>It needs an apology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>The lyceum is <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,2091132" n="1.000 3" reg="nazareth, northampton, pennsylvania">Nazareth</placeName> casting out its devil; and it is natural that such a preacher should say to the lyceum lecturer, <quote>Why dost thou torment me before my time?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>To the dead body, you know, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement of blood and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> element of returning life is exquisite pain; so to the mind dwarfed and fettered by such a pulpit, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entering of a thought endeavoring, with magnetic and electric circles, to new-arrange society, is exquisite pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>It ought to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>There is a class of women which is a fair gauge of the influence of this sort of pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>Shut out as women are from politics, and absorbed as this particular class is in petty cares during the week, the pulpit is all their literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>Notice how narrow and timid is their range of thought, how borrowed are all their ideas, how real their dread of some sect or person to whom or to which the pastor has given a bad name, how unaffected their anxiety when some man of the family breaks out into daring difference with the minister!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>In fact, their minds are a blurred photograph of the dwarfed, fossil, shrunken, and stunted creed the priest has substituted for the brain <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>The quiet disdain with which practical men receive <pb id="p.269" n="269"/> an argument on any topic drawn from the opinions of such a pulpit, shows the real place it fills in our great national school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>They have come to believe so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>I do not believe that our nature and race have fallen so low that wealth really will canker the whole of it. A pulpit representing moral energy, announcing its purpose to deal with each question as it arises, to trust the popular conscience, and say, <quote>If <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave you that, take it; it is no responsibility of mine;</quote> such a pulpit will put wealth <pb id="p.270" n="270"/> where it belongs, under its feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>Then the pulpit was broad enough to cover the whole intellectual and moral life of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>Our idea of a pulpit is, that wherever a moral purpose dictates earnest words to make our neighbor a better man and better citizen, to clear the clogged channels of life, to lift it to a higher level or form it on a better model, there is a pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>There is no mystery in it. You want thought, growing out of moral purpose, and a man who dares to speak it; and then you have a pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>Every man who has lived thoughtfully in the midst of the great issues that have been struggling for attention and settlement; every man who has striven to rouse to action the elemental forces of society and civilization which ought to grapple with these problems,--must have had his thoughts turned often, constantly, to the nature of Christianity itself, and to the part which it ought to claim, to the place which it really occupies, amid the great elements which are to mould our future.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>There is a great deal of talk about Christianity as the mere reflection of the morals and intellect of the passing age; as something which may be made to take any form, assume any principle, direct itself against any point, at the bidding of the spirit of its individual age. It is <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> looked upon as an ephemeral result, not as a permanent cause; and when viewed as such, men very naturally class it with the other religions of the world, which have all been results, not causes,--effects, not sources of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>As I look at Christianity in its relation to absolute religion,--religion the science of duty to ourselves, to our fellows, and to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>,--as I look at Christianity in reference to religion, I want to say at the outset that it, for me, occupies an entirely distinct place, an entirely different level from any other of what are called or have been the religions of the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>If you go to the <rs>East</rs>, for the last <measure n="3000years" type="date">three thousand years</measure> you find a religion the reflection of its civilization, the outgrowth of its thought, steeped in its animal life, dragged down by all its animal temptations, rotted through with license, with cruelty,--with all that grows out of the abnormal relation of the body to the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>And the only distinctive element in this outburst of Hindoo religions,--<persName><foreName>Buddha</foreName></persName> and Brahma too,--the only redeeming point is a sort of exceptional intellectual life, which busied itself exclusively with the future; which struggled to plan and shape life, and mould it on the principle that to be like <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, you were to trample out all human affection and interests, thought, duties, and relations; and the moment you became utterly passionless, without thought, without interest in aught external, you were godlike,--absorbed into the <name>Infinite</name> and ready for the hereafter.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>The only thing remarkable in these Asiatic religions is that they were infinitely below the popular level of morality and intelligence, while intellectually they busied themselves with nothing but the future state; not in <num value="1">one</num> single thought or effort or plan or method with man as <name n="God" type="God">God</name> places him on the surface of this planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>And it was a religion so much the actual result of the moral <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> and intellectual life, so moonlike a reflection, that in due time, after a century or <num value="2">two</num>, society in Hindostan was infinitely better than its religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>I know, of course, of the bright gems of thought that glisten here and there on their sacred pages,--original, perhaps; interpolated nobody can say when, possibly; but, whether so or not, exceptions to the broad, popular estimate of the religion of the age.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>I cannot expect, either, ladies and gentlemen, to present to you, on the topic of to-night, anything like the comprehensive views or the varied and exquisite illustrations which the speakers of the last week gave you on a kindred topic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>I am sorry to remember, even though it be to their honor, how much rarer still it is to find such men coming forward to aid in meetings like these.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>I suppose your intention is to touch all sides of the question of Popular Education, and with especial reference, so far as outsiders may, to some of the plans which engage the attention of the community and of the legislature at this moment,--plans of vast public improvement; plans of generous State aid toward great interests of the public; plans intended to make <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> the leading city of the <rs>Union</rs>, in regard to some of those intellectual gratifications and scientific attractions which our country so much lacks, which would subserve, not only the honor, but the <hi rend="italics">interest</hi> of the <rs>State</rs>, if that is to be considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>Some call the <rs>Yankee</rs> blood niggard, and think we look with suspicion upon such plans of public expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>I think we have fairly earned, we New Englanders, the character of generous patrons of all things that really claim public support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>They call us <quote>pedlers,</quote> <quote>hucksters;</quote> we are said to look upon both sides of a dollar, and all round the rim, before we spend it; and yet I <pb id="p.311" n="311"/> undertake to say, that in this very <quote>niggardly <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>,</quote> there have been, and are, not only the most generous efforts for the widest education, for the readiest relief, for the most lavish endowment of all institutions for the public, but we have set the world the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> example in many of these.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>I believe it would be found, that if we compared <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, I will not say with the rest of the <rs>Union</rs>,--for she may justly disdain such comparison,--but with <persName n="England,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00311.00762" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> itself, with any country, it would be found that a greater proportion, a larger percentage of private wealth, since its foundation, had been given and pledged to matters of public concern, than anywhere else in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>We are educated in that faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>Money-giving is the fashion,--provided you choose popular objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>Indeed, to give is so much a matter expected and of course, that the rich man's will which is opened in the latitude of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, or its neighborhood, and found not to contain ample legacies for great public objects, is set down as singular, odd,--so singular as to be marked with the stigma of public rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>It is so much a fashion, that it takes a peculiar obstinacy of stinginess even to hide itself in the grave without giving more than the <name>Jewish</name> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> to the public.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>If, therefore, the projects of State aid to great public intellectual and moral purposes should result-which I doubt &mdash; in expense to the <rs>State</rs>, they would be justified by the whole tone of the past history of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and welcomed with proud satisfaction by the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>I think we have only reached a new level in the gradual rising of public feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>Every year,--at least every decade, every generation, certainly,--originates a new step; the standpoint rises; we look at things from a different point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>We have reached <num value="1">one</num> now, when it begins to be claimed of government and <pb id="p.312" n="312"/> private individuals, that all their wealth belongs to the public; that it is mortgaged for the education of every child among us; that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave it for mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>The <rs>Egyptian</rs> kept its knowledge for priests and nobles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>Science hid itself in the cloister; it was confined to the aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>Knowledge was the organ of despotism; it was the secret of the upper classes; it was the engine of government; it was used to over-awe the people; and when <persName n="Cambyses,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00312.00764" reg="mostcommon:Cambyses,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambyses</surname></persName> came down from <placeName key="tgn,7000231" n="1.000 27" reg="iran">Persia</placeName>, and thundered across <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, treading out under his horse's hoofs royalty and priesthood, he trod out science and civilization at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>The faithful scholar, with that same timidity which marks the fastidious scholarship of to-day, replied, <quote>I think that wise men argue questions and fools decide them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>It was a scholar's judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>But you sit here to-day with the science of Egypt-its exclusive, fastidious, timid, conservative science &mdash; buried in the oblivion of <measure n="2000years" type="date">two thousand years</measure>; and you live to-day with a <num value="100">hundred</num> idioms of speech borrowed, all your art copied from <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, your institutions shaped largely on her model, and your ideas of right and wrong influenced by the hearts that throbbed in that mob of <placeName reg="Athinai, Perifereia Protevousis, Ellas" key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, <measure n="2000years" type="date">two thousand years</measure> ago!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3757"/><measure n="2000years" type="date">Two thousand years</measure> ago all government thought of was to build up its gallows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3760"/>We have gone on <measure n="2000years" type="date">two thousand years</measure>, and now we put a guide-board at the beginning, saying, <quote>This is the wrong road.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3761"/>We educate men. We have added disgrace, disfranchisement, imprisonment, moral restraint, rewards, and many other things to our list of instruments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3762"/>Government is beginning to remember that <hi rend="italics">prevention</hi> is <num value="1">one</num> of its great objects.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>Now, that idea broadens with every year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3765"/>What is Education?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3766"/>It is not simply books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3767"/>There is another idea that is dawning before us. We have been accustomed to study only books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3768"/>I believe every observing man will agree with me, that the day is dawning when we are to study <hi rend="italics">things</hi>, not books only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>I do not mean that we are to lay aside books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/>We are not to give up languages and history, and studies of that class, but I think that the study of things is to be grafted upon these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3771"/><name n="God" type="God">God's</name> works,--the beautiful in objects, the curious and useful in science, the great relations between the sciences, the laws which govern national development, the conditions of health and disease, the growth of population, the laws which crime and accident obey, the material interests of society,--the handiwork of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and his laws, the day is dawning, I think, when education will turn largely in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3772"/>The people claim of government that it should provide these museums of things; that it should, <quote>taking time by the forelock,</quote> gather up all these living books that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has made for the education of the people, and preserve them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3773"/>Science, the history of science, the details of it, as preserved in museums,--these are beginning to be, especially with us, the objects of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3774"/>They affect legislation closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3775"/>No man is up to the van of his age, if he has not, at least, a general knowledge of these relations; he is not fit to sit in this hall and legislate about them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3783"/>I will tell you what I mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>Suppose to-day you go to <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3787"/>The very atmosphere of such scenes is education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>People are not able even to live, even to stand among the evidences of the labors, <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> among the collected intellectual fruits of their fellows, without tasting something of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>If I were, therefore, speaking simply as a Massachusetts citizen, with my future interest in the hands of a democratic legislature, chosen from among the people, I should claim of the wealth of the <rs>State</rs>, of the wealth of the wealthiest, that it was all mortgaged, not for ordinary schools merely, not for book culture, not even for the costly apparatus of university life, but that, in the crowded thoroughfares of cities, there should be thrown open to the public, in every large crowd of population, the means of studying the great sciences of the day.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3790"/>If I asked it for nothing else, I would ask it as wise policy for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>It is impossible to trace the results of such provocatives of thought as these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>A name which the previous speaker used gives me an illustration pertinent to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>He spoke of <num value="1">one</num> who has just left our shores, a man eminent in every good work,--<persName n="Bowditch,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0026.00319.00773" reg="mostcommon:Bowditch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Bowditch</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>You know his family story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>His father was a poor boy, <num value="1">one</num> of those whose early privations and need after-time gathers up with loving and grateful admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>It chanced that <num value="1">one</num> of the privateers of <placeName reg="Essex, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002362">Essex county</placeName> brought in, as a prize, the extensive library of <persName n="Kirwan,Doctor,,,," id="n0189.0026.00319.00774" reg="mostcommon:Kirwan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Kirwan</surname></persName>,--a scientific man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>He was left to avail himself at will of this magazine of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>The boy grew into a man; wife and children were about him, and moderate wealth in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/><address><street n="La Place">La Place</street></address> published his sublime work, which it is said only <num value="20">twenty</num> men in the world can read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3833"/>With patient toil, with a brain which that early devotion had made strong, he mastered its contents; and was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> among the <num value="20">twenty</num> to open that great commentary on the works of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to every man who reads the <rs>English</rs> language, by translating it into our tongue, and supplying, with adroit and skilful industry, the steps by which the humblest student in mathematics may follow the giant strides of <address><street n="La Place">La Place</street></address>. The expense of publishing a work which so few would buy, would take half of his fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>That life had in part educated, perhaps, his wife to the same high-souled determination which animated him. He said to her, <quote>Shall we give our wealth to this service for posterity, shall we give it to our boys, or spend it in the pleasures of life?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3835"/><quote>Publish,</quote> was the wife's reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>He consecrated half his fortune to the <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> service of the future and the distant, to the student, and left to his children only education and example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>They stand now around us, eminent in every profession, and equally eminent for the same enthusiastic devotion, and the same prodigal liberality in every good cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>How proud might the <rs>State</rs> be, if, by opening similar libraries and museums, she educated a community of Bowditches, fathers of such children in the generations to come!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>[Loud applause.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>There is another consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>I will not pursue this subject, merely on this level; I will present even a lower <num value="1">one</num>, if you please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>I mean to come down to the business level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>We never shall compete with New York in the allurements of a great city life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>As far as magnificent spectacles, as far as metropolitan wealth, as far as the splendors and amusements of the world are concerned, the great focal metropolis of the <rs>Empire</rs>, New York, must always outdo us, in drawing vast numbers of business men and strangers to enter her streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>She can make the tide set that way constantly, and turn <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> into a dependency on her great central power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>But it lies with <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to create an attraction only <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to hers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>The blood of the <name>Puritans</name>, the old <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> peculiarities, can never compete with the <name>Parisian</name> life of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>But if we create here a great intellectual centre by our museums, by our scientific opportunities, if we become really <quote>the <rs>Athens</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>,</quote> as we assume to be, if we guard and preserve the precious gatherings of science now with us, we shall attract here a large class of intelligent and cultivated men, and thus do something to counterbalance the overshadowing influence of the great metropolis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>Why, here is the museum in <persName n="Street,Mason,,,," id="n0189.0026.00320.00776" reg="mostcommon:Street,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mason">Mason</roleName> <surname>Street</surname></persName>, which has laid a petition upon the table of this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00320.00777" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> to-day, possessed of treasures which, if lost, no skill, no industry, would replace, <pb id="p.321" n="321"/> giving to the geological and natural history of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> contributions which, if once lost, cannot be regained; treasures visited, weekly, by crowds from our schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>They should be covered safely and extended, if we would do what New York has done already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>I went, in <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, lately to a noble building which the <rs>Empire State</rs> has furnished, dedicated to this: she means that every ore, every plant, every shell, every living or extinct animal, every tree, on the surface or in the bowels of the <rs>Empire State</rs>, shall be represented in that Museum, for the study of her sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>They shall find the fauna and the flora there; they shall find the living and the dead of the <rs>State</rs> represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>It remained awhile,--so the custodian, <persName n="Jewett,Colonel,,,," id="n0189.0026.00321.00778" reg="mostcommon:Jewett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jewett</surname></persName>, told me,--for some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, without provision for its shelter and safe-keeping, and <num value="0.5">one half</num> its treasures were lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>They have placed it to-day beyond risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>They have done it in order to excite the curiosity and appreciation of their sons; they have given them the natural and scientific map of the <rs>State</rs> to study; they have called out their latent capacity for science; they have set an example for other cities; they have done thus much to educate the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>There is education in the very sight of things about us. I believe in the sentiment which would preserve yonder <placeName reg="Hancock House">Hancock House</placeName>; for the very sight of such a monument is a book pregnant with thought to the people that pass by it. A man of <num value="1">one</num> mould has, of course, no right to regard a man of another mould as necessarily his inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>But this much surely we may be allowed, to hold that philosophy as cold and heartless which <quote>conducts us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has been dignified by piety or valor.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>Certainly that profound sentiment which makes the past live for us in the scenes consecrated to the noble <pb id="p.322" n="322"/> servants and great events of our race; which deepens our sense of obligation to the future by showing us our debt to the past; which changes our little life here, from an isolated instant into the connecting link between <num value="2">two</num> eternities; which lifts the low window of some humble dwelling, and lets the genius of the past enter, till its walls expand into a palace, and we see written <quote>in glowing letters over all,</quote> the courage or virtue, the toil or self-devotion, which have made our daily life safer or more noble; which calls into being, amid the desert of low cares and dull necessities, an oasis,--and so forces us, even when most hurried or smothered in dust, to <hi rend="italics">think</hi> and <hi rend="italics">feel</hi>--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/></p><l part="F">till the place</l> <l>Becomes religion, and the heart runs o'er</l> <l>With silent worship of the great of old,--</l><l>The dead but sceptred sovereigns who still rule</l> <l>Our spirits from their urns.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>For this sentiment, no <num value="1">one</num> need blush; and often as it has been perverted, much as it has been abused, I believe in it as the mother of much that is beautiful, as a staff to resolution, as an incentive to virtue, as a pulse of that full being which lives in us when we are nearest to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>[Applause.]</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>A few years ago, I was in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, and they showed me, in the very centre of her stately streets, the original log-cabin in which <persName n="Dearborn,General,,,," id="n0189.0026.00322.00779" reg="mostcommon:Dearborn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dearborn</surname></persName> lived, before any other white man, save himself, drew breath upon that spot, now covered by the <rs n="Queen of the West" type="ship">Queen of the West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>It stood in its original, untouched, primeval condition,--the dark-stained, natural wood of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3864"/>On all sides of it rose the splendid palaces of the young <rs n="Queen of the West" type="ship">queen of western</rs> cities,--the lavish outpouring of the rapidly increasing wealth of the lakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>Roofs that covered depots, hotels, houses of commerce rivalling any to be <pb id="p.323" n="323"/> found in the spacious magnificence of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, were within a biscuit's throw of the spot; while that very evening were celebrated the nuptials, in her <num value="21" type="ordinal">twenty-first</num> year, of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> child born on that spot where stands now a city of <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> inhabitants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>It was the original ark of the city; it was the spot where her <persName n="Romulus,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00323.00780" reg="mostcommon:Romulus,nomatch:0"><surname>Romulus</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drew breath; it was the cradle of her history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>No capital in the world ever had such an opportunity of saying, when a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> old, to her <num value="1000000">million</num> sons, <quote>Behold the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> roof that told the forest man had taken possession!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3868"/>To-day it has vanished!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3869"/>There was not education, there was not sentiment, there was not historic interest, there was not that manhood which marries the past and the future and raises us above the brutes,--there was not enough of it in the young civilization of the <rs>West</rs> to save that unique specimen, testifying by its very presence to the growth, in a night, of the city of the lakes, to save from the greed of speculation or the roar of trade a spot full of such interest to every thoughtful mind!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3870"/>Would you like <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to be subject to such criticism as that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3871"/>Is there not an education of the heart of which it shows a lack?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3872"/>Evidently there is. Such public treasures, open to all, work for us all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3873"/>If you should go and stand, for instance, in <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, and see the peasant walking amid a gallery of beautiful sculpture, or wandering through the gardens of princes, surrounded with every exotic and every form of beauty in marble and bronze, you would see the reason why the <rs>Italian</rs> drinks in the love of the beautiful, until it becomes a part of him, without his thinking of it. So I think that the very sight of yonder Public Library, even to the man who does not enter its alcoves, contributes to the growth, expansion, and elevation of his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3874"/>He remembers, at least, that some men have <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> recognized that duty to the minds of their fellows, and it raises him for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3875"/>Direct study is only half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/>The influences we drink in as we live and move, do even more to mould us. It is not till these do their full work that the character is formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3877"/>Argument is not half so strong as habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3878"/>A truth is often proved long before it is felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3879"/>A man is convinced long before he is converted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3880"/>Constant, habitual, and often slight influences give us shape and direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/><persName n="Whately,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00324.00781" reg="mostcommon:Whately,nomatch:0"><surname>Whately</surname></persName> has. well said there is more truth than men think in Dogberry's solemn rebuke, <quote>Masters, it is <hi rend="italics">proved</hi> already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will go near to be <hi rend="italics">thought</hi> so shortly.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>I had supposed that I should have given place before this, to <num value="1">one</num> who would have addressed you in detail, and more specifically, in reference to the plans which engage the attention of the public; but I do not see the gentleman who has been announced as <num value="1">one</num> of the speakers this evening, <persName n="Andrew,Mister,J.,A.,," id="n0189.0026.00324.00782" reg="default:Andrew,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>, before me, and perhaps, as we have reached the hour at which these meetings usually close, it will be proper for us to adjourn, leaving that particular branch of the subject untouched and fresh for your next session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>Perhaps indeed it does not become us, not members of the legislature, to volunteer our advice or opinion on topics that are before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>But still it is to be remembered that, after all, public opinion, the opinion of all thoughtful men who have an interest in the growth and future of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> and of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, is entitled to consideration; that all of us have a right to utter our wish, to express our earnest desire, that the <rs>State</rs> should recognize, before it be too late, her duty in this respect; that she should save, while she may, this unexpected and large accession of wealth from the possibility of misuse, not let it slip from her hands till some great measures be -<pb id="p.325" n="325"/> accomplished,such measures as show us worthy, by noble thoughts, of these great trusts, for such wealth is a trust; that she should help the growth of her capital city, and with it that of the whole Commonwealth, by plans fitted for the highest culture of the people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>I welcome the action of the <rs>State</rs> for another thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3886"/>If we could snatch from dispersion, or from the purchase of some foreign capitalist, that magnificent collection which <persName n="Catlin,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00325.00783" reg="mostcommon:Catlin,nomatch:0"><surname>Catlin</surname></persName> has made for the history of the aboriginal races of this continent,--something that can never be replaced if it be once scattered and lost,--of which <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> might fairly take the custody, as the nucleus of that ethnologic study of the races, languages, and epochs of the past history of the continent, and make <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> the centre, as that <num value="1">one</num> collection would make it, of this inquiry and study, it would give a peculiar interest to our city, and a great impulse to a curious and valuable study.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3887"/>I see before me some of the women of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; and I remember that this very legislature has voted the funds of the <rs>State</rs> for <num value="48">forty-eight</num> scholarships for boys, to be instructed in our various institutions of learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3888"/>I see no reason why, with the normal schools, the district schools, and the academies of the <rs>State</rs> calling for teachers, and all departments of life calling for a more broad and liberal culture, the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Commonwealth of Massachusetts</placeName> should not raise <num value="48">forty-eight</num> scholarships for the girls of the <rs>State</rs>, so that they may enjoy the same liberal opportunities with her boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3889"/>[Applause.] It seems to me that, in connection with these noble provisions for the growth of the adult intellect, the <rs>State</rs> should remember the schools, and the various channels of woman's influence, and hold the balance even.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3890"/>I value those open institutions of learning which it is proposed to establish on yonder bay, especially because they <pb id="p.326" n="326"/> will tempt women &mdash; I mean, in an especial sense, the women in easy circumstances, not obliged to labor for bread &mdash; to imitate the example of their <name>English</name> sisters on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and make it fashionable to study the open pages of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> work as they are written out for them in the collections of museums and curiosities of the past.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3892"/>Like an exotic laid on an unfit soil,--we cannot say <hi rend="italics">planted</hi>,--it dies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3893"/>For the mere show and splendor, the luxurious pleasure, the prodigal display of social life, we have neither the wealth nor a large class of idle loungers to keep each other in countenance, and make such continual show possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3894"/>Hence, what we call society is only a herd of boys and girls, tired with the day's lessons, or just emancipated from school, met to prattle of nothing, and eat and drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3895"/>Selfishness and rude frolic, or tasteless bearing about of rich dress, and a struggle round groaning tables have usurped the place of conversation and manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>Earnest life, the cares of business take up the full grown men; disgust and weariness keep women away; these last must either contract into idle gossips, or marry to be the drudges of a life aping wealthier levels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>Old prejudice shuts them out of active life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>No social life, worthy of the name, upholds them in that wide and liberal interest in thought and science, in great questions and civil interests, which made the <rs>French</rs> woman a power in life and the <rs>State</rs>, which once separated the <rs>Quaker</rs> women from the level of their gayer sisters, which now crowds the lists of <name>English</name> literature with women, some of them the best thinkers, the greatest poets, and most faithful scholars in our mother-land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3899"/>Open these public <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> store-houses; gather these treasures of science into the lap of the <rs>State</rs>, and see if we cannot create for our women a nobler career, and call into being a society which will refine life, and win men from cares that eat out everything lofty, and sensual pleasures that make them half brutes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3900"/>All these things work for us. They would make government unnecessary, so far as it is coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3901"/>I look upon these things as I do upon the windmills <num value="1">one</num> sees all over the provinces of <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3902"/>They have shut out the ocean with dykes; past ages built up the colossal structures which save <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00327.00785" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName> from the wave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3903"/>So we have built up laws, churches, universities, to keep out from our garnered Commonwealth the flood of ignorance and passion and misrule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3904"/>But in morals as in Nature, the water which we press back upon the flood oozes daily through the mass; and the cunning <rs>Hollander</rs> for centuries, remembering this law, has placed his picturesque and wide-spread sails to catch every breeze that sweeps through the country, and as fast as Nature lets the ocean ooze through his defences, the tireless windmills lift it and pour it back into the depths of the sea, and every breeze that hurries across the province at night tells the <name>Dutchman</name>, as he listens, that his home is safer for its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3905"/>So, while you wake or sleep, these stores and associations shall do the work for you which the winds do for <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n0189.0026.00327.00786" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3906"/>As the floods of vice ooze back through your defences, they shall relieve you from the continual watching, and educate the people in spite of themselves, winning them to think, pointing them through Nature to her <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, fortifying virtue by habits that render low stimulus needless, and developing the whole man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3907"/>I think we owe all this to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3908"/>The generations that preceded us built ships, roads, cities, invented arts, <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> raised up manufactures, and left them to us. We inherit libraries and railways; we inherit factories and houses; we inherit the wealth and the industry and the culture of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3909"/>We do not do enough if we merely transmit that, or what is exactly like it, to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3910"/>No; he does not imitate his father who is just like his father, paradoxical as it may seem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3911"/>Every age that has preceded us in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> has set its ingenuity to work to find out some wider, deeper, better, more liberal, and higher method of serving posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3912"/>The <rs>Winthrops</rs>, the <name>Carvers</name>, and the <name>Brewsters</name> left us churches, planned schools, common roads, and wooden houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3913"/>The generation just gone have not only turned their wooden wharves into granite, their roads to iron, their spinning-wheels to factories that can clothe the earth in a month, but they have conquered space and the elements with steam, they have harnessed the lightning and sent it on errands; they have not only continued their churches, they have taken hold of the <num value="4">four</num> corners of the earth with their societies for the education of the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>Well, I have been a dozen times criticised by a number of wise men, in newspapers, who have said that this was a very idle tale, that there never was sufficient heat in a few bundles of sticks to produce vitrification,--glass-making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>I happened, <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, to meet, on the prairies of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, <persName n="Shepherd,Professor,,,," id="n0189.0028.00367.00966" reg="mostcommon:Shepherd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Shepherd</surname></persName>, who started from <orgName n="Yale College" type="college">Yale College</orgName>, and like a genuine <name>Yankee</name> brings up anywhere where there is anything to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>Said he, <quote>We stopped last year in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, to cook some venison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>We got down from our saddles, and put the cooking-apparatus on stones we found there; made our fire with the wood we got there, resembling ebony; and when we removed the apparatus there was pure silver gotten out of the embers by the intense heat of that almost iron wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>Now,</quote> said he, <quote>that heat was greater than any necessary to vitrify the materials of glass.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>Why not suppose that <persName><foreName>Pliny</foreName></persName>'s sailors had lighted on some exceedingly hard wood?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>May it not be as possible as in this case?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>So, ladies and gentlemen, with a growing habit of distrust of a large share of this modern and exceedingly scientific criticism of ancient records, I think we have been betraying our own ignorance, and that frequently, when the statement does not look, on the face of it, to be exactly accurate, a little investigation below the surface will show that it rests on a real truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4332"/>Take, for instance, the <rs>English</rs> proverb which was often quoted in my college days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>We used to think how little logic the common people had; and when we wanted to illustrate this in the school-room,--it was what was called a <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> <foreign lang="la">non sequitur:</foreign> the effect did not come from the cause named,--we always quoted the <rs>English</rs> proverb, <quote><persName><foreName>Tenterden</foreName></persName> steeple is the cause of <persName n="Sands,,Goodwin,,," id="n0189.0028.00368.00967" reg="default:Sands,Goodwin,,,"><foreName>Goodwin</foreName> <surname>Sands</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>We said, <quote>How ignorant a population!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>But when we went deeper into the history, we found that the proverb was not meant for logic, but was meant for sarcasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/><num value="1">One</num> of the bishops had <measure n="50000l." type="pounds"><num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> pounds</measure> given to him, to build a breakwater to save the <rs>Goodwin Sands</rs> from the advancing sea; but the good bishop,--being <num value="1">one</num> of the kind of bishops which <persName n="Froude,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0028.00368.00968" reg="mostcommon:Froude,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Froude</surname></persName> describes in his lecture, that the world would be better if <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> would remove them from it,--instead of building the breakwater to keep out the sea, simply built a steeple; and this proverb was sarcastic, and not logical, that <quote><persName><foreName>Tenterden</foreName></persName> steeple was the cause of the <rs>Goodwin Sands</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>When you contemplate the motive, there was the closest and best-welded logic in the proverb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>So I think a large share of our criticism of old legends and old statements will be found in the end to be the ignorance that overleaps its own saddle, and falls on the other side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>Well, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> illustration ought to be this material, glass; but, before I proceed to talk of these lost arts, I ought in fairness to make an exception,--and it is the conception and conceit which lies here.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>No matter now that, unable to lead and form the nation, he was contented to be only its representative and mouthpiece; no matter that, with prejudices hanging about him, he groped his way very slowly and sometimes reluctantly forward: let us remember how patient he was of contradiction, how little obstinate in opinion, how willing, like <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bacon</foreName></persName>, <quote>to light his torch at every man's candle.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5353"/>Some of us can recollect, only <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago, the large and loving group that lived and worked together; the joy of companionship, sympathy with each other,--almost our only joy, for the outlook was very dark, and our toil seemed almost vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5354"/>The world's dislike of what we aimed at, the social frown, obliged us to be all the world to each other; and yet it was a full life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5355"/>The life was worth living; the labor was its own reward; we lacked nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5356"/>As I stand by this dust, my thoughts go freshly back to those pleasant years when the warp and woof of her life were woven so close to the rest of us; when the sight of it was such an inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5357"/>How cheerfully she took up daily the burden of sacrifice and effort!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5358"/>With what serene courage she looked into the face of peril to her own life, and to those who were dearer to her than <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5359"/>A young bride brought under such dark skies, and so ready for them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5360"/>Trained among Friends, with the blood of martyrdom and self-sacrifice in her veins, she came so naturally to the altar!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5361"/>And when the gallows was erected in front of the young bride's windows, never from that stout soul did the husband get look or word that bade him do anything but go steadily forward, and take no counsel of man. Sheltered in the jail, a great city hunting for his life, how strong he must have been when they brought him his young wife's brave words: <quote>I know my husband will never betray his principles!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5362"/>Helpmeet, indeed, for the pioneer in that terrible fight!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5363"/>The most unselfish of human beings, she poured all her strength into the lives of those about her, without asking acknowledgment or recognition, unconscious of the sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5364"/>With marvellous ability, what would have been weary burdens to others, she lifted so gayly!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5365"/>A young mother, with the cares of a growing family, not rich in means, only her own hands to help, yet never failing in cheerful welcome to every call; doing for others as if her life was all leisure and her hands full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5366"/>What rare executive ability, doing a great deal, and so easily as to never seem burdened!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5367"/>Who ever saw her reluct at any sacrifice her own purpose or her husband's made necessary?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5368"/>No matter how long and weary the absence, no matter how lonely he left her, she cheered and strengthened him to the sacrifice if his great cause asked it. The fair current of her husband's grand purpose swept on unchecked by any distracting anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5369"/>Her energy and unselfishness left him all his strength free for the world's service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5370"/>Many of you have seen her only in years when illness hindered her power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5371"/>You can hardly appreciate the large help she gave the <name>Antislavery</name> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5372"/><pb id="p.456" n="456"/></p> 
<p>That home was a great help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5373"/>Her husband's word and pen scattered his purpose far and wide; but the comrades that his ideas brought to his side her welcome melted into friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5374"/>No matter how various and discordant they were in many things; no matter how much there was to bear and overlook,--her patience and her thanks for their sympathy in the great idea were always sufficient for this work also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5375"/>She made a family of them, and her roof was always a home for all. I never shall forget the deep feeling &mdash; his voice almost breaking to tears &mdash; with which <persName n="Wright,,Henry,C.,," id="n0189.0033.00456.01409" reg="default:Wright,Henry,C.,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> told me of the debt his desolate life owed to this home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5376"/>And who shall say how much that served the great cause?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5377"/>Yet drudgery did not choke thought; care never narrowed her interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5378"/>She was not merely the mother, or head of the home; her own life and her husband's moved hand in hand in such loving accord, seemed so exactly <num value="1">one</num>, that it was hard to divide their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5379"/>At the fireside; in the hours, not frequent, of relaxation; in scenes of stormy debate,--that beautiful presence, of rare sweetness and dignity, what an inspiration and power it was!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5380"/>And then the mother,--fond, painstaking, faithful!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5381"/>No mother who bars every generous thought out from her life, and in severe seclusion forgets everything but her children,--no such mother was ever more exact in every duty, ready for every care, faithful at every point, more lavish in fond thoughtfulness, than this mother, whose cares never narrowed the broad idea of life she brought from her girlhood's home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5382"/>Who can forget her modest dignity &mdash; shrinkingly modest, yet ever equal to the high place events called her to?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5383"/>In that group of remarkable men and women which the <name>Antislavery</name> movement drew together, she had her own niche, which no <num value="1">one</num> else could have filled so perfectly or unconsciously as she did. And in that <pb id="p.457" n="457"/> rounded life no over zeal in <num value="1">one</num> channel, no extra service at <num value="1">one</num> point, needs be offered as excuse for short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5384"/>coming elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5385"/>She forgot, omitted nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5386"/>How much we all owe to her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5387"/>She is not dead,--she has gone before; but she has not gone away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5388"/>Nearer than ever, this very hour she watches and ministers to those in whose lives she was so wrapped; to whose happiness she was so devoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5389"/>Who thinks that loving heart could be happy if it were not allowed to minister to those she loved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5390"/>How easy it is to fancy the welcome the old faces have given her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5391"/>The honored faces, the familiar faces, the old tones, that have carried her back to the pleasant years of health and strength and willing labor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5392"/>How gladly she broke the bonds that hindered her activity!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5393"/>There are more there than here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5394"/>Very slight the change seems to her. She has not left us, she has rejoined them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5395"/>She has joined the old band that worked life-long for the true and good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5396"/>The dear, familiar names, how freshly they come to our lips!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5397"/>We can see them bend over and lift her up to them, to a broader life: Faith is sight to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5398"/>She works on a higher level; ministers to old ideas; guards those she went through life with so lovingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5399"/>Even in that higher work they watch for our coming also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5400"/>Let the years yet spared us here be a warning to make ourselves fit for that companionship!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5401"/>The separation is hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5402"/>Nature will have its way. <quote>The heart knoweth its own bitterness,</quote> and for a while loves to dwell on it. But the hour is just here, knocking at the door, when we shall thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> not only for the long years of companionship and health and example which she has given us, but for this great relief: that, in fulness of time, in loving-kindness, He hath broken the bond which hindered her. No heaven that is not a home to her. She worked with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> here, and <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> He has taken her into His presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5403"/>We are sad because of the void at our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5404"/>It is hard to have the path so empty around us. We miss that face and those tones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5405"/>But that is the body; limited, narrow, of little faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5406"/>The soul shines through in a moment, sees its own destiny, and thanks <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the joyous change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5407"/>We draw sad breaths now. We miss the magnet that kept this home together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5408"/>We miss the tie that bound so lovingly into <num value="1">one</num> life so many lives; that is broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5409"/>We peer into the future, and fear for another void still, and a narrower circle, not knowing which of us will be taken next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5410"/>With an effort of patience &mdash; with half submission -we bow to <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> dealings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5411"/>That is only for an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5412"/>In a little while we shall remember the grand life; we shall thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the contribution it has made to the educating forces of the race, for the good it has been prompted to do, for the part it had strength to play in the grandest drama of our generation,--and then with our eyes lifted, and not dimmed by tears, we shall be able to say out of a full heart: <quote>Thou doest all things well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5413"/>Blessed be Thy name!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5414"/>Blessed be Thy name for the <num value="3">three</num> score overflowing years; for the sunny sky she was permitted finally to see, the hated name made immortal, the perilled life guarded by a nation's gratitude, for the capstone put on with shoutings; that she was privileged to enter the promised land and rest in the triumph, with the family circle unbroken, all she loved about her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>It has been well said that we are not here to weep, and neither are we here to praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>No life closes without sadness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>Death, after all, no matter what hope or what memories surround it, is terrible and a mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5420"/>We never part hands that have been clasped life-long in loving tenderness but the hour is sad; still, we do not come here to weep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5421"/>In other moments, elsewhere, we can offer tender and loving sympathy to those whose roof-tree is so sadly bereaved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5422"/>But in the spirit of the great life which we commemorate, this hour is for the utterance of a lesson; this hour is given to contemplate a grand example, a rich inheritance, a noble life worthily ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5423"/>You come together, not to pay tribute, even loving tribute, to the friend you have lost, whose features you will miss from daily life, but to remember the grand lesson of that career; to speak to each other, and to emphasize what that life teaches, especially in the hearing of these young listeners, who did not see that marvellous career,--in their hearing to construe the meaning of the great name which is borne world-wide, and tell them why on both sides of the ocean, the news of his death is a matter of interest to every lover of his race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5424"/>As my friend said, we have no right to be silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/>Those of us who stood near him, who witnessed the secret springs of his action, the consistent inward and <pb id="p.460" n="460"/> outward life, have no right to be silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5426"/>The largest contribution that will ever be made by any single man's life to the knowledge of the working of our institutions will be the picture of his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5427"/>He sounded the depths of the weakness, he proved the ultimate strength of republican institutions; he gave us to know the perils that confront us; he taught us to rally the strength that lies hid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5428"/>To my mind there are <num value="3">three</num> remarkable elements in his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/><num value="1">One</num> is rare even among great men. It was his own moral nature, unaided, uninfluenced from outside, that consecrated him to a great idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>Other men ripen gradually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5431"/>The youngest of the great American names that will be compared with his was between <num value="30">thirty</num> and <num value="40">forty</num> when his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Antislavery word was uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5432"/><persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName> was <measure n="34years" type="date">thirty-four years</measure> old when an infamous enterprise woke him to indignation, and it then took <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> more to reveal to him the mission <name n="God" type="God">God</name> designed for him. This man was in jail for his opinions when he was just <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5433"/>He had confronted a nation in the very bloom of his youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5434"/>It could be said of him more than of any other American in our day, and more than of any great leader that I chance now to remember in any epoch, that he did not need circumstances, outside influence, some great pregnant event, to press him into service, to provoke him to thought, to kindle him into enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5435"/>His moral nature was as marvellous as was the intellect of <persName><foreName>Pascal</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>It seemed to be born fully equipped, <quote>finely touched.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>Think of the mere dates; think that at some <measure n="24years" type="date">twenty-four years</measure> old, while Christianity and statesmanship, the experience, the genius of the land, were wandering in the desert, aghast, amazed, and confounded over a frightful evil, a great sin, this boy sounded, found, invented the talisman,--<quote>Immediate, unconditional emancipation on the soil.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/><pb id="p.461" n="461"/> You may say he borrowed it &mdash; true enough &mdash; from the lips of a woman on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>; but he was the only <rs>American</rs> whose moral nature seemed, just on the edge of life, so perfectly open to duty and truth that it answered to the far-off bugle-note, and proclaimed it instantly as a complete solution of the problem.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5439"/>Young men, you have no conception of the miracle of that insight; for it is not given to you to remember with any vividness the blackness of the darkness of ignorance and indifference which then brooded over what was called the moral and religious element of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5440"/>When I think of him, as <persName><foreName>Melanchthon</foreName></persName> said of <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>, <quote>day by day grows the wonder fresh</quote> at the ripeness of the moral and intellectual life that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave him at the very opening.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>You hear that boy's lips announcing the statesman-like solution which startled politicians and angered Church and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>A year afterwards, with equally single-hearted devotion, in words that have been so often quoted, with those dungeon doors behind him, he enters on his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5443"/>In <dateStruct value="1831-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, then <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> old, he starts the publication of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, advocating the immediate abolition of slavery; and with the sublime pledge, <quote>I will be as harsh as truth and as uncompromising as justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5444"/>On this subject I do not wish to speak or write with moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5445"/>I will not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not retreat a single inch; <emph>and I will be heard</emph>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>Then began an agitation which for the marvel of its origin, the majesty of its purpose, the earnestness, unselfishness, and ability of its appeals, the vigor of its assault, the deep national convulsion it caused, the vast and beneficent changes it wrought, and its wide-spread, indirect influence on all kindred moral question, is without <pb id="p.462" n="462"/> a parallel in history since <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>This boy created and marshalled it. His converts held it up and carried it on. Before this, all through the preceding century, there had been among us scattered and single Abolitionists, earnest and able men,--sometimes, like <persName n="Wythe,,,,," id="n0189.0034.00462.01411" reg="mostcommon:Wythe,nomatch:0"><surname>Wythe</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in high places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>The <rs>Quakers</rs> and Covenanters had never intermitted their testimony against slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>He announced the principle, arranged the method, gathered the forces, enkindled the zeal, started the argument, and finally marshalled the nation for and against the system in a conflict that came near rending the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>I marvel again at the instinctive sagacity which discerned the hidden forces fit for such a movement, called them forth, and wielded them to such prompt results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5455"/>Marvellous was their agitation; as you gaze upon it in its successive stages and analyze it, you are astonished at what they invented for tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5456"/>But this boy stood alone, utterly alone, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5457"/>There was no sympathy anywhere; his hands were empty; <num value="1">one</num> single penniless comrade was his only helper..

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>My friend <persName n="Weld,,,,," id="n0189.0034.00462.01416" reg="mostcommon:Weld,nomatch:0"><surname>Weld</surname></persName> has said the <rs type="place">Church</rs> was a thick bank of black cloud looming over him. Yes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5459"/>But no sooner did the <rs type="place">Church</rs> discern the impetuous boy's purpose than out <pb id="p.463" n="463"/> of that dead, sluggish cloud thundered and lightened a malignity which could not find words to express its hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>The very pulpit where I stand saw this apostle of liberty and justice sore beset, always in great need, and often in deadly peril; yet it never gave him <num value="1">one</num> word of approval or sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>During all his weary struggle, <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0189.0034.00463.01417" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> felt its weight in the scale against him. In those years it led the sect which arrogates to itself the name of Liberal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/>If this was the bearing of so-called Liberals, what bitterness of opposition, judge ye, did not the others show?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5463"/>A mere boy confronts Church, commerce, and college; a boy with neither training nor experience!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>Almost at once the assault tells; the whole country is hotly interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>What created such life under those ribs of death?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>Whence came that instinctive knowledge?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5467"/>Where did he get that sound common-sense?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>Whence did he summon that almost unerring sagacity which, starting agitation on an untried field, never committed an error, provoking year by year additional enthusiasm, gathering, as he advanced, helper after helper to his side!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/>I marvel at the miraculous boy. He had no means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>Where he got, whence he summoned, how he created, the elements which changed <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> into <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>,--<dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> apathy, indifference, ignorance, icebergs, into <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>, every man intelligently hating him, and mobs assaulting him in every city,--is a marvel which none but older men than I can adequately analyze and explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>He said to a friend who remonstrated with him on the heat and severity of his language, <quote><rs type="role2">Brother</rs>, I have need to be all on fire, for I have mountains of ice about me to melt.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>Well, that dungeon of <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, that universal apathy, that deadness of soul, that contempt of what called itself intellect, in <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> he changed into the whole country aflame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>He made every single home, press, pulpit, and senate-chamber a debating society, with <hi rend="italics">his</hi> right and <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> wrong for the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/>And as was said of <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>, <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> honored him by making all the worst men his enemies.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5475"/>Fastened on that daily life was a malignant attention and criticism such as no American has ever endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5476"/>I will not call it a criticism of hate; that word is not strong enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5477"/>Malignity searched him with candles from the moment he uttered that <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-given solution of the problem to the moment when he took the hand of the nation and wrote out the statute which made it law. Malignity searched those <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> with candles, and yet even malignity has never lisped a suspicion, much less a charge,--never lisped a suspicion of anything mean, dishonorable, dishonest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5478"/>No man, however mad with hate, however fierce in assault, ever dared to hint that there was anything low in motive, false in assertion, selfish in purpose, dishonest in method,--never a stain on the thought, the word, or the deed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5479"/>Now contemplate this boy entering such an arena, confronting a nation and all its forces, utterly poor, with no sympathy from any quarter, conducting an angry, wide-spread, and profound agitation for <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="20">twenty</num>, <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, amid the hate of everything strong in American life, and the contempt of everything influential, and no stain, not the slightest shadow of <num value="1">one</num>, rests on his escutcheon!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5481"/>Then look at the work he did. My friends have spoken of his influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5482"/>What American ever held his hand so long and so powerfully on the helm of social, intellectual, and moral America?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5483"/>There have been giants in our day. Great men, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has granted in widely <pb id="p.465" n="465"/> different spheres; earnest men, men whom public admiration lifted early into power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5484"/>I shall venture to name some of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5575"/>In an epoch fertile of great genius among women, it may be said of <persName n="Martineau,Miss,,,," id="n0189.0035.00473.01457" reg="nearbymention:Martineau,Harriet,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Martineau</surname></persName>, that she was the peer of the noblest, and that her influence on the progress of the age was more than equal <pb id="p.474" n="474"/> to that of all the others combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5576"/>She has the great honor of having always seen truth <num value="1">one</num> generation ahead; and so consistent was she, so keen of insight, that there is no need of going back to explain by circumstances in order to justify the actions of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5577"/>This can hardly be said of any great Englishman, even by his admirers.</p>

Her friends feared to tell her the truth when she asked what the immense crowd were doing, and dissimulated by saying it was post-time, and the throng were hurrying to the office for the mail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5580"/>Afterwards, when she heard of the mob and its action, horror-struck, she turned for an explanation to her host, the honored president of a neighboring university; and even he was American enough to assure her that no harm could come from such a gathering; said it was not a mob, it was a collection, or gathering.</p>
