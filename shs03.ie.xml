<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It is a common mistake of those who write on subjects familiar to themselves, to omit that particularity of description and detailed mention which,to <num value="1">one</num> not so conversant with the matters discussed, is necessary to a clear appreciation of the meaning of the writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>This mistake is all the more fatal when the writer lives and writes in <num value="1">one</num> age and his readers live in another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>And so a soldier, writing for the information of the citizen, should forget his familiarity with the every-day scenes of soldier life and strive to record even those things which seem to him too common to mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Who does not know all about the marching of soldiers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Those who have never marched with them and some who have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The varied experience of <num value="1000">thousands</num> would not tell the whole story of the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Every man must be heard before the <pb id="p.14" n="14"/>story is told, and even then the part of those who fell by the way is wanting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Orders to move!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Where? when? what for?--are the eager questions of the men as they begin their preparations to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Generally nobody can answer, and the journey is commenced in utter ignorance of where it is to end. But shrewd guesses are made, and scraps of information will be picked up on the way. The main thought must be to <quote>get ready to move.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The orderly sergeant is shouting <quote>fall in,</quote> and there is no time to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The probability is that before you get your blanket rolled up, find your frying pan, haversack, axe, &amp;c., and <quote>fall in,</quote> the roll-call will be over, and some <quote>extra duty</quote> provided.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>No wonder there is bustle in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Rapid decisions are to be made between the various conveniences which have accumulated, for some must be left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/><num value="1">One</num> fellow picks up the skillet, holds it awhile, mentally determining how much it weighs, and what will be the weight of it after carrying it <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, and reluctantly, with <num value="0.5">a half</num>-ashamed, sly look, drops it and takes his place in ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Another having added to his store of blankets too freely, now has to decide which of the <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> he will leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The old water-bucket looks large and heavy, but <num value="1">one</num> stout-hearted, strong-armed man has taken it affectionately to his care.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>This is the time to say farewell to the bread-tray, farewell to the little piles of clean straw laid between <num value="2">two</num> logs, where it was so easy to sleep; farewell to those piles of wood, cut with so much labor; farewell to the girls in the neighborhood; farewell to the spring, farewell to <quote>our tree</quote> and <quote>our fire,</quote> good-bye to the fellows who are not going, and a general good-bye to the very hills and valleys.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Soldiers commonly threw away the most valuable articles they possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Blankets, overcoats, shoes, bread and meat,--all gave way to the necessities of the march; and what <num value="1">one</num> man threw away would frequently be the very article another wanted and would immediately pick up. So there was not much lost after all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hour or so of the march was generally quite orderly &mdash; the men preserving their places in ranks and marching with a good show of order; but soon some lively fellow whistles an air, somebody else starts a song, the whole column breaks out with roars of laughter, <quote>route step</quote> takes the place of order, and the jolly singing, laughing, talking and joking that follows none could describe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Now let any young officer dare to pass along who sports a new <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>hat, coat, saddle, or anything new, or odd, or fine, and how nicely he is attended to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The expressions of good-natured fun, or contempt, which <num value="1">one</num> regiment of infantry was capable of uttering in a day for the benefit of passers by, would fill a volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>As <num value="1">one</num> thing or another in the dress of the <quote>subject</quote> of their remarks attracted attention they would shout, <quote>Come out of that hat!!--you can't hide in thar!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/><quote>Come out of that coat, come out &mdash; there's a man it it!!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/><quote>Come out of them boots!!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The infantry seemed to know exactly what to say to torment cavalry and artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> on the roadside was simple enough to recognize and address by name a man in the ranks, the whole column would kindly respond, and add all sorts of pleasant remarks, such as, <quote>Halloa, <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>, here's your brother!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/><quote>Bill!! Oh bill!!!I here's your ma!</quote>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Troops on the march were generally so cheerful and gay that an outsider looking on them as they marched would hardly imagine how they suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>In summer time, the dust, combined with the heat, caused great suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The nostrils of the men, filled with dust, became dry and feverish,and even the throat did not escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The <quote>grit</quote> was felt between the teeth, and the eyes were rendered almost useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>There was dust in eyes, mouth, ears and hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The shoes were full of sand, and penetrating the clothes, and getting in at the neck, wrists and ankles, the dust, mixed with perspiration, produced an irritant almost as active as cantharides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The heat was at times terrific, but the men became greatly accustomed to it, and endured it with wonderful ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Their heavy woollen clothes were a great annoyance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Tough linen or cotton clothes would have been a great relief; indeed, there are many objections to woollen clothing for soldiers even in winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The sun produced great changes in the appearance of the men. Their skins were tanned to a dark brown or red, their hands black almost, and, added to this the long, uncut beard and hair, they too burned to a strange color, made them barely recognizable to the homefolks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>If the dust and the heat were not on hand to annoy, their very able substitutes were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Mud, cold, rain, snow, hail and wind took their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Rain was the greatest discomfort a soldier could have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It was more uncomfortable than the severest cold with clear weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Wet clothes, shoes and blankets; wet meat and bread; wet feet and wet ground; wet wood to burn, or, rather, not to burn; <pb id="p.16" n="16"/>wet arms and ammunition; wet ground to sleep on, mud to wade through, swollen creeks to ford, muddy springs, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other discomforts attended the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>There was no comfort on a rainy day or night except in <quote>bed</quote> --that is, under your blanket and oilcloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Cold winds, blowing the rain in the faces of the men, increased the discomfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Mud was often so deep as to submerge the horses and mules, and at times it was necessary for <num value="1">one</num> man or more to extricate another from the mud holes in the road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Marching at night, when very dark, was attended with additional discomforts and dangers, such as falling off bridges, stumbling into ditches, tearing the face and injuring the eyes against the bushes and projecting limbs of trees, and getting separated from your own company and hopelessly lost in the multitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Of course, a man lost had no sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>If he dared to ask a question, every man in hearing would answer, each differently, and then the whole multitude would roar with laughter at the lost man, and ask him <quote>if his mother knew he was out?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Very few men had comfortable or fitting shoes, and less had socks, and, as a consequence, the suffering from bruised and inflamed feet was terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It was a common practice, on long marches, for the men to take off their shoes and carry them in their hands or swung over their shoulder.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>When large bodies of troops were moving on the same road the alternate <quote>halt</quote> and <quote>forward</quote> was very harassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Every obstacle produced a halt and caused the men at once to sit and lie down on the road-side where shade or grass tempted them, and about the time they got fixed they would hear the word <quote>forward!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>and then have to move at increased speed to close up the gap in the column.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Sitting down for a few minutes on a long march is pleasant, but it does not always pay. When the march is resumed the limbs are stiff and sore, and the man rather worsted by the rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>About noon on a hot day, some fellow with the water instinct would determine in his own mind that a well was not far ahead, and start off in a trot to reach it before the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Of course another followed and another, till a stream of men were hurrying to the well, which was soon completely surrounded by a thirsty mob, yelling and pushing and pulling to get to the bucket as the windlass brought it again and again to the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Impatience and haste soon overturn the windlass, spatter the water all around the <pb id="p.17" n="17"/>well till the whole crowd is wading in mud, and now the rope is broken and the bucket falls to the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>But there is a substitute for rope and bucket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The men hasten away and get long, slim poles, and on them tie, by their straps, a number of canteens, which they lower into the well and fill, and, unless, as was frequently the case, the whole lot slipped off and fell to the bottom, drew them to the top and distributed them to their owners, who at once threw their heads back, inserted the nozzles in their mouths and drank the last drop, hastening at once to rejoin the marching column, leaving behind them a dismantled and dry well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>It was in vain the officers tried to stop the stream making for the water, and equally vain to attempt to move the crowd while a drop remained accessible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Many who were thoughtful carried full canteens to comrades in the column who had not been able to get to the well, and no <num value="1">one</num> who has not had experience of it knows the thrill of gratification and delight which those fellows knew when the cool stream gurgled from the battered canteen down their parched throats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>In very hot weather, when the necessities of the service allowed it, there was a halt about noon, of an hour or so, to rest the men and give them a chance to cool off and get the sand and gravel out of their shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>This time was spent by some in absolute repose &mdash; but the lively boys told many a yarn, cracked many a joke, and sung many a song between <quote>halt</quote> and <quote>column forward!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Some took the opportunity, if water was near, to bathe their feet, hands and face, and nothing could be more enjoyable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The passage of a cider cart (a barrel on wheels) was a rare and exciting occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The rapidity with which a barrel of sweet cider was consumed would astonish any <num value="1">one</num> who saw it for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, and generally the owner had cause to wonder at the small return in cash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Sometimes a desperately enterprising darkey would approach the column with a cart load of pies <quote>so called.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It would be impossible to describe accurately the taste or appearance of these pies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>They were generally similar in appearance, size and thickness to a pale specimen of <quote>Old Virginia</quote> <rs n="buckwheat cakes" type="product">buckwheat cakes</rs>, and had a taste which resembled a combination of rancid lard and crab apples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It was generally supposed that they contained dried apples, and the sellers were careful to state that they had <quote>sugar in &lsquo;em,</quote> and <quote>was mighty nice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It was rarely the case that any <quote>trace</quote> of sugar was found, but they filled up a hungry man wonderfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/><pb id="p.18" n="18"/></p> 
<p>Men of sense, and there were many such in the ranks, were necessarily desirous of knowing where or how far they were to march, and suffered greatly from a feeling of helpless ignorance of where they were and whither bound &mdash; whether to battle or camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Frequently, when anticipating the quiet and rest of an ideal camp, they were thrown, weary and exhausted, into the face of a waiting enemy, and at times, after anticipating a sharp fight, having formed line of battle and braced themselves for the coming danger, suffered all the apprehension and gotten themselves in good fighting trim, they would be marched off in the dryest and prosiest sort of style and ordered into camp, where, in all probability, they had to <quote>wait for the wagon,</quote> and for the bread and meat therein, until the proverb, <quote>Patient waiting is no loss,</quote> lost all its force and beauty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Occasionally, when the column extended for a mile or more, and the road was <num value="1">one</num> dense moving mass of men, a cheer would be heard away ahead and increasing in volume as it approached until there was <num value="1">one</num> universal shout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Then some general favorite officer would dash by, followed by his staff, and explain the cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>At other times, the same cheering and enthusiasm would result from the passage down the column of some obscure and despised officer, who knew it was all a joke, and looked mean and sheepish accordingly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The men would generally help each other in real distress, but their delight was to torment any <num value="1">one</num> who was unfortunate in a ridiculous way. If, for instance, a piece of artillery was fast in the mud, the infantry and cavalry passing around the obstruction would rack their brains for words and phrases applicable to the situation and most calculated to worry the cannoniers who, waist deep in the mud, are tugging at the wheels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Brass bands, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quite numerous and good, became very rare and the music very poor in the latter years of the war. It was a fine thing to see the fellows trying to keep the music going as they waded through the mud. But poor as the music was, it helped the footsore and weary to make another mile, and encouraged a cheer and a brisker step from the lagging and tired column.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>As the men became tired, there was less and less talking, until the whole mass became quiet and serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Each man was occupied with his own thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>For miles nothing could be heard but the steady tramp of the men, the rattling and jingling of canteens and accoutrements, and the occasional <quote>close up, men,--close up!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>of the officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Dear sir &mdash; Your letter I received some time ago, and would have answered it earlier, but was prevented by unforseen circumstances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>You desire to know the details of the fight at <placeName reg="Fort Gregg">Fort Gregg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>I think it due to the men of that noble old brigade, which stood the contest from <placeName key="tgn,7014197" n="1.000 27" reg="new bern, craven, north carolina">Newberne</placeName> to the surrender, that some true lover of patriotism and valor should espouse their cause, and place them <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to none among the true defenders of that memorable fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>History does not reveal names more deserving of honor and praise than those of that detachment which I had the honor to command, and my mind painfully reverts to the agonizing adieu of each hero as he closed his eyes in death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>I cannot speak positively when I attempt to give the number of men belonging to your brigade or the miscellaneous commands in the fort, but I speak confidently when I say that at least <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> were of your brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>I think I had between <num value="75">seventy-five</num> and <num value="80">eighty</num> men all told, with <persName n="Craige,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0118.0004.00023.00172" reg="nearbymention:Craige,F.,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenants</roleName> <surname>Craige</surname></persName> and <persName n="Howard,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0118.0004.00023.00173" reg="nearbymention:Howard,A.,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant"></roleName><surname>Howard</surname></persName>, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> other officers whose names I do not recollect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The artillerists fought bravely, resorting to small arms after being unable to. use their cannon, and <pb id="p.24" n="24"/>appeared to me as if commanding themselves: they were of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Chew,Captain,,,," id="n0118.0004.00024.00175" reg="mostcommon:Chew,W.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Chew</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Our stubborn resistance is due to your foresight in supplying the fort with cartridges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The enemy charged us <num value="3">three</num> times, and after having expended all our ammunition, rocks were used successfully for over half an hour in resisting their repeated attempts to rush over us. While I would most willingly accord to each man within the fort his just and proper credit, yet I do not think that <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Harris,,,,," id="n0118.0004.00024.00176" reg="mostcommon:Harris,Thomas,W.,,:2"><surname>Harris</surname></persName>' brigade</orgName> should be mentioned in connection with its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>I cannot point out a single instance where <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0118.0004.00024.00177" reg="nearbymention:Lane,James,H.,,"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> failed to perform his duty on that day. The position we occupied (the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> and centre) were the only parts attacked without <num value="1">one</num> moment's interval of peace, and we repulsed with great loss an attack in the rear which would have otherwise necessitated our surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>It embraced the military operations to that date.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>After the reduction of <placeName reg="Gaines Crossroads, Greenwood, South Carolina" key="tgn,2343395">Gaines</placeName>, I felt confident that the whole naval and land force of the enemy would be brought against <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0118.0006.00038.00318" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,R.,C.,,:2"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, and was assiduous in preparing my fort for as good a defence as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>For the state of the work I beg leave to refer <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>you to <persName n="Sheliha,Chief-Engineer,,,," id="n0118.0006.00039.00319" reg="mostcommon:Sheliha,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Engineer">Chief Engineer</roleName> <surname>Sheliha</surname></persName>'s letter to Headquarters' Department, of <dateStruct value="-07-9"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct>, from which time no material change or addition was made; and further to state, that it had been demonstrated by the fire from the enemy that the enceinte of the fort (in which was its main strength) protected the scarp of the main wall only about <num value="0.5">one-half</num> its height from curbated shot; that it was now in the power of the enemy to open fire from every point of the compass, and consequently none of the casemates, without heavy traverses in their front, would be safe; that it was manifest, by this concentration of fire, my heavy guns could soon be dismounted; and my making a protracted resistance depended on my ability to protect my men from the heavy fire, and hold the fort from the flank casemates against an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>With these views, I employed my men day and night, most of the time under fire, in erecting traverses to protect my guns on the main wall as long as possible, to render the casemate selected for the sick and wounded secure, and to provide safe quarters for themselves in their rest from the arduous duties they would have to endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>It was necessary also to put a large traverse at the <rs>Sally Port</rs>, which was entirely exposed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>During this time a pretty continuous fire was kept up on the fort from the <name>Parrott</name> guns in several batteries erected by the enemy; and in the intervals of serving the guns my men were engaged in the work before mentioned, for their protection, in the anticipation of a vigorous bombardment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>The sharpshooters in our front had become very numerous and active, and with these encircling us on the land, and the fire delivered from the fleet on the flanks, our guns had to be served with much care and under great difficulty.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The land forces of the enemy completed their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach (see accompanying sketch) on the <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num> and <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> across the peninsula; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> through the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> and <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num>; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, a bayou, near and parallel to gulf shore, <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> and <num value="14" type="ordinal">14th</num>; their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parallel <num value="500">500</num> and <measure n="700yards" type="distance">700 yards distant</measure>, <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>, <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>, <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num>, <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num>, <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num>; approaches on <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> and <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> to within <measure n="200yards" type="distance">200 yards</measure> of our glacis.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Such guns as I could use on this force I annoyed them with, especially at night, and to the extent possible retarded their work; <pb id="p.41" n="41"/>though nothing very effective could be accomplished in this way, as their working parties were well concealed in the sand hills, and when our fire was concentrated on any <num value="1">one</num> point they would merely, unseen, remove to some other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>To the morning of the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, our efforts were with the heavy guns that bore on them to interfere with the investing approaches of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>The topography of our front, however, was to their advantage, and they made a steady advance, covering it somewhat with an irregular fire from the batteries already in position, and lining their works already completed with sharpshooters to pick off our gunners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>At dayligth the fleet was reported moving up to encircle us, and shortly its batteries (in conjunction with those on land which numbered <num value="36">thirty-six</num> (<num value="36">36</num>) guns and mortars) opened a furious fire, which came from almost every point of the compass, and continued unabated throughout the day, culminating in increased force at sundown; after which the heavy calibres and mortars kept it up during the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>This fire disabled all the heavy guns, save <num value="2">two</num>, which did not bear on the land approach, partially breached the walls in several places, and cut up the fort to such extent as to make the whole work a mere mass of debris.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Their mortar practice was accurate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Apprehensive from the great effect already had on the walls, that my magazines, containing now <measure n="80000l." type="pounds"><num value="80000">80,000</num> pounds</measure>, were in danger in continuation of the bombardment in the night, with great care and under continuous fire I had the powder brought out and flooded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>The guns in the <quote>Water</quote> and <quote>Lunette</quote> batteries, now unserviceable and in jeopardy from the enemy, I ordered spiked and otherwise effectually damaged; and all the guns on the main rampart dismounted by the fire from the enemy were likewise destroyed, as of no further avail in defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Early in the night the woodwork of the citadel was fired by the mortar shells, and burned furiously for some hours; the enemy during the conflagration pouring in his missiles with increased vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>With great efforts the fire was arrested, and prevented extending around near the magazines, which would have been in imminent danger of explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>The enemy's approach was very near the glacis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>My guns and powder had all been destroyed; my <quote>means of defence gone;</quote> the citadel, nearly the entire quartermaster store and a portion of the commissariat burnt by the enemy's shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>It was evident the fort could hold out but a few hours longer under a renewed bombardment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The only question was, hold it for this time, gain the eclat and sustain the loss of life from the falling of the walls, or save life and capitulate?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>I capitulated to the enemy at <time value="2pm">2 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>This was not done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The <quote>pen,</quote> as our quarters are called, embraces an area of near <measure n="2acres" type="area">two acres</measure>. The building, a mere shell, unceiled and unplastered, is on <num value="3">three</num> sides, with a high, close plank fence on the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> side, separating us from the privates' barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The long side of the building (barracks, as it is called), parallel with the fence, is about <measure n="300feet" type="distance">300 feet</measure> in length, running <name>east</name> and <name>west</name>, and the other <num value="2">two</num> sides or ends are each about <measure n="150feet" type="distance">150 feet</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The campus or exercise ground is low and flat,wet and muddy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>There are narrow plank walks, intersecting each other, and near the building, which are thronged with passing crowds this wet weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The bunks or berths in each division are <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> long and about <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> apart, extending entirely across the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Each division is heated by <num value="1">one</num> large upright stove, which the prisoners keep very hot when sufficient coal can be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The room is so open and cold, however, that <num value="0.5">a half</num>-dozen or more stoves would be required to heat it. Several poor fellows, who have no bunk-mates and a scarcity of covering, sit up around the stoves and nod all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>It is a long, dark room, having a long pine table, on which the food is placed in separate piles, either on a tin plate or on the uncovered, greasy table, at meal hours, twice a day. No knives nor forks, nor spoons are furnished.

The fare consists of a slice of baker's bread, very often stale, with weak coffee, for breakfast, and a slice of bread and piece of salt pork or salt beef, sometimes, alternating with boiled fresh beef and bean soup, for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The beef is often tough and hard to masticate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It is said to be thrown, bloody and unwashed, in huge pots, filled with water of doubtful cleanliness, and boiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Many prisoners club together and form messes, and with such money as they receive from Northern friends, or as they can make by their own ingenious work, buy such eatables as can be obtained from the sutler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The prison allowance is poor and scant indeed, and I eagerly consume all I receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>As a corps commander, I regarded the morale of the army greatly impaired after the fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, and in fact before its fall the troops were not by any means in good spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It was my observation and belief that the majority of the officers and men were so impressed with the idea of their inability to carry even temporary breastworks, that when orders were given for attack, and there was a probability of encountering works, they regarded it as recklessness in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Beingimpressed with these convictions, they did not generally move to the attack with that spirit which nearly always insures success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Whenever the enemy changed his position, temporary works could be improvised in less than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, and he could never be caught without them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>In making these observations, it is due to many gallant officers and commands to state that there were noticeable exceptions, but the feeling was so General that anything like a general attack was paralyzed by it. The army having constantly yielded to the flank movements of The enemy, which he could make with but little difficulty, by reason of his vastly superior numbers, and having failed in the offensive movements prior to the fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, its efficiency for further retarding the progress of the enemy was much impaired; and, besides, the advantages in the topography of the country south of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> were much more favorable to the enemy for the movements of his superior numbers than the rough and mountainous country already yielded to him. In view of these facts, it was my <pb id="p.65" n="65"/>opinion that the army should take up the offensive, with the hope that favorable opportunities would be offered for striking the enemy successfully, thus insuring the efficiency of the army for future operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>Directly thereafter I heard the clatter of horses' feet, and on going to the parlor window saw the head of the invading force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>The horses were in a walk, and no dash whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>I looked for some moments before I realized that they were indeed Federal soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>The invading party could learn at <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName> all they wanted to know, and I have not a doubt that when they crossed the river they were under the impression that only <num value="1">one</num> company of cavalry occupied the town.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>This new work is very ambitious in size, grasp and treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>It is a bust-portrait, the head being somewhat larger than life, and the chest being represented below the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>Although the scale is so large, there is none of his works in which this master of pure line has shown more care and intelligence in representing, by well chosen strokes, the richness and transparency of complexion, the variety of textures, the filmy lightness of hair and beard, the fullness of stuffs, and the general sense of enveloping air, all of which combine to give quality to a portrait.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>The face, turned somewhat to the spectator's right, represents <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0118.0017.00092.00822" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> in the hale strength of middle age, with the eagle force of the eyes slightly veiled by the influence of time and experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>As in the record of his life the vicissitudes of history only taught this grand man a calm and equable dignity, so in the portrait it is the endurance, fortitude and unconquerable nobility of character which are made emphatic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>The active and aggressive traits are held in check by a sense of superior wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>If ever the expression of a modern face deserved to be called Olympian, it is the countenance delineated in this remarkable print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>Seldom has an engraver given such liquid depth to a large, grand eye. It looks out straight to the horizon, with a comprehensive glance of ineffable manliness, repose, and natural command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>It shows the courage to act, and also the courage to bear and to wait.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>The fine, waving, grizzled hair and beard, which gave to <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0118.0017.00092.00823" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> the soldierly comeliness of some noble old moustache of the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, are treated by <persName n="Marshall,Mister,,,," id="n0118.0017.00092.00824" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,William,Edgar,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName> with a felicity that only his long experience with the burin could inspire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>The light waved lines express, at the proper distance, the exact character of dry, soft, silky, aged hair, which lifts easily on every breeze, and always allows the conformation of the cranium and the muscular anatomy of the face to be distinctly divined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>The grand and thought-worn forehead, the firm mouth, and the general monumental and strong character of the face are well understood and rendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>Few heroes have had so pure and heroic a type of face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>The engraver understands his work so well as to leave on the beholder's mind an impression of magnificent manhood, of vast resources of energy, and finally of self-communing, self-respecting calm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>The dress indicated is the old working uniform of warlike days &mdash; the suit <num value="3">three</num> small stars on the collar, the waistcoat carelessly <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>opened, and the white shirt stiffly tied at the neck with black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Although this uniform, however, indicates a definite historical period, we cannot help seeing in the air of the majestic face a something which that particular uniform never accompanied &mdash; the accomplished work of life, the chastening and visionary sadness of a Lost Cause, the grandeur of self-repression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>By this happy inconsistency, this <hi rend="italics">ben trovato</hi> anachronism, we conceive the engraver to wish to include the whole record of a great career, and to combine at once the characteristics of the time of effort and the time of retrospection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>The technical quality of this head is throughout peculiarly good: seldom has pure line given as good a suggestion of the painter's carnation and gray and silver and warm shadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>Every plane of the modeling, every variation of tint in a rich blood-chased complexion is keenly followed by the change of line, and subtly interpreted to the eye. The mere technical inventiveness of this large print is a lesson to the line-engraver.</p></quote> <milestone unit="hr"/> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>Sir &mdash; In pursuance of your suggestion, I have the honor to report, from the best accessible data, the closing operations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> commissary service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>As you are probably aware, many of the more important papers of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs> were lost during the <rs>Richmond</rs> fire and the subsequent retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>It accordingly became essential to verify in the most careful manner all statements herein resting simply upon personal recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>This has been done; and hence the time which has been allowed to pass since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation of your wishes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1865-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, I received the order of transfer from the direction of the <name>Nitre</name> and Mining Corps to that of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>A very brief inquiry into the available resources of the latter sufficed to disclose a state of affairs calling for extreme and indeed exceptional measures to meet immediate and very urgent requisitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>The more remote future I found too critically involved in the military operations, then progressing in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>Carolinas</name>, to require more than general consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>Beyond the most trusted confidential officers of the <rs>Executive</rs> and the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, few knew how far military events and hostile pressure had come to control the power of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs> to execute its ordinary duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>I expected to find greater embarrassments in arranging a prompt and ample collection of supplies <pb id="p.98" n="98"/>for the <rs>Southern</rs> armies, from the depreciated currency, the failing condition of the railroads and the general exhaustion of the country; but difficulties still more serious lay elswhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>In every military department, and in the several districts of supply (which I examined), after the fullest allowance for all local obstacles, and all possible official shortcomings, the military status was still found to be the real measure of the ability of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs> to collect at that time the required supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>Cavalry raids, which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> only occasionally cut the more important lines of communication, had penetrated at the close of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> into the interior districts and had become very destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>Travel and the movement of supplies were in several important instances (as officially reported to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>) suspended for days at a time on every leading railroad within our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>Upon some of these roads communications were only restored with great difficulty, and on <num value="1">one</num> important trunk line not at all. Interior depots of supplies previously deemed secure against all risk, were frequently captured and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>Several of the more productive districts of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <name>Carolinas</name>, which were relied upon for certain supply in last resort, had passed permanently into hostile occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>All the remaining districts of supply (in <dateStruct value="1865-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>) were either directly menaced, or remotely disturbed by military preparations and movements for what proved to be our closing struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Under these depressing circumstances, I found the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName> with difficulty supplied day by day with reduced rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>In the other military departments, however, the situation was better; and from several it was still possible to draw a considerable surplus for the <rs type="place">Richmond</rs> and <placeName reg="Petersburg depot">Petersburg depots</placeName>, whenever transportation could be procured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>After a brief survey of the work to be done and of our remaining resources as before referred to, I at once proceeded to organize a system of appeal and of private contribution as auxiliary to the regular operations of the commissary service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>With the earnest and very active aid of leading citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, this effort was attended with results exceeding expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Calls were made upon the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> in person, and the officers in charge of the corn and forage supply for combined action; and these calls were met to the extreme limit of their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>Requisitions were also made upon the reserve stores of the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>, which my successor (in hearty cooperation) arranged to meet without detriment to his own service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/><pb id="p.99" n="99"/>Still further to increase receipts of meat and other supplies from beyond the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines, requisitions for coin were approved by the <rs>President</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and were met as called for by the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>It would be an omission not to add in this direct connection that all aid and support possible under the circumstances were rendered to the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs> by his superior and associate officers, and especially by the old corps of his predecessor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>With these combined agencies, it was found practicable during the ensuing <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> to materially improve the collection of supplies for the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> and in part for their delivery: sufficiently so to become the subject of special note in the correspondence of the <rs>General Commanding</rs> (<persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00099.00908" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>) with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, to which reference is made in the appended letter of the late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> (<persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00099.00909" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>In addition, there were considerable supplies of tea, coffee and sugar carefully reserved for hospital issues chiefly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> and his officers were also officially advised as occasion required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>It is hardly necessary to add that every possible effort was made to secure from the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster Department</orgName> prompt transportation from the railroad depots to the front; but the officers of that Department, owing to the rapid deterioration and, in many cases, the absolute failure of the motive power of the railroads, were unable to forward the collected supplies as fast as they were brought into depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>After every effort to move had been exhausted, the supplies not transported were placed in temporary sub-depots to await events.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1865-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, the questions arising out of the status thus set forth were carefully considered in a conference between the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> (<persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00100.00912" reg="nearbymention:Breckinridge,John,C.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>) and the <rs>General Commanding</rs> (<persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00100.00913" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>), to which the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> (<persName n="Lawton,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00100.00914" reg="mostcommon:Lawton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lawton</surname></persName>) and the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs> were called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>After a general discussion of the army wants in clothing, forage and subsistence, the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs>, in reply to the inquiry of the <rs>General Commanding</rs>, stated that a daily delivery by cars and canal boat, at or near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, of about <num value="500">five hundred</num> tons of commissary stores was essential to provide for the <rs>Richmond</rs> siege reserve and other accumulations desired by the <rs>General Commanding</rs>; that the depot collections were already sufficient to assure the meeting of these requisitions, and if the then existing military lines could be held, the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs> felt encouraged as to the future of his own immediate Department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>Upon the question of railroad transportation, the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster-General</rs> then stated that the rolling stock at command, and especially the engines, had become so much worn and otherwise deficient, and without means or provision for renewal, that the daily delivery in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> of <num value="500">five hundred</num> tons of commissary stores in addition to other requirements of the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs> and the demands of the resident population, could not be guaranteed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>He engaged, however, to make every possible effort to secure from the railroad <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>companies the desired improvement in the condition of their rolling stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>These efforts were made; but at that late period of exhaustion the situation had passed all human power to amend.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs> next submitted the question of military protection of stores in transit; but the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> in reply dwelt upon the increasing military pressure upon his lines and his own diminishing forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>All that remained to be done was to fill every accessible army wagon; and this was done, and the trains were hurried southward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>This difference has evidently been caused by reports to the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> prior to the latest movements before the evacuation of the city, and I feel fully assured in reiterating my statement that I controlled the quantity claimed; and more, that I had under my eye stores put away by speculators and hoarders that could have been gathered in short time, and had been permitted to remain undisturbed until necessity demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>I distributed a large number of rations on the day and night of the evacuation to every demand from army sources, to many of the citizens, and then, with the pressure of the evacuation, the supplies were taken possession of by the crowd.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>No order was received by me, and (with full opportunities of information if it had been given) I have no knowledge of any plan to send supplies to <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName>. <pb id="p.107" n="107"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>Dear General &mdash; My absence from home for a month, and the consequent accumulation of business, imposes on me the necessity of making but a brief and hurried answer to your inquiries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>Had I the time it would give me pleasure to give you, as desired, a full statement of the organization and working of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs>, and its condition when you were appointed <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs> in <dateStruct value="1865-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>I have read with care your statement to <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0118.0018.00107.00955" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> of the operations of the <rs type="place">Subsistence Bureau</rs> during the dark and closing days of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, when you were the chief of that Bureau, and so far as I was cognizant of them, or was at the time informed, I think the statement entirely correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>I was <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Commissary">Chief Commissary</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, with the rank of <rs type="role2">Major</rs> and Commissary, was stationed in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, with my office in the same building with that of the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs>, and was in close association with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/><pb id="p.108" n="108"/></p> 
<p>Each State had its chief commissary; was laid off in divisions, with an officer in each, and the <hi rend="italics">divisions</hi> subdivided, with agents in each of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>All these officers had the authority to impress supplies; and with this power and the money which was furnished them without stint, all supplies which could be spared from the support of the non-combatants were obtained for the use of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The accumulations at the supply depots were regularly reported by the subordinate officers to the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Commissary">Chief Commissary</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>, and by him to the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs>, who, either by general or special order, directed their disposition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>I recollect well when you took charge of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, that our condition was almost desperate, not because our supplies were exhausted (though exhaustion at a not remote future was looked to and seriously apprehended), but because our transportation from points where supplies were accumulated had almost entirely failed us. All the railroads were in bad condition, and several of the most important ones had been so damaged by the enemy's cavalry as to be unavailing for the transportation of supplies for weeks at a time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>Your action was prompt, energetic and efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>Your appeal for temporary aid from private resources was nobly responded to by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>The damaged roads were speedily repaired, and very soon we felt, as I well recollect, in a comparatively comfortable condition; and thus we continued until the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>I have no means of stating the quantities of supplies on hand at my several depots at or about that time, for all my official papers were burned, but I know that in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName>, &amp;c., the accumulations were large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>I never heard of any order for the accumulation of supplies at <placeName reg="Amelia Springs, Amelia, Virginia" key="tgn,2131946">Amelia Springs</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>If such order was given it must have been after the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was determined on, and when railroad transportation could not be had; prior to that time such order could readily have been complied with.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>While you filled the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs></orgName>, and during your predecessor's administration of that Department, I was president and in charge of the <orgName n="Richmond and Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Danville railroad</orgName> and the <orgName n="Piedmont Railroad" type="railroad">Piedmont railroad</orgName>, and conversant (except for a short interval) with many matters connected with the commissariat at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>My relations with <num value="2">two</num> of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretaries of War</rs> and with <persName n="Northrup,Colonel,,,," id="n0118.0018.00109.00961" reg="mostcommon:Northrup,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Northrup</surname></persName>, as well as the principal officers of his Department, were numerous, and frequently confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>I had official as well as personal relations with them at all times, and their views and actions on the subject of transportation were frequently communicated to me. I was familiar with the wants of the <rs>Government</rs>, and when the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was selected as the <rs>Capital</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, I was consulted as to the best plan for systematising the transportation over all the railroad lines within its limits; and being president of the <rs>Richmond</rs> and <rs>Danville</rs> and <placeName reg="Piedmont, Augusta, Virginia" key="tgn,2113636">Piedmont</placeName> railroads, some times the only ones open to the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, great responsibility was devolved on me. The difficulties of obtaining supplies were very great, particularly when the roads under my charge were cut and transportation suspended on them, which was the case upon <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> occasions for several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>Engines and cars and machinery generally on these roads were insufficient and inadequate from wear and tear, to accomplish the amount of transportation required by the <rs>Government</rs>, barely sufficient to meet the daily wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>Every other route for obtaining supplies outside of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> was closed long before the surrender, but after you entered on the discharge of the duties of <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs>, the <rs>Richmond</rs> and <rs>Danville</rs> and <placeName reg="Piedmont, Augusta, Virginia" key="tgn,2113636">Piedmont</placeName> railroads were kept open, and about that time we added largely to its rolling stock, by procuring engines and cars from the different roads on the route of the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee railroad</orgName> west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>Starvation had stared the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> in the face; and the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName> organized an appeal to the people on the line of the <orgName n="Richmond and Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Danville railroad</orgName> for voluntary contributions of supplies, and a number of gentlemen of influence, character and <pb id="p.110" n="110"/>position, including the most eminent clergymen of the <rs>State</rs>, addressed them in several counties, urging them to furnish the supply wanted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who witnessed can ever forget the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>Contribution was universal, and, supplies of food, sufficient to meet the wants of the army at the time, were at once sent to the depots on the road, until they were packed and groaned under their weight; and I affirm that at the time of the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the difficulty of delivering supplies sufficient for the support of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> under <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00110.00962" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was solved and surmounted, for I know that abundant supplies were in reach of transportation on the <orgName n="Richmond and Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Danville railroad</orgName>, being massed in <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte</placeName>, and at other points; and from the increased motive power above referred to, they could have been delivered as fast as they were required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>Moreover, sufficient means &mdash; not in Confederate currency, but in <hi rend="italics">specie</hi>--just before the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, had been furnished me by <persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n0118.0018.00110.00963" reg="mostcommon:Trenholm,George,Alfred,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, to meet the exigency and pay all pressing demands on the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>No orders were ever given to any officers or employee of the <orgName n="Richmond and Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Danville railroad</orgName> to transport any supplies to <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName> for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0018.00110.00964" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, nor did I ever hear that any such orders were sent to the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName> on the occasion of the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, until after the surrender of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>Being assured that there was no reason to apprehend an evacuation of the city, I <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>went on that evening to my home in <placeName reg="Amelia Court House, Amelia, Virginia" key="tgn,2110319">Amelia</placeName>, and returned next day, upon being informed by telegraph of the proposed evacuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>The term <quote>cavalry,</quote> in common parlance, includes all mounted troops, but in military phrase <quote>dragoons,</quote> <quote>mounted rifles</quote> and <quote>cavalry</quote> originally constituted different arms of the service, because <pb id="p.141" n="141"/>they were armed differently &mdash; dragoons, with muskets and sabres, to serve on foot or on horseback, as occasion might require; mounted riflemen, with rifles, to move on horseback with celerity, but really to serve on foot in action; and cavalry, with sabres and pistols &mdash; or short carbines &mdash; to serve on horseback in action and in the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Such was the case when the <num value="2">two</num> regiments of dragoons, the mounted rifle regiment and the <num value="2">two</num> cavalry regiments were respectively organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>The modern improvements in firearms, and especially the introduction of breech-loaders, have rendered useless the distinction between the different kinds of mounted troops, as they have destroyed the distinction between heavy and <orgName n="Light Infantry" type="infantry">light infantry</orgName> and riflemen serving on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>When, therefore, the <num value="2">two</num> regiments of cavalry were formed in <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, they were really formed as and intended to be a distinctive arm of the service.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>The term <quote>creatures,</quote> as used in the translation, would be generally accepted by all English-speaking people as a term of reproach, indicating that the persons appointed by <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0118.0023.00141.01321" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> were his dependents, sycophants and parasites &mdash; men who had no claim to respect themselves, but were subject to his will and control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>To speak of a man as the creature of the <rs>Almighty Creator</rs> conveys no reproach, but to call him the creature of another man, is to apply to him <num value="1">one</num> of the most opprobrious epithets in the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>It is therefore probable that the translator, in rendering the <rs>French</rs> phase into <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0118.0023.00141.01322" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, while giving the literal version, has failed to observe the difference between the idiom of the <num value="2">two</num> languages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>This was a critical moment, and I felt great anxiety as to its effect upon my men, who, few in numbers, had just had the shameful example of the cavalry added to the terrible trial of the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>I halted again in about half a mile, formed a line upon each side of the pike, <persName n="Pettus,,,,," id="n0118.0026.00166.01580" reg="mostcommon:Pettus,E.,W.,,:1"><surname>Pettus</surname></persName> on the right, <persName n="Watkins,,,,," id="n0118.0026.00166.01581" reg="nearbymention:Watkins,E.,P.,,"><surname>Watkins</surname></persName> on the left, each with a regiment formed on his flank perpendicularly to his line to the rear, and having made these dispositions moved again to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>The enemy soon enveloped us in front, flanks and rear, but my gallant men, under all their charges, never faltered, never suffered their formation to be broken for an instant, and thus we moved driving our way through them, fighting constantly until within a short distance of <placeName reg="Spring Hill, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101634">Spring Hill</placeName>, where we found that <persName n="Clayton,Major-General,,,," id="n0118.0026.00166.01582" reg="mostcommon:Clayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Clayton</surname></persName>, hearing of our situation, had turned and moved back to our assistance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>At the beginning of the year <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, the country had become much exhausted by the exertions and ravages of the war. Scarce a household but had lost some member of its family in the bloody conflicts of the war, to whose chances parents had hitherto consigned the lives of their children without doubt or hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>In <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0027.00168.01606" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s skill and patriotism universal confidence was reposed, and, among many disposed by nature to be sanguine, hopes of final success were still entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>But among the considerate, and those who had staked and lost both family and fortune in the war, feelings of despondency were beginning to prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>Particularly was this the case among the older class of legislators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>The vacant ranks in our armies were no longer promptly filled, as at the commencement of the war, and an exhibit of our resources, made by <persName n="Campbell,Judge,,,," id="n0118.0027.00168.01607" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, our <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0027.00168.01608" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, exhibited only a beggarly account of empty regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>Propositions to call out boys of not more than <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age, and to place negroes in the army, were already being discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>The prospects of success from such expedients were regarded as poor, indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>The chances for the fall of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> seemed imminent, as well as that of the complete closure of the ports through which we had been bringing into the <rs>Confederacy</rs> food, clothing and munitions of war. These dangers, beginning to be visible, were producing a most depressing effect on our <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>When these sources of supply should be cut off, where then would be our resources to prolong the contest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>The talk, too, for peace began to be more earnest and open than it had been hitherto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>Influential politicians on the other side, formerly of great weight in the party contests of the country, and still bound to leading men of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by old associations, were openly exerting themselves for peace, and appealing to men who used to act with and confide in them to unite with and work with them to procure a peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>Here his representations were not without effect upon his old Confederates who for so long had been in the habit of taking counsel with him on public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>He said what seemed to many of us to have much truth, that the disparity of resources was so great in favor of the <rs>Federals</rs> as would make a much further resistance on the part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, he said, if necessary for their purpose, could empty the population of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> upon the <rs>Southern</rs> coasts by the offer of the lands of the dispossessed Southern landholders, and they would come in such number that any attempt at resistance would be hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>If the resistance, too, were protracted much further, such a temper would be exerted among the adherents of the <rs>Government</rs> that they would not object to the exchange, but be quite willing for it. Believing this to be the disposition of our opponents, and that a real danger was to be apprehended from a continuance of the war, my own attention was now more seriously directed to peace than heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>It turned the thoughts of many Confederates toward peace more seriously than ever before since the commencement of the war. But the very fact of the existence of such disposition on the part of the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>The intrinsic difficulties in the way of a fair accommodation were scarcely appreciated, and the desire for change so <pb id="p.170" n="170"/>universal in the human heart was manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>Many were alarmed at the talk of conscribing negroes, and mothers, who had shrunk from nothing heretofore, were beginning to flinch at the prospect of seeing their boys of <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of age, or under, exposed to the horrors and hardships such as would then be incurred in military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>Of course we did nothing voluntarily to create expectations; and seeing no prospect of negotiating for a settlement of the difficulties between the parties, under our instructions, we did nothing so well calculated to exasperate the difference, as would have been the case had false hopes of peace, wantonly created, been unexpectedly disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>General &mdash; I wish you to bear in mind a few considerations for your government as the commander of the outposts on the lower <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>Keep out scouts who will be competent and certain of communicating to you any movement of a large body of infantry (which of course will be preceded by a large force of cavalry), down the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> on the north side, with the view to a change of base or extension of line to the <name>Acquia</name> railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>Endeavor to secure <hi rend="italics">accurate</hi> information and telegraph it clearly, avoiding the possibility <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>of ambiguity for which telegrams are noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>It is very important also to state time and place of enemy's movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>Should the enemy endeavor to cross the river anywhere in your front, it is desirable to prevent it, it is possible to delay it, and to the accomplishment of these alternatives, preferably the former, devote every effort, and if needed send for <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Hart,,,,," id="n0118.0031.00193.01806" reg="mostcommon:Hart,nomatch:0"><surname>Hart</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> near <placeName reg="Milford, Caroline, Virginia" key="tgn,2113023">Milford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>Bear in mind that your telegrams may make the whole army strike tents, and night or day, rain or shine, take up the line of march; endeavor therefore to secure <hi rend="italics">accurate</hi> information.</p>

It is probably that a corresponding move will be made by a part or all of our main body, to connect your reconnoissance with which will be highly desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>The enemy's main body will, in the event of such a move, either march directly for <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, or move up the turnpike or plank road towards Vidiersville, as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>In the former case, endeavor to impede his march with artillery and dismounted men, so as to give us a chance to strike his flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>In the latter case, close up and harass his rear, as <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n0118.0031.00193.01808" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName> did so handsomely before.

<head>Treatment of prisoners in the civil War.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>The <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> has just published the report of its <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> on the treatment of prisoners by the <rs>South</rs> in the late war &mdash; a subject spoken of by us only a few weeks ago (<ref n="volume 23" targOrder="U">vol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>The evidence of abuses at the largest Southern prisons &mdash; <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n0118.0033.00197.01830" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Bell Isle">Bell Isle</placeName>, and especially <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> &mdash; is so extensive and so excellent (including the statements of both the investigating officers sent by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>) that general denials by the author, or persons like <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00197.01831" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who do not appear to have had any personal knowledge of the matter, will hardly receive the attention the <rs>Secretary</rs> seems to expect, particularly as it appears plainly enough from the report that there is only too much foundation for the charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>The author, however, seems to think that any weakness on this point is fully covered if he can show that the <rs>North</rs> was responsible for the stoppage of exchange and that Southerners suffered in Northern prisons, having the impression, <pb id="p.198" n="198"/>apparently, that if that were the case no responsibility could afterwards rest on the <rs>South</rs>; and this seems, curiously enough, to be the position of nearly all the <rs>Southern</rs> writers who have referred to the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>Instead of frankly acknowledging and regretting these wrongs, they defend them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>Extraordinary as it may seem, this <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">Historical Society</orgName> justifies the preparations made to blow up the <num value="1000">thousand</num> and odd Union officers in the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs> at the time when the near approach of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01832" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,Ulric,,,:1"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> threatened <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; and no doubt the order of <persName n="Winder,,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01833" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><surname>Winder</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> to the same effect appears to these Southern historians in the same light.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>After this our readers will not be much surprise to learn that <persName n="Winder,,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01834" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><surname>Winder</surname></persName> was a gallant hero and <persName n="Wirz,,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01835" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,nomatch:0"><surname>Wirz</surname></persName> a saintly martyr, though the immediate responsibility for the fearful mortality rests upon them beyond a question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>It appears plainly enough from this report that the mortality at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> was almost wholly from diarrhoea, dysentery, gangrene, scurvy, and allied diseases, produced principally by overcrowding; filth, exposure, bad water, and insufficient food, and that all of these, except possibly the last, were easily remediable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>There was an abundance of land and timber for extending the limits of the prison, crowded with more than <num value="4">four</num> times the number it could healthily hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>Shelter there was none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2655"/>This refusal to provide shelter was as unnecessary as the overcrowding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>When, on the death of <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01838" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> in the spring of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Imboden,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01839" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Imboden</surname></persName> took command, he seems to have had no trouble in erecting dwellings for <num value="1200">1,200</num> or <num value="1500">1,500</num> men within a fortnight by the labor of the prisoners, and he mentions the want of shelter as <num value="1">one</num> of the principal causes of the death-rate of the previous year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>Here again we find it difficult to put ourselves in the position of an historian who thinks that this refusal of <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01840" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wirz,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0118.0033.00198.01841" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Wirz</surname></persName> to furnish shelter was justified by an attempt to escape made by <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> parties allowed to go outside the stockade months before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2658"/>Yet this is seriously said of a prison where in <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> about <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men died in an average of less than <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> confined, and in <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> the deaths were <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the average number there (<num value="1560">1,560</num> in average <num value="6200">6,200</num>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2659"/>Both were foul, when they might easily have been fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/>We closed our discussion as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>We think that we have established the following points:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/><num value="1">1</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/><num value="2">2</num>. If these regulations were violated in individual instances, and if subordinates were sometimes cruel to prisoners, it was without the knowledge or consent of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, which always took prompt action on any case reported to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/><num value="3">3</num>. If the prisoners failed to get their full rations, and had those of inferior quality, the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers suffered in precisely the same way, and to the same extent, and it resulted from that system of warfare adopted by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, which carried desolation and ruin to every part of the <rs>South</rs> they could reach, and which in starving the <rs>Confederates</rs> into submission brought the same evils upon their own men in Southern prisons.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>and subjected to the most cruel punishments upon the slightest pretexts &mdash; that friends at the <rs>North</rs> were refused the privilege of clothing their nakedness or feeding them when starving &mdash; and that these outrages were perpetrated not only with the full knowledge of, but under the orders of <persName n="Stanton,,E.,M.,," id="n0118.0033.00202.01877" reg="default:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>Even at the risk of wearying our readers, we must (for the benefit of those who have not seen our previous papers on this subject), repeat our comments on the testimony we introduced: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>It appears, then, from the foregoing statements that the prison at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was established with a view to healthfulness of location, and that the great mortality which ensued resulted chiefly from the crowded condition of the stockade, the use of corn bread, to which the prisoners had not been accustomed, the want of variety in the rations furnished, and the want of medicines and hospital <pb id="p.206" n="206"/>stores to enable our surgeons properly to treat the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point, the reply is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>The stockade at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was originally designed for a much smaller number of prisoners than were afterwards crowded into it. But prisoners accumulated &mdash; after the stoppage of exchange &mdash; in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and at other points; the <name>Dahlgren</name> raid &mdash; which had for its avowed object the liberation of the prisoners, the assassination of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0118.0033.00206.01911" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his Cabinet, and the sacking of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; warned our authorities against allowing large numbers of prisoners to remain in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 18" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, even if the difficulty of feeding them there was removed; and the only alternative was to rush them down to <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, as enough men to guard them elsewhere could not be spared from the ranks of our armies, which were now everywhere fighting overwhelming odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>We have a statement from an entirely trustworthy source that the reason prisoners were not detailed to cut timber with which to enlarge the stockade and build shelters is, that this privilege <hi rend="italics">was</hi> granted to a large number of them when the prison was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> established, they giving their parole of honor not to attempt to escape; and that they <hi rend="italics">violated their paroles, threw away their axes, and spread dismay throughout that whole region by creating the impression that all of the prisoners had broken loose</hi>. This experiment could not, of course, be repeated, and the rest had to suffer for the bad faith of these, who not only prevented the detail of any numbers of other prisoners for this work, but made way with axes which could not be replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>In reference to feeding the prisoners on corn bread, there has been the loudest complaints and the bitterest denunciations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>They had not been accustomed to such hard fare as <quote>hog and hominy,</quote> and the poor fellows did suffer fearfully from it. <hi rend="italics">But the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers had the same rations</hi>. Our soldiers had the advantage of buying supplies and of receiving occasional boxes from home, which the prisoners at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> could have enjoyed to an even greater extent had the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities been willing to accept the humane proposition of our <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioner</rs> of Exchange &mdash; to allow each side to send supplies to their prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>But why did not the <rs>Confederacy</rs> furnish better rations to both our own soldiers and our prisoners?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>and why were the prisoners at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> not supplied with <hi rend="italics">wheat</hi> bread instead of <hi rend="italics">corn</hi> bread?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>Answers to these questions may be abundantly found by referring to the orders of <persName n="Pope,Major-General,John,,," id="n0118.0033.00206.01912" reg="default:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>, directing his men <quote>to live on the country</quote> ; the orders of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00206.01913" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in fulfilling his avowed purpose to <quote>make <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> howl</quote> as he <quote>smashed things generally</quote> in that <quote>great march,</quote> which left smoking, blackened ruins and desolated fields to mark his progress; the orders of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00206.01914" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to his <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, to desolate the rich wheat-growing Valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 10" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; or the reports of <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0118.0033.00206.01915" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Philip,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, boasting of the number of barns he had burned, the mills he had destroyed, and the large amount of wheat he had given to the flames, until there was really more truth than poetry in his boast that he had made the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName> <quote>such a <pb id="p.207" n="207"/>waste that even a crow flying over would be compelled to carry his own rations.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>We have these and other similar orders of Federal <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in our archives (we propose to give hereafter a few choice extracts from them), and we respectfully submit that, for the <rs>South</rs> to be abused for not furnishing Federal prisoners with better rations, when our own soldiers and people had been brought painfully near the starvation point by the mode of warfare which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> adopted, is even more unreasonable than the course of the old <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> task-masters who required their captives to <quote>make brick without straw.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>And to the complaints that the sick did not have proper medical attention, we reply that the hospital at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was placed on <hi rend="italics">precisely the same footing as the hospitals for the treatment of our own soldiers</hi>. We have the law of the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> enjoining this, and the orders of the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</rs> enforcing it. Besides, we have in our archives a large budget of original orders, telegrams, letters, &amp;c., which passed between the officers on duty at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> and their superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>We have carefully looked through this large mass of papers, and we have been unable to discover a <hi rend="italics">single sentence</hi> indicating that the prisoners were to be treated otherwise than kindly, or that the hospital was to receive a smaller supply of medicines or of stores than the hospitals for Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>On the contrary, the whole of these papers go to show that the prison hospital at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was <hi rend="italics">on the same footing precisely</hi> with every hospital for sick or wounded Confederates, and that the scarcity of medicines and hospital stores, of which there was such constant complaint, proceeded from causes which our authorities could not control.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>But we can make the case still stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>Whose fault was it that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was utterly unable to supply medicines for the hospitals of either friends or foe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>Most unquestionably the responsibility rests with the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>They not only declared medicines <quote>contraband of war</quote> --even arresting ladies coming South for concealing a little quinine under their skirts &mdash; but they sanctioned the custom of their soldiers to sack every drug store in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> which they could reach, and to destroy even the little stock of medicines which the private physician might chance to have on hand.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>As I have stated, I covered the disputed battery with my fire in such a manner that it was utterly impossible for the enemy to remove it, and I knew that I could retake it at any time, but thought that it could be done with less loss of life at night, and therefore postponed my attack.
