<head>Introduction</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>the edition of my poems published in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct> contained the following note by way of preface:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/></p> 
<p>In these volumes, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, a complete collection of my poetical writings has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>While it is satisfactory to know that these scattered children of my brain have found a home, I cannot but regret that I have been unable, by reason of illness, to give that attention to their revision and arrangement, which respect for the opinions of others and my own afterthought and experience demand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>That there are pieces in this collection which I would <quote>willingly let die,</quote> I am free to confess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>But it is now too late to disown them, and I must submit to the inevitable penalty of poetical as well as other sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>There are others, intimately connected with the author's life and times, which owe their tenacity of vitality to the circumstances under which they were written, and the events by which they were suggested.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The long poem of <hi rend="italics">Mogg Megone</hi> was in a great measure composed in early life; and it is scarcely necessary to say that its subject is not such as the writer would have chosen at any subsequent period.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>After a lapse of <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> since the above was written, I have been requested by my publishers <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> to make some preparation for a new and revised edition of my poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I cannot flatter myself that I have added much to the interest of the work beyond the correction of my own errors and those of the press, with the addition of a few heretofore unpublished pieces, and occasional notes of explanation which seemed necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I have made an attempt to classify the poems under a few general heads, and have transferred the long poem of<hi rend="italics">Mogg Megone</hi> to the <name>Appendix</name>, with other specimens of my earlier writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>I have endeavored to affix the dates of composition or publication as far as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In looking over these poems I have not been unmindful of occasional prosaic lines and verbal infelicities, but at this late day I have neither strength nor patience to undertake their correction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Perhaps a word of explanation may be needed in regard to a class of poems written between the years <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Of their defects from an artistic point of view it is not necessary to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They were the earnest and often vehement expression of the writer's thought and feeling at critical periods in the great conflict between Freedom and Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They were written with no expectation that they would survive the occasions which called them forth: they were protests, alarm signals, trumpet-calls to action, words wrung from the writer's heart, forged at white heat, and of course lacking the finish and careful word-selection which reflection and patient brooding over them might have given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Such as they are, they belong <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> to the history of the <name>Anti</name>-Slavery movement, and may serve as way-marks of its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If their language at times seems severe and harsh, the monstrous wrong of Slavery which provoked it must be its excuse, if any is needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In attacking it, we did not measure our words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><q direct="unspecified">It is,</q> said <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0312.0003.00015.00003" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">a waste of politeness to be courteous to the devil.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But in truth the contest was, in a great measure, an impersonal <num value="1">one</num>,&mdash;hatred of slavery and not of slave-masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="pentameter"> <l>No common wrong provoked our zeal,</l> <l>The silken gauntlet which is thrown</l> <l>In such a quarrel rings like steel.</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Even <persName n="Jefferson,,Thomas,,," id="n0312.0003.00015.00004" reg="default:Jefferson,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, in his terrible denunciation of Slavery in the <hi rend="italics">Notes on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></hi>, says: <q direct="unspecified">It is impossible to be temperate and pursue the subject of Slavery.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/></p> 
<p>After the great contest was over, no class of the <rs>American</rs> people were more ready, with kind words and deprecation of harsh retaliation, to welcome back the revolted States than the <name>Abolitionists</name>; and none have since more heartily rejoiced at the fast increasing prosperity of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Grateful for the measure of favor which has been accorded to my writings, I leave this edition with the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It contains all that I care to republish, and some things which, had the matter of choice been left solely to myself, I should have omitted.</p>

<head>The Vaudois teacher.</head> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This poem was suggested by the account given of the manner in which the <name>Waldenses</name> disseminated their principles among the <rs>Catholic</rs> gentry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They gained access to the house through their occupation as peddlers of silks, jewels, and trinkets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><q direct="unspecified">Having disposed of some of their goods,</q> it is said by a writer who quotes the inquisitor <rs>Rainerus Sacco</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">they cautiously intimated that they had commodities far more valuable than these, inestimable jewels, which they would show if they could be protected from the clergy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They would then give their purchasers a Bible or Testament; and thereby many were deluded into heresy.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/></p> 
<p>The poem, under the title Le Colporteur Vaudois, was translated into French by <persName n="Felice,Professor,G.,,,de" id="n0312.0004.00017.00005" reg="expanded:Felice,G.,,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Felice</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Fort Montauban">Montauban</placeName>, and further naturalized by <persName n="Vinet,Professor,Alexandre,Rodolphe,," id="n0312.0004.00017.00006" reg="default:Vinet,Alexandre,Rodolphe,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <foreName>Alexandre</foreName> <foreName>Rodolphe</foreName> <surname>Vinet</surname></persName>, who quoted it in his lectures on <name>French</name> literature, afterwards published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It became familiar in this form to the <name>Waldenses</name>, who adopted it as a household poem.
