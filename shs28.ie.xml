<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>It was now about <num value="9">9</num> or <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> at night, and our little party went into their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> camp or bivouac.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>We were very tired after the stirring and fatiguing incidents of the day, and the most of us were soon asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>I do not know how long we had slept, when we were awakened by what seemed quite a heavy firing, both of artillery and musketry, a few miles to our right, exciting our fears of pursuit and capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It seemed so near, and the danger so imminent, that we thought best to break camp and to continue <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> our march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/><num value="1">One</num> tremendous explosion caused such panic in our little party, that <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00024.00423" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>, who had slept on my blanket at my side, became demoralized and sought individual safety in individual flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>As he disappeared in the darkness, I never expected to see him again, and never did until after my return some <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> later to <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName>, when he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> of my acquaintances to meet and greet me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>He was a poor soldier, always left the line when the firing began, impelled by thirst or some other consideration of a personal character; but his services in civil life entitled him, in my belief, to the right of civil sepulture, and you will find his grave in the section marked <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00024.00424" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,Herbert,,"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName>,</q> in the old <placeName reg="Blandford Cemetery">Blandford Cemetery</placeName>, and his epitaph in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3rd</num> chapter of Ecclesiastes, <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> and <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> verses.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It received us with a cheer and opened ranks to let us through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>With these bronzed veterans behind us, and between us and pursuit, we dismissed all fear, and passing a few <num value="100">hundred</num> rods further, we lay down to rest, and to await further orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>After waiting several hours, my orders came: <q direct="unspecified">Take the right-hand road to <persName n="Goode,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00024.00427" reg="mostcommon:Goode,nomatch:0"><surname>Goode</surname></persName>'s bridge, rendezvous at <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>There rations and transportation by rail will await you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We recommenced our march, but did not reach <persName n="Goode,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00024.00428" reg="mostcommon:Goode,nomatch:0"><surname>Goode</surname></persName>'s bridge that night, bivouaced somewhere on the side of the road, and next day made the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Just before we reached that point, however, we came to a beautiful residence on the side of the road, <num value="1">one</num> of the old-time <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 14" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> mansions, the seat and embodiment of hospitable invitation and luxurious entertainment, and under some patriarchal trees on the well-kept lawn were seated <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00024.00429" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,William,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName> and staff, evidently awaiting refreshments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>He recognized me and called to me to halt and tie my horse, and come in and get something to eat. My habit of obedience was too firmly fixed, after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of service, to permit me to refuse, and I dismounted and joined this party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We discussed the situation with as much freedom as a major-general could afford with a subaltern, but there was no sort of restraint when the buttermilk and ash-cake and fried chicken were brought out under the trees, and we enjoyed the hospitable repast as only soldiers could do, who had <q direct="unspecified">had nowhere to sleep, and nothing to eat in <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> days.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Had I known then, though, that which I discovered later on, that <orgName n="division"><persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00025.00430" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,William,,,:2"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> was not between me and the enemy, I do not know that I should have dined with so much sang-froid, or tarried with my hospitable general so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It seems that sometime during the night <rs>Mahone</rs>'s division had passed my little party, and put us again, without my knowledge or consent, in its rear or between it and the enemy, reversing the position which had afforded us such satisfactory sense of security the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/></p> 
<p>I rode with him leisurely for an hour or so, perhaps, before we came up with our men, talking more of the past, in which we had many pleasant things in common, than in the future in which neither of us saw much of promise, when he reined up his horse, and looking quietly and gravely at me, said: <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>, what command are you attached to and what are you going to do?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>I told him that I was without any especial attachment, that I had received orders to proceed to <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName> via <persName n="Goode,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00025.00432" reg="mostcommon:Goode,nomatch:0"><surname>Goode</surname></persName>'s bridge, and to conduct a few surgeons and hospital attaches, and a wounded officer or <num value="2">two</num> who came out of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> with me, to that point, where I would receive rations and transportation to some other point, I knew not where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>He said to me: <q direct="unspecified">Take my advice, send your detachment along under <num value="1">one</num> of your surgeons and stay with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/></p> 
<p>I looked back over the country which we had traversed, and there was a cloud of dust which could not have been made by our troops (for all of them had passed on), and some long blue lines could be seen in the far distance, and I asked the general what that meant.

<p>The sun was about sinking down behind the high hills and dark pines that skirted them, and things looked very peaceful but for those blue lines which I felt boded no good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>And I had great confidence in <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00025.00434" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,William,,,:2"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName> and his resources, and his men, scarred and bronzed in battle and campaign for <num value="4">four</num> long years of war&mdash;I believed in him and I believed in them&mdash;but my little company had gone on, we could reach <placeName reg="Amelia Courthouse">Amelia Courthouse</placeName> that night or the next morning, there was no enemy in front that I knew of, and I thought I had better follow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">there is <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00025.00435" reg="mostcommon:Wood,George,W.,,:1"><surname>Wood</surname></persName>.</q>

<p>The denouement, as we shall see later in my story, proved the wisdom of his words.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We went into camp that night about a mile from the courthouse, were undisturbed during the night, and rising early next morning I rode to the courthouse alone, to view the prospect and to receive my orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>There I found, or rather just before reaching there, a bivouac of officers high in command, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> generals amongst them, at breakfast around a fire, and I recognized <persName n="Branch,Major,Thomas,,," id="n0286.0004.00026.00437" reg="default:Branch,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <foreName n="Thomas">Thos.</foreName> <surname>Branch</surname></persName>, who introduced me to several officers whose names I do not remember, and who asked me to breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>I politely declined this civility and made known to the major the object of my visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>He could not tell me where <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00026.00438" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was or where or how I could get further instructions, but I was informed that the train, which, it was expected would be there with rations for the army, had gone on to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 39" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> through some blunder of somebody, and that it would probably supply the <rs>Yankee</rs> commissary instead of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Worse than that, the railroad for a short distance beyond the courthouse was torn up and probably in the hands of the enemy, and that a fight was imminent and necessary if the army proposed to follow the left, the road parallel to the <num value="1">one</num> on which my little cortege was resting on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Indeed, some desultory firing just then began on the left, and there was a general move, the officers going forward and <rs type="role2">Major</rs> B&mdash;&mdash; and I turning back to the road on which I had spent the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>I found the road filled with a long line of quartermaster wagons, ambulances, stragglers, &amp;c., and saw that they had been ordered to follow the same road, where there would probably be less interruption from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>I got my wagon, ambulance, buggy, &amp;c., into line after some scrouging and swearing, and we took up our march, we scarcely knew whither.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Only those who have followed a large army can know how slowly and with how many halts, a wagon-train can move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>A broken axle or a balking horse can detain the whole line, as there is rarely afforded an opportunity for <num value="1">one</num> wagon to turn out and pass another, indeed, the attempt is met with such a storm of obloquy and opprobrious language that <num value="1">one</num>'s nerves become demoralized, if nothing worse.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Being well mounted on a fine black mare, which I got from an <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> impressing officer who had taken her from a gentleman's farm near the <rs type="place">Courthouse</rs> the day before and which was too high strung for artillery service, I rode leisurely up and down the long lines of wagons, meeting an acquaintance now and then, and exchanging views in reference to the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>I soon became convinced that unless our pursuers were the most listless and unenterprising of men, our wagon, ambulance and baggage train would soon come to grief, and I determined to make my personal arrangements accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Riding back some half mile along the line, I came to my party, and to the usual halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>But, I forestall my story.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Stopping just then on the road to talk to some friends who occupied that portion of the line, the wagons, &amp;c., moved off, my party with them, and knowing that I could overtake them any time in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>, I loitered in good company half an hour, perhaps, and then rode on. I had gone not more than a mile when I came to an open place on the side of the road, where some <num value="1">one</num> had camped the night before, and seeing some excellent forage left unused, I dismounted, took the bit out of my horse's mouth, and thought I would give her a square meal, as I did not know when or where she would get the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>She had hardly begun to eat when I heard some <num value="1">one</num> cry, <q direct="unspecified">The <rs>Yankees</rs> are coming,</q> and saw a general rush, pell-mell, of teamsters and stragglers back to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I remembered when I traded for my black mare the day before with <persName n="Harrison,Sergeant,,,," id="n0286.0004.00027.00445" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,Sidney,,,:1"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName>, the impressing officer, he told me that she was hard to bridle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I thought of this and looked down the road, where I saw coming up from a cross-road a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> away, a company of <name>Yankee</name> cavalry, apparently about <num value="50">fifty</num>, and as they got into our <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> road forming line parallel with it, and pouring their shot into the poor mules and horses of the team.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>I thought now, if this mare is a fool, I am a goner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>But she took the bit very kindly, and in a minute I was on her back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I looked down and saw I had dropped <num value="1">one</num> of a fine pair of military gloves that somebody had given me, and as a glove in those days bore value not at all commensurate with its present worth in money, I started to get down and rescue it. But never did cavalry arrive so rapidly and in such seeming numbers before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I only had time to dash out into the woods and make my retreat through them, parallel with the road, as fast as the impediments of riding through the woods permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>This, however, was not very fast, and gave me opportunity of remarking again that they were only shooting the horses and mules, and being few in number, had no other idea than obstructing the road and disabling us by destroying the animals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>There were a number of our men rushing back through the woods on line of the road, many of them armed with muskets, and I called their attention to the fact that the <rs>Yankees</rs> were few in number and only shooting the teams, and begged them to halt and make a stand and save the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><num value="1">One</num> old soldier looked up at me for a minute, in a sort of a dazed way, and said: <q direct="unspecified">If you are fool enough to believe that, you stop, I am going on.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>I thought of the stars on my collar and of the little brief authority of command that they had given me for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and thought of endeavoring to enforce my words, but the stream of stragglers rushed by, increasing in numbers and making a panic that was irresistable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>In a few minutes we all came out together in the road, a little out of range of the fire, and here a Colonel C&mdash;&mdash;, of the cavalry, stopped in the road, and I with him, thinking that he would be able to exercise some authority and to stay the rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>But they paid no more attention to him than they did to me. Just then my attention was attracted by a captain and quartermaster, who was making the most urgent efforts and appeals to the men to halt and shoot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/><q direct="unspecified">Shoot,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1">one</num> time, and you will drive them away.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>In the meantime I was so attracted by his earnestness, if not moved by his elequence, that I did not as accurately note the situation as I should otherwise have done, and I was rather startled into a consciousness of the real condition of things by <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the enemy riding up in most disagreeable proximity, and the pop&mdash;pop&mdash;pop (not at the horses and mules this time) from their carbines, which purported to shoot only <num value="16">sixteen</num> times without being reloaded, but seemed to me then, to shoot nearer <num value="1600">sixteen hundred</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>My quartermaster, I think, made fight&mdash;somebody fired a gun. He soon went down, however, and I heard afterwards with a broken arm, though I never saw him again.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>My mare, not relishing the situation, and having been for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, I suspect, under fire, whirled with me, and I discovered that, besides the quartermaster, I held the field alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>She discovered the same thing, and several things it seemed, which lent wings to her feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Without at all consulting my wishes, but in full unison with my desires, she left incontinently, I lying down on her neck, and not knowing at what moment I should receive an inglorious wound in the most objective portion of my person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The fugitives who preceded me must have made good time also, for it seemed nearly <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile before I overtook anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Then I ran into another quartermaster whom I recognized by his expletives as an old friend from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and into a gentlemen with <num value="3">three</num> stars on his collar, whom I recognized as the president of a court-martial that I had attended some few months before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>These, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> other officers, seemed to be bringing up the rear of the fugitives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Somebody called out <q direct="unspecified">fall in <orgName type="company" n="Company Q">company Q</orgName>,</q> but it was received as a piece of pleasantry not appropriate to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>My quartermaster friend suggested that he and I take across the fields in a certain direction which he thought would bring us under the aegis of some of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00029.00447" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s fighting men.

And just as we had saluted each other a full regiment of infantry came out of a piece of woods a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> to our left, and with a yell and a double-quick made for our position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>With the peculiar reflection of the light in the little valley they were crossing, they seemed dressed in <hi rend="italics">blue</hi>, and we took them for the enemy and awaited our fate with resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>On coming up, <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> however, it turned out to be the &mdash;&mdash; <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, under <persName n="Yarborough,Colonel,,,," id="n0286.0004.00030.00450" reg="mostcommon:Yarborough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Yarborough</surname></persName>, which had been sent to the rescue of the baggage trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We went with them back, but the affair was over when we reached the place where our quartermaster had been cut down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The road was only about <num value="20">twenty</num> or <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> broad, and on either side was a thicket, <num value="1">one</num> of black jack and the other of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> growth pine, that no cavalry could penetrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>We found a few dead <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> just in front of the position which my eloquent quartermaster friend occupied, and I cheered myself with the belief that he had fallen under the fire of the quartermaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The bait which had tempted them to this specific attack was said to have been <num value="6">six</num> new <name type="weapon">Brooke guns</name> which had been brought out of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 39" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> when our forces left, and to which were attached some very fine teams which had been impressed for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>These were carried off, about an <num value="100">hundred</num> ambulances were burned and a number of wagons, and a number of horses and mules were shot, and the road so obstructed that it was several hours before we could recommence our march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/><q direct="unspecified">Yes.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/><q direct="unspecified">Then it is a bargain.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>He was light of baggage, and as soon as he replenished his commissariat he was off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>In <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> he returned, and driving up to an office which I had improvised on <address><street n="Bank street">Bank street</street></address>, he called out, <q direct="unspecified">Here's your mule,</q> and there he was, greatly improved and fattened, but his personal identity was unquestionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Whose personal property he was, was a question not so easily settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>He was an asset of a broken concern, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, which had gone into the hands of a receiver, and many representatives of that receiver, in the shape of <name>Yankee</name> quartermasters, &amp;c., lined the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>I really had some conscientious scruples on the subject myself for which some of my old comrades jeered me, and I thought I would inquire amongst <q direct="unspecified">my friends the enemy,</q> stating a supposed case.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>I did so, selecting as an umpire an officer whom I did not know, but who seemed a friendly sort of a fellow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>He paid me a doubtful compliment in replying, <q direct="unspecified">If you have got a mule of that sort, and don't sell him at once and put the money in your pocket, you are a bigger fool than I take you to be.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>I acted on his suggestion promptly; sold my mule for <measure n="75dollars" type="currency">seventy-five dollars</measure> (no man asked for a bill of sale or guaranty in those days), my buggy for <num value="75">seventy-five</num> additional, and bought a horse, saddle and bridle, and carried the horse in the back lot to my office.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Before very long several lewd fellows in blue, of the baser sort, came in and said I had stolen a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>On taking them to see him, however, he did not quite come up to their idea of plunder, and the spokesman said, <q direct="unspecified">That is not the horse.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>There was an excellent saddle blanket, though, with the fixtures, and he maintained that it was his, and that I did steal <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, but I talked him out of that idea, an accusation of <hi rend="italics">stealing</hi> was not matter for <hi rend="italics">fighting</hi> under the peculiar <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> circumstances of that day, but I was left in undisturbed possesion of my property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>But to return to the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>My ambulance was burned with all of my clothes, indeed, they were no great shakes, except a very fine new cloak of Confederate cloth, elaborately finished, the gift of a friend and made somewhere abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Its estimated value in the currency of the day was <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure>. It was too fine to wear, except by a major-general, but I regretted its loss exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>A greater loss was my diary, that dated back to the days of the <orgName n="Charleston Convention" type="convention">Charleston convention</orgName> of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, which was the real inauguration of the <name>Revolution</name>, in which the <rs>South</rs> staked its all for constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>This I regretted more than cloak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Our liver were spared, however, and some commissary stores were left, and our little party trudged along with the wagon train, until the day following, when we took the vote amongst ourselves, whether we would continue with it, constantly menaced as it was by marauding parties of the enemy's cavalry, which seemed always to be hovering on our right, and against which we had little or no protection, or whether we would follow the fighting men, at a respectful and professional distance, in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>We had not found out then that the rear was simply the left of the line, whilst the front was the right, and that there was just as much and just as hard fighting in the rear as in the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>We had only changed our route a few hours when we were told that the enemy had scooped down on the wagon train again, so we thought we were lucky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>But shortly after, we came upon some of <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00034.00469" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s men, not apparently retreating, but seeming lounging around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>I remember seeing Mr. A. A. A&mdash;&mdash; and <persName n="Wv,Mister,,,," id="n0286.0004.00034.00470" reg="mostcommon:Wv,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wv</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>J. B&mdash;&mdash; sitting down on a pile of rails with their shoes off, and not very far from the same place, I saw <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00034.00471" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName> lying down in the corner of a fence near the road, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> orderlies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>I did not recognize any of the staff I thought he was trying to get a nap, perhaps, and I did not salute or disturb him, but went leisurely on a short way towards the front, when we saw <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00034.00472" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> and several of his staff, apparently lounging around, and still suspecting nothing, we went on, nobody halting us, until, a few minutes after, we came into an elevated and open plain, where a thin line of men were strung out diagonally across our road for some distance on either side, and a little stir of some sort going on. Presently an ambulance drove up from a sort of cross country road, and went rapidly forward through the line, and I heard a lady cry out from within it, <q direct="unspecified">Don't take me right into the battle; don't take me right into the <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> battle.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>I rode forward to see if I could be of any assistance, when an infantry officer caught the mules, and taking the lines turned them around and drove rapidly down in the direction from which they came, and soon placed the party under the shelter of a hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>We followed and found some surgeons had selected the same place for the reception of the wounded, and were rigging up some sort of a table, the sanguinary usage of which we only too well divined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Of course, we cast in our lot with them, and proposed to render any assistance in our power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>But we also found seeking the same sheltered position, and in a wagon (how it got there I cannot tell), our lady friends, <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> R&mdash;&mdash; and <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> G&mdash;&mdash;, from whom we had parted the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>The battle was now opened, and in a few minutes the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victim came in, a <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> soldier, on a horse, though not a trooper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>We had only time to take him down and to see that he was badly wounded through the knee, and that his leg would probably have to be amputated, when increased noise in front indicated increased activity of some sort, and immediately a courier came dashing up and delivered an order from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00035.00473" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> or <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00035.00474" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> for the surgeons to fall back at once, and to leave the wounded, the ladies, ambulances, wagons and everything, and showed us a rough road through the woods at right angles to our position by which we were to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>And so left our poor wounded soldier on the ground, and the ambulance, wagon and ladies with hurried and rather informal adieu.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>We heard that they fell into the enemy's hands shortly after we left, and that they received very courteous attention, and were sent back to <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> under safeguard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The fight was the <num value="1">one</num> at or near <persName n="Rice,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00035.00475" reg="mostcommon:Rice,D.,A.,,:1"><surname>Rice</surname></persName>'s station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Some of you comrades have, doubtless, more accurate information in reference to it than I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/></p> 
<p>Our road soon carried us back to the main road on the right, along which the wagons, as many as were left, were dragging their slow length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>We marched all night, or rather crept along with them, until at some creek or double creek of some sort, a panic occurred, and there was crowding and confusion worse confounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>How many ever came out, I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Being light of baggage ourselves, we got ahead of them, kept the <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName> road, and went into that town about daylight the next morning, <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, with any number of soldiers, but none, I think, in regular organization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> incidents of that night which indelibly impressed themselves on my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>It was during that night that I saw <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00035.00476" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> for the last time, until after the war was over, when I <pb id="p.36" n="36"/> dined with him <num value="1">one</num> day at <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00036.00477" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s at the house on <address><street n="Sycamore street">Sycamore street</street></address>, now owned and occupied by <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. W. V &mdash;&mdash;. He was riding slowly along the line of inextricably tangled wagons, as if going to the rear, no <num value="1">one</num> with him, as far as I can remember, and I was near enough to look into his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>He rode erect, as if incapable of fatigue, and with the same dignified mien that I had so often noted on the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>From his manner, no man would have discovered that, which he so well knew, viz: that his army was melting away, that his resources were exhausted, and that in a few days he would be compelled to deliver up to the enemy, which he had so often defeated, the remnants of those ragged jackets, who had followed him for <num value="4">four</num> long years, and who had never failed him except <q direct="unspecified">in their own annihilation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/></p> 
<p>Another incident was this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Sometime during the night, on some high hills, in the county of <placeName reg="Cumberland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002156">Cumberland</placeName> or <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName></persName>, I know not which, it was very cold, and <persName n="Lewis,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00036.00478" reg="nearbymention:Lewis,R.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of our party, found a captain and quartermaster, whom he introduced to me as <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> O&mdash;&mdash;, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, who had some whiskey, and who invited me to take a swig from his canteen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drink I had taken in many months, and I suspect the whiskey was as good as any, but it had the most peculiar effect upon me. I had congratulated myself up to that night, that I had not suffered from fatigue, from hunger, from want of sleep, from fear; and yet in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> after I took that swallow of whiskey, I was hungry, tired, scared, and so sleepy that I had to get off my horse and walk to keep awake.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Well, we got into <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName>, as I said, about daylight, and my man <persName n="Burkhardt,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00036.00479" reg="mostcommon:Burkhardt,nomatch:0"><surname>Burkhardt</surname></persName> said that, if we would halt there awhile, he would go into somebody's kitchen and bake some biscuit from a little flour that he had foraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>We turned off on a by-street, and I lay down on the sidewalk, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fastening my reins around my body, to assure my awaking in case of any <num value="1">one</num>'s attempting to steal my horse, a precaution which I learned the night before, an officer informing me that some <num value="1">one</num> had stolen his horse from his side whilst he was asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>I slept for several hours, and when I awoke, the whole town was full of soldiers, and the army, infantry and artillery, was crossing the county bridge as rapidly as possible over into <persName n="Buckingham,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00036.00480" reg="mostcommon:Buckingham,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckingham</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>As we started to follow, my man, with his eye ever on the commissary, informed me that <persName n="Scott,Major,,,," id="n0286.0004.00036.00481" reg="mostcommon:Scott,W.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> was issuing rations at the railroad depot, and that we had better go by and see what we could get. It was true the <rs>Major</rs> was dealing out hurriedly, and I suspect, without requisition in duplicate, the little that was left, and, at my <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> request, delivered with his own hands a side of middling meat to my man, and we passed on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>As we reached the river, there was halted on this side, and out of the road so as not to interfere with the passage of the troops, the <rs>Yankee</rs> prisoners who had been captured on the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>I judged, from a rough estimate, that there were more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> of them, and a sorry looking set they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>A good many of them carried large pieces of meat, sides of middling, such as that I had just drawn at the last issue of rations to the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, but we had no time for conversation with them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>In less time than an hour, I suppose, the army, prisoners and all, had passed over, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00037.00483" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had given orders to burn the bridge behind us, which I think was done by <persName n="Cook,Major,,,," id="n0286.0004.00037.00484" reg="mostcommon:Cook,John,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Cook</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of his Inspectors, a gentleman who, after the war, became an Episcopal minister, and who had charge of a colored church in this place for many years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>On the hills beyond <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName>, there seemed to be a great deal of artillery halted, or parked, as I afterwards learned, and it was here (we know now, that which few knew then), that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00037.00485" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> opened his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> correspondence with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00037.00486" reg="mostcommon:Grant,James,H.,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in reference to the surrender of the army; and it was a short distance further on that they seemed to be lightening the load of head-quarter's wagons by destroying letters and papers from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>A young man named <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00037.00487" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,George,,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, from this city, who had belonged to the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA12">12th Virginia</orgName>, but who had been detailed as clerk in the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">medical department</orgName> of <placeName><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00037.00488" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, seemed entrusted with this duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>It was upon a road that had been evidently just cut through some pines, and the progress was very slow and tedious.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>We moved on without incident of especial concern to us, until <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>. There were increased signs of demoralization and disintegration all along the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Soldiers, whom I knew had <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> been soldiers of steadiness and courage, were straggling and sleeping, unarmed and apparently unconcerned; I attributed it to fatigue and hunger and exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/><rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officers</rs> of the line seemed to be doing the same thing, colonels, <rs type="role" n="General">generals</rs>, even lieutenant-generals, and I saw a member of the staff of <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00038.00494" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s most distinguished <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs> throw himself on the gronnd, and swear an oath that he would never draw his sword from its scabbard again; and then I noted that there were more and more small arms thrown aside on the roads, muskets stuck up in the ground by their bayonets, yet, with hundreds, yes, perhaps, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of others, I had not entertained for a moment the idea of any surrender of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00038.00495" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> as a whole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>To me, as to every Southron, as to every soldier, as to every man and woman and child of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it had been the embodiment of courage and fortitude and heroism.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The next day, after we had fallen into the hands of the enemy, and had had an opportunity of shaking the hands of a few fellow prisoners, we got a good account of the skirmish of the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Rising up in the morning, as soon as it was daylight, we began to cast about for our moorings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>There was before us a large open field, and thinking that lay in the direction of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00041.00513" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines we commenced to cross it, in hopes of rejoining our men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>We approached him, and, after getting within <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> paces, were halted, and brought in range of a very ugly looking navy revolver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>We did so, and found that our vidette wore a different uniform from our own, and that we had been taken in. He gave a curt order, <q direct="unspecified">right about face&mdash;march&mdash;quick.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>We obeyed promptly, and strode forward in the opposite direction to <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00042.00515" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines, he on horseback, and selecting me as <q direct="unspecified">next man,</q> and keeping his pistol very disagreeably near my head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>I ventured to remark that we were unarmed, and that I thought it not at all necessary that we should be kept quite so closely covered by his weapon, but he made no reply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>We went hurriedly on over the rough ground, his pistol bobbing up and down near the right side of my head, and I really apprehended some danger, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, you will shoot me presently.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>He replied very cheerfully that he did not care a d&mdash;n if he did. To which I said, <q direct="unspecified">I do&mdash;I care very particularly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>It would be very unpleasant and a very inglorious death.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>But he did not change his position, and I saw that I had to change my tactics, or that any little irregularity in the motion of his horse might send a bullet through my brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>So I reopened my conversation on a different scale, and said, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, those are poor spurs you wear for so fine a trooper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>I have in my overcoat pocket a beautiful pair of spurs, made out of copper taken from the old <rs>Merrimac</rs> your people sunk in the <rs type="place">Gosport Navy Yard</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>He smiled and said, <q direct="unspecified">all right.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>I took them out and handed them up to him, and he put them in his pocket, and the pistol back in the holster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>I had valued those spurs very highly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>They were made, as I said, of copper taken from the old <rs>Merrimac</rs>; made in the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster department</orgName> in <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, under care of <persName n="Stevens,Captain,Samuel,,," id="n0286.0004.00042.00516" reg="default:Stevens,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>He then asked me <q direct="unspecified">how many men of all arms <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00043.00521" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had left, and how many prisoners he had with him, and what his position was, and what roads bore upon it,</q> &amp;c., &amp;c., all questions which I could not answer, nor would have answered if I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>I did venture to say, however, for mischief, that he had more prisoners than men when I saw him last.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>This was received good-humoredly, as was intended, except by a dapper little officer, who said, <q direct="unspecified">General, he is lying, he does not want to know.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>I had not often been talked to in that way in my life, and to be thus insulted, a prisoner and my hands tied, I felt myself burn down into my boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The next morning <num value="9">nine</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>, <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> came, and no rations.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>About sunset, a beef or <num value="2">two</num> were driven up and shot on the outskirts of the camp, and skinned and flayed on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>So much of the quivering flesh was dispensed to each mess, <num value="1">one</num> member of the mess going under guard to get it. We received ours, broiled a portion of it on sticks, without salt, ate it for supper, and put the other away for breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Having no closets or other conveniences for stowing away supplies, we put our rations in our caps, and so slept with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>It was voted, after conference with our neighbors, as the only safe place we had. Poor <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> G &mdash;&mdash; had cap and rations both stolen in the night, and the last I saw of him he was marching to prison bare-headed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>The next morning a Yankee, who had been busy about our mess the day before and asking a good many questions and talking generally in a manner which led us to treat him as a nuisance, came up to me and said he had an invitation for me to take breakfast with <persName n="Richardson,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00045.00537" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,David,C.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">New York State</placeName>, and showed a permit for me to pass the lines, on my honor to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>How my friend ever knew who I was, or to what circumstance I was indebted for this mark of distinction, I could never find out. I found <persName n="Richardson,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00045.00538" reg="mostcommon:Richardson,David,C.,,:2"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName>, with some half dozen officers&mdash;surgeons, quartermasters, &amp;c., some few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from the prisoners' camp, about to sit down to a very comfortable breakfast of broiled pig, bread and coffee, spread on an extemporized table under the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>They received me very kindly, and <num value="1">one</num> of the officers remarked, <q direct="unspecified">Help yourself, <rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>, your people furnished the menu</q> (with a smile as if to intimate that the provender before us was impressed); <q direct="unspecified">we have no rations; your <persName n="Lee,,Fitz,,," id="n0286.0004.00045.00539" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> burned all of our wagon trains <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and I don't know when you will get anything more.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>We made a square meal, and having talked very pleasantly for a few minutes, both sides avoiding topics that might excite disagreeable discussion, I thanked my stranger friend and returned to camp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>It is needless to say that I was the lion, and the envy of all immediately about me. But I was invited out no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>We had a little fresh beef issued to us every day, nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>We did not know <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00046.00540" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had surrendered until <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and then we could get no reliable account of anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The fact is, our captors, or those with whom we could have any conversation, did not seem to take any sort of interest in affairs, and did not seem to know or care anything about what was going on. Soldiering was altogether mechanical with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>And those who were in charge of our camp did not even seem to take any especial interest in their business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Our soldiers, the prisoners I mean, broke the dead line constantly, and jeered and guyed the guards, until I confidently expected they would shoot into our camp, but they manifested neither pleasure nor displeasure, and I think any Confederate could have walked away that wished to&mdash;some, I suppose, did go. I am sure of it; but there was so little prospect of a man's getting home, without money, without food, or without friends, that few thought their chances would be improved by going away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Then, too, if <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00046.00541" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had surrendered, was not the war over?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>However, the hopes of all who thought that way were soon dissipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, an order came for the officers amongst the prisoners to be mustered and registered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>We were gotten out and put in line to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>I noticed the officer of the guard with a badge pinned on the lapel of his coat, which indicated that he was a Mason, or I thought so, and, drawing a bow at a venture, I took an opportunity, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time he came near me, to give a signal of distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>He came to me and asked what he could do for me. I asked what he was going to do with me. He said that the officers were to be sent to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Then I replied, I would like to get away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>He said: <q direct="unspecified">I will do anything for you which is not in violation of my oath as a soldier.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/><q direct="unspecified">What grounds have you for asking to be released?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>I said: <q direct="unspecified">I am a non-combatant.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>He remarked: <q direct="unspecified">Are you not <num value="1">one</num> of the surgeons who were captured with that artillery which did such fearful execution amongst our men on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> last?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>I said: <q direct="unspecified">Yes, but I was not at a gun&mdash;I never pulled a lanyard in my life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>He smiled and said: <q direct="unspecified">You were in mighty bad company then and will have to take your chances with them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/></p> 
<p>After a little time, he came back and said: <q direct="unspecified">According to the terms of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00046.00542" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s surrender all men and officers captured within so many hours before the time of surrender, and within so many miles of <placeName reg="Appomattox Courthouse">Appomattox Courthouse</placeName>, are entitled to their liberty and parole.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/><q direct="unspecified">Well,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">if that be so, I and my <num value="3">three</num> friends here and some <num value="80">eighty</num> or more Alabamians of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Gracie,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00046.00543" reg="mostcommon:Gracie,nomatch:0"><surname>Gracie</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, with <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> their colonel, are entitled to their parole.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>And I called up the colonel, a gentleman named <persName n="Saunders,,,,," id="n0286.0004.00047.00544" reg="mostcommon:Saunders,Joseph,H.,,:2"><surname>Saunders</surname></persName>, I think, and put him in communication with the officer of the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>The upshot of the affair was, that my guard produced pen and paper and made me state the case to <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00047.00545" reg="mostcommon:Meade,Everard,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>, I think it was directed to him, at least, and forwarded by a mounted orderly, and in a few hours, we all standing in the meantime in line in the rain, there came an order for <num value="84">eighty-four</num> of us to be sent back to <placeName reg="Appomattox Courthouse">Appomattox Courthouse</placeName>, and to report to <persName n="Bartlett,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00047.00546" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,M.,Napier,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>, a Federal officer of distinction, and a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>He, after the war, settled in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 39" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and made many friends during the few years of his life in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>I think he finally died of wounds received in action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>We were conducted under guard, through the dark and rain, several miles back in the direction of the <rs type="place">Courthouse</rs>, and reached <orgName n="command"><persName n="Bartlett,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00047.00547" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,M.,Napier,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> about <time value="9pm">9 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>He sent for <persName n="Saunders,Colonel,,,," id="n0286.0004.00047.00548" reg="mostcommon:Saunders,Joseph,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName> and myself to be brought into his tent, and, after some kind talk, gave direction for us to be carried to the picket lines and released, instructing us to report to General F&mdash;&mdash;, of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, who would parole us. According to the terms of the surrender, the <rs>Confederate</rs> generals were required to parole the men of their respective commands on paroles which had been printed by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, and which bore the impress of that fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>We were accordingly taken to the picket lines, which seemed to be somewhere in or about the small village, in a kind of blacksmith shop, where we were halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Our conductor gave the countersign, and the pickets passed us, our guards released us, and directed us, with a <q direct="unspecified">good-bye, <persName><foreName>Johnnie</foreName></persName>,</q> down the road in the direction of our lines, in the dark and in the rain, about <num value="10">10</num> or <time value="11pm">11 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Whatever became of <persName n="Saunders,Colonel,,,," id="n0286.0004.00047.00549" reg="mostcommon:Saunders,Joseph,H.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName> and his men, I know not&mdash; I never saw them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>Our little party struck out <q direct="unspecified">down the road,</q> but soon left it, to try and find shelter and somewhere to halt until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>We soon came to a small <num value="2">two</num>-story house, with a light in a window, and going up knocked at the door, and asked to be permitted to enter and remain all night, if only in the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>Some man came to the door, but refused to open it, and, saying that the house was already full of wounded, told us that we could not get in and to move on (a man who said to you <q direct="unspecified">move on</q> just about that <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> time had usually some means of enforcing his views and it was best not to discuss them), which we did, and having cleared the yard lay down for rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The water ran down my back in such a stream, however, that I protested against any such baptism by pouring, and with <persName n="Feild,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00048.00550" reg="mostcommon:Feild,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Feild</surname></persName> moved on. Going some <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or so, I suppose, in what direction we had no idea now, for we had lost our reckoning, and the darkness was worse than Cimmerian, it could be felt, we fell over a new mound of earth and another, which seemed to be new made graves, and in the end proved to be so, and gathering ourselves up for fresh adventures, came upon a small house, the door of which was open, we judged, by its being a little darker just in that place than any other, and I said to the <rs>Doctor</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">here at least we can find shelter.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/></p> 
<p>It was a weird looking concern, but I said, <q direct="unspecified">let us go in.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>But <persName n="Feild,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00048.00551" reg="mostcommon:Feild,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Doctor</roleName> <surname>Feild</surname></persName> drew back and remarked, <q direct="unspecified">that is a dangerous looking place.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>I said: <q direct="unspecified">That from <hi rend="italics">you</hi>, beats all. You are the gamest boy and man (for I had been his school-mate and seen him tried), that I ever saw, and now for you to talk about being afraid borders rather on the ludicrous; besides, what have you got to lose but your life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Come on</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>As we stepped into the door, there came to my nose that ineffable smell of gore, <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> old, which but too many of us learned to recognize in our <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> experience of war, and taking a match-box out of my pocket, I struck a light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Sure enough, we were in a field hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>There was the bloody floor, the bloody clothes and rags that had been cut off from the poor fellows who had been operated on, and even a book of anatomy, from which some young surgeon had doubtless been refreshing himself during the process of mutilation, and straw upon which the wounded had lain and the table and broken chairs, &amp;c. Well, we were at home, at least, and our right there, there was none to dispute, as we thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>There was a large open fire-place in the room, and with the straw and broken furniture we soon had a blazing fire, and lay down before it to warm and dry. We were soon asleep, of course, how long I do not know, but I was awakened by the biggest wasp nest falling down upon me I ever saw. I suppose the room had been uninhabited, and the wasps had built in the chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>We were not long in getting up and out, but we returned to the combat, and managed to destroy our new enemies, and to take possession of our old quarters, where we slept soundly until morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Leaving our house as soon as it was daylight, we made a breakfast on some hard tack, which <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> <persName n="Feild,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00049.00552" reg="mostcommon:Feild,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Feild</surname></persName> had purchased of a Yankee soldier the night before, for a gold ring, and which, tied up in his old pocket handkerchief, had soaked to an extent by the rain which made them edible, if not improved in flavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>We went out now to try to find our way to General F&mdash;&mdash;. We soon came upon <persName n="Smith,Doctor,,,," id="n0286.0004.00049.00553" reg="nearbymention:Smith,J.,P.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, who told us that after parting from us he had spent the night sitting up with his back to a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>He was an old campaigner and had done that thing before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>He had found out, somehow, the route to our destination, and we put out through mud and rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Coming to the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, which was an insignificant branch when we crossed it on the fatal <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> before, we found it quite a swollen and angry stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>But there was neither bridge nor ferry, and so with others, who I suppose also were looking for General F, we went in and waded through without the formality of undressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>The water did not reach greatly above our knees, and we suffered no inconvenience from our morning bath.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>On going about half a mile, I suppose, I came upon a group of Confederates breaking camp and about to commence the journey, no longer march now, home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>As good fortune would have it, I knew them every <num value="1">one</num>, and in company with every <num value="1">one</num>, but <num value="1">one</num>, I had commenced my military career <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> before, lacking <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Another <num value="1">one</num> I did not mention in my last address (he was before me), and <num value="1">one</num> man whose merit can be measured by his modesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>His name-well, so much the worse for you if you do not know him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>As we approached the group, all of whom were mounted and ready to be off, <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0286.0004.00049.00564" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName> accosted me: <q direct="unspecified">Well, where in the h&mdash;&mdash; have you been?</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>A swish of balls tore past us as we put spurs to our horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>And looking over our shoulders as we disappeared from them behind the hill, we saw them <q direct="unspecified">put their scrapers to it,</q> to reach the top of the hill and give us another volley.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>On our way in the darkness at <num value="1">one</num> place there shone out a bright light through an open hall door, the door being cut across the middle, the lower half of it closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Hitching and tip-toeing up, half expecting a Yankee visitor inside, camp sounds being quite distinct to our right, we found only an elderly man, his wife, and grown daughter.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>Our safest way now lay around the base of a great wooded hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>Opening a pair of bars we entered these pathless woods and picked our way along, groping in the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>It was an hour when we emerged at last, breathing free again as we came out on a little field with another house lighted up. It was a long hour of most painstaking progress, and tangle-bushes and brush and stumbling with led horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>At another place we were detained by your narrator going to sleep on his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>We were approaching an important cross-road, where we would very likely run against a picket, just west of <persName n="Custer,,,,," id="n0286.0011.00104.01211" reg="mostcommon:Custer,nomatch:0"><surname>Custer</surname></persName>'s camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>It was in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>Holding my comrade's horse as I sat on my own, he went forward to investigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>He returning and feeling about in the thick darkness, <q direct="unspecified">for an age,</q> he said, he could not find me nor the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>Finally, in some interval of my slumbers, I did hear his whispered calls, and we set forward once more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>Further on, leaving our horses in the woods, we walked across fields to the homestead of a well-known citizen north of <placeName key="tgn,2114619" n="1.000 3" reg="timberville, rockingham, virginia">Timberville</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>These reasons were presented with great force in the <name>Report</name> of <dateStruct value="1899--"><year reg="1899">1899</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>Now, as then, they are found in the fact that denials or perversions of the truth are sown broadcast all over the literature of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>Not only does this characterize their permanent histories, as then shown with such clearness of criticism and cogency of reply, but their story-writings, their perodicals and transient newspaper publications&mdash;all, are vehicles, to a degree at least, of misrepresentation on these points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>Their worthiest orators and writers have dared to tell the truth on important points, but the literature we have described is that which reaches the haphazard reader and permeates the <rs>South</rs> as well as the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>The <orgName n="Grand Army of the Republic" type="association">Grand Army of the Republic</orgName> contains many brave men. We have met them with arms in their hands.

Before proceeding to the direct discussion of this question, and because the right of a State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs> was the real issue involved in the conflict, and the proximate cause thereof, I think it pertinent to inquire particularly, in what special locality, if in any, this doctrine originated; by whom, if by either party rather than the other, it was most emphatically taught; and especially when, if in either section, the threat of the application for the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, most frequently and most ominously heard!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>In pursuance of this inquiry, and adhering to our plan of calling the <rs>North</rs> to witness, let us ask <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, What was the opinion of Northern and other unprejudiced writers on this question both prior to and since the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>Of course, we know that the right of a State to secede was commonly held by the statesmen of the <rs>South</rs>, and we venture the assertion that no unprejudiced mind can to-day read the history of the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the formation of this government under it without being convinced that the right of secession as exercised by the <rs>South</rs> did exist. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>We are gratified to be able to report, that the <num value="2">two</num> works, adversely criticised in our last Report, viz: <persName n="Fiske,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00194.01983" reg="mostcommon:Fiske,nomatch:0"><surname>Fiske</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Cooper,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00194.01984" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,Samuel,,,:4"><surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, <persName n="Estill,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00194.01985" reg="mostcommon:Estill,nomatch:0"><surname>Estill</surname></persName> &amp; <persName n="Lemon,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00194.01986" reg="mostcommon:Lemon,nomatch:0"><surname>Lemon</surname></persName>'s Histories, respectively, have found but little favor with the <rs type="place">School</rs> Boards of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>This is shown by the fact, that out of the <num value="18">18</num> counties and corporations in the <rs>State</rs> but <num value="1">one</num> has adopted <persName n="Fiske,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00194.01987" reg="mostcommon:Fiske,nomatch:0"><surname>Fiske</surname></persName>'s, and that <num value="1">one</num> has purchased a supply of <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00194.01988" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Beverley,R.,,:2"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>' History, to be used by the pupils in studying the history pertaining to the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>It will thus be seen, that the danger apprehended from the use of the <num value="2">two</num> works criticised, is reduced to the minimum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>But we must not be satisfied until that danger is entirely removed by the abolishment of these books from the list of those adopted for use, by our <orgName n="Education State Board" type="board">State Board of Education</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>We are informed by this Board, that it can do nothing in this direction pending the terms of the existing <pb id="p.195" n="195"/> contracts with the publishers of these works, which contracts expire on <dateStruct value="1902-07-31"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="31">31st</day>, <year reg="1902">1902</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>But we are also informed, that under the provisions of a law passed prior to the making of these contracts, it is competent for County and <placeName reg="City School">City School</placeName> Boards, to change the textbooks on the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> whenever they deem it proper to do so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>It is also most gratifying to us to state, what you, perhaps, already know, that all <num value="3">three</num> of the members of our <orgName n="Education State Board" type="board">State Board of Education</orgName>, are not only native and true <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0286.0020.00195.01999" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName>, but men devoted to the principles for which we fought, and that they, and each of them, stand ready to co-operate with us, as far as they can legally and properly do so, in having our children taught <q direct="unspecified">the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,</q> in regard to the war, and the causes which led to it. <hi rend="italics">We would ask for nothing more, and we should ask for nothing less, from any source</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>We repeat the recommendation heretofore made, both to this Camp and to the <rs>United Confederate Veterans</rs>, that separate chairs of American history be established in all of our principal Southern Colleges, so that the youth of our land may be taught the truth as to the formation of this government, and of the principles for which their fathers fought for the establishment and maintenance of Constitutional liberty in our land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Our attention has recently been called to the fact that in none of the histories used in our schools, is any mention made (certainly none compared with what it deserves) of the splendid services rendered our cause by the devoted and gallant band led by <persName n="Mosby,Colonel,John,S.,," id="n0286.0020.00195.02000" reg="default:Mosby,John,S.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Mosby</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>We believe, that for its numbers and resources, it performed as gallant, faithful and efficient services as any other command in any part of our armies, and that no history of our cause is at all complete, that fails to give some general idea, at the least, of the deeds of devotion and daring performed by this gallant band and its intrepid leader.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>We sometimes hear (not often, it is true, but still too often) from <pb id="p.196" n="196"/> those who were once Confederate soldiers themselves, or from the children of Confederates, such expressions as&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">We are glad the <rs>South</rs> did not succeed in her struggle for independence.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>We wish to express our sincere sorrow and regret, that any of our people should so far forget themselves as to indulge in any such remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>In the first place, we think they are utterly uncalled for, and in bad taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>In the second place, to some extent, they reflect upon the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, and those who defended that cause; and in the third place, it seems to us, if <hi rend="italics">our own self-respect</hi> does not forever seal our lips against such expressions, that the memories of a sacred past, the blood of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of those who died, the tears, the toils, the wounds, and the innumerable sacrifices of both the living and the dead, that were freely given for the success of that cause, would be an appeal against such expressions, that could not be resisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>If all that is meant by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these expressions is, that the speaker means to say, <q direct="unspecified">He is glad that the <q direct="unspecified">Union of our Fathers</q> is preserved,</q> then we can unite with him in rejoicing at this, if this is the <q direct="unspecified">Union of our Fathers,</q> as to which we have the gravest doubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>But be this as it may; we have never believed that the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> or the success of the <rs>North</rs>, was either necessary, or the best way to preserve and perpetuate the <q direct="unspecified">Union of our Fathers.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>As to the abolition of slavery: Whilst we know of no <num value="1">one</num> in the <rs>South</rs> who does not rejoice, that this has been accomplished, we know of no <num value="1">one</num>, anywhere, so lost to every sense of right and justice, as not to condemn the iniquitous way in which this was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>But we feel confident that no matter how the war had ended, it would have resulted in the freedom of slave, and as surely with the success of the <rs>South</rs> as with that of the <rs>North</rs>, although perhaps not so promptly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>We are warranted in this conclusion, from several considerations &mdash;(<num value="1">1</num>) It was conclusively shown in our last Report, that we did not fight for the continuation of slavery, and that a large majority of our soldiers were non-slaveholders; (<num value="2">2</num>) That our great leader, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0286.0020.00197.02002" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,Edward,,:48"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, had freed his slaves before the war, whilst <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0286.0020.00197.02003" reg="mostcommon:Grant,James,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> held on to his until they were freed by the <rs>Emancipation Proclamation</rs>; and (<num value="3">3</num>) Whilst <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0286.0020.00197.02004" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> issued that proclamation, he said in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inaugural:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>With the success of the <rs>South</rs>, we believe emancipation would have followed by some method of compensation for the property rights in slaves, just as the <rs>North</rs> had received compensation for the same property, when held by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>So that, with a <hi rend="italics">divided</hi> North, and a <hi rend="italics">united</hi> South, on the principles for which we contended, if the <rs>South</rs> had been successful in the war, her people would have dominated and controlled this country for <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> the last <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty-five years</measure>, as they did the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> of its existence, and, in our opinion, both the country and the <rs>South</rs> would have been benefited by that domination and control.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Again, think of the difference between the <rs>South</rs> being made to pay the war debt, and pensions of the <rs>North</rs>, and the latter having to pay those of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>And again, we reason, that if the <rs>South</rs>, in all the serfdom and oppression in which she was left by the results of the war, has accomplished what she has&mdash;(she has made greater material advances in proportion than any other section)&mdash; what could she not have done, if she had been the conqueror instead of the conquered?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>We simply allude to these material facts, with the hope that these, and every consideration dictated by self-respect, love of, and loyalty to, a sacred and glorious past, will prevent a repetition of the expressions of which we, as representatives of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause and people, justly complain, and against which we earnestly protest.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>There are some things in nature that cannot be reproduced in art. The gleam of the lightning flash cannot be reproduced on the painter's canvas; the rush of the sea's mighty waves, as they dash in billows over the waters and rise in crested foam, cannot be pictured; what painter has ever succeeded in transferring to canvas the gleam of the skies, either in the rosy flash of dawn or when the evening, with its myriads of colors of orange and <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> and burnished gold bespeak the great painter, the uncreated artist?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>And so it seems with the characters of history that are supremely great; neither the depth nor power of poet or painter can ever do them justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>Nature generally discriminates, and men who are great are so along some particular line; <num value="1">one</num> is gifted with the power of poetry, another with the gift of art; another with the power of oratory, and still another is a military genius, gifted with the wonderful power of massing great bodies of men and converging these forces at the right moment so as to win a glorious triumph and wrest victory even from defeat.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>It is not often that such men are represented in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>I have sometimes, in my personal contact with people, thought that there are some such in private life, of whom the world never hears; men who have the making of great geniuses within them; men who combine all these great virtues and qualities, which on occasion would rise and assert themselves, but they live on their quiet, hidden, beautiful lives, and many such often die without their power ever being known, perhaps, even to themselves, because the opportunity was never given to them to signalize these qualities.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5422"/>These associations (some of which were formed as far back as <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>) by the most assiduous efforts have removed our sacred dead from wayside and battle fields, placed them in cemeteries of our own, and builded monuments that will bear lasting testimony to the courage, endurance and patriotism of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier.
