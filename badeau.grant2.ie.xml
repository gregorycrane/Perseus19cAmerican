Both cities were embraced in what may be termed besieging operations; both were the object of incessant menace and attack for nearly a year; both were defended with vigor, skill, and gallantry; yet neither was completely invested, nor was either regularly approached by parallels, and only <num value="1">one</num> important sortie was ever made against the assailants' works by the beleaguered garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The siege of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was conducted at a distance of <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> by an army which retrenched itself, while owing to the intervening rivers, and forests, and swamps, as well as to the complexity of the manoeuvres&mdash;the extensions and retractions, the advances and withdrawals, on the right and left&mdash;the hostile works stretched out hundreds of miles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all, at an average distance of a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> from the centre of the city, a series of detached fieldworks was constructed, so placed as to command the principal avenues of approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>These works were <num value="12">twelve</num> in number, <num value="5">five</num> of them complete redoubts, and all arranged for either siege or <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, while some were provided with magazines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They had been built by slave labor in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war, every proprietor in the neighborhood having been compelled to furnish from <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of his entire slave force for their erection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Exterior to these was a continuous line completely encircling the town, at a distance of <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>. It consisted of epaulements, arranged generally for <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, sometimes in embrasure, sometimes in barbette, and connected by rifletrench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>These works were not extended to the southern bank until after <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00003.00027" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s attack on <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, when the rebels, fearing another advance from the same direction, completed the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It was never attacked except by reconnoitring forces in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line, starting from the river above the town, and crossing the country at a general distance of <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, reached to the bluffs overlooking the <rs type="place">valley of the Chickahominy</rs>, the crests of which it followed for a while, and then took an easterly course, striking the <rs>James</rs> again, at the strong entrenched position on <placeName reg="Chapin's Farm">Chapin's Farm</placeName>, opposite <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This was the line occupied by the rebel armies during the last year of the war, and attained a high stage of development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It consisted of a series of strong forts, with ditches and <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> palisadoed gorges, connected by infantry parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The batteries of course were the vital points, commanding the entire line; the ditches here were deep, and several rows of abatis and chevaux de frise were planted in close musket-range along the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Outside the connecting parapet, shallower ditches were dug and obstacles placed, and a line of loaded shells was laid at intervals among the entanglements, at the points confronted by national troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Splinter and bomb shelters were erected, and to increase the amount of fire, high mounds were built behind the breastworks, which served as bomb-proof shelters underneath, while the top was arranged for infantry fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Listening galleries were dug to prevent successful mining operations; dams were constructed to flood the ground where streams ran towards the rebel lines, and every appliance of the defensive art was called in play to render the fortifications impregnable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>On the opposite side of the <rs>James</rs>, the main rebel line started from <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>, and then ran south to the <rs type="place">Howlett House</rs>, on the high commanding ground that overlooks <placeName key="tgn,2302176" n="1.000 121" reg="dutch gap, chesterfield, virginia">Dutch Gap</placeName>; here the river in its windings intervened again, and the peninsula of <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName> was crossed, the line still running almost due south, till it struck the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, north-east of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>From this point the works extended south-westerly to the <placeName key="tgn,2077124" n="1.000 6" reg="weldon, halifax, north carolina">Weldon</placeName> road, when they turned to the north, and completed the circuit of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In front of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00004.00028" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, on <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName>, the rebel line was extremely strong, and like that north of the <rs>James</rs>, was intended to be held with a comparatively small <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> force, until in an emergency reinforcements could arrive; but <name>south</name> and <name>east</name> of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00005.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:12"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> kept his main army, and here he relied for defence on men rather than works, though here also the fortifications were elaborate and formidable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When the national forces crossed the <rs>James</rs>, in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, and <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00005.00030" reg="mostcommon:Smith,A.,J.,,:24"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> advanced against <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, although <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00005.00031" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> came up in time to save the town, the defences on the <name>south</name> and <name>east</name> were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Breastworks were thrown up in the night, in rear of the former position, and these were held until <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00005.00032" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:12"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> arrived; but the original works were never regained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>For about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> the new rebel line followed a ridge <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile outside the town, and was made exceedingly strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At intervals of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>, or more, according to the nature of the ground, were batteries, thrown forward as salients, and traced originally either as bastions, demi-bastions, or lunettes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>These were united by a line of parapet running from the flank of <num value="1">one</num> to that of the next; ditches were dug along the entire front, and <num value="2">two</num> and sometimes <num value="3">three</num> rows of chevaux de frise and other obstructions were laid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The batteries in time became elaborate forts, the profile was strengthened, they gave each other good flanking fire, and the approach was everywhere commanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They were generally armed with <name type="weapon">Napoleon guns</name> and small columbiads, many of the latter taken from arsenals of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at the beginning of the war, by men who wore the uniform of the government they betrayed; others came from the <rs>Richmond</rs> foundries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Behind this main line was still another parapet <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> with occasional detached works, or keeps, sometimes redoubts, to which the troops might retire in the event of the principal line being carried; while in front of all were the rifle-pits for the pickets, these also connected by a parapet affording good cover, and forming in fact a field fortification in all but relief; they were even furnished at many points with rude but effective obstructions in the shape of slashed timber, which made a sort of abatis or fraise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>These obstructions, however, were sometimes carried away for fuel by the troops on either side, under the tacit understanding so often witnessed between advanced forces in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Besides the works in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, there were <num value="2">two</num> more lines between that city and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, upon which the rebel army might fall back, if those south of the <rs>Appomattox</rs> should be forced; but the position at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> was the important <num value="1">one</num>, as any line nearer <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would not enable <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00006.00033" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:12"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to keep open his communications by the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The whole series of works around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> thus became a part of the defences of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; and, confronted from the middle of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> by the entire <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> and a part of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0260.0001.00006.00034" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s force, it acquired that character which the presence of a large body of defenders alone made practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Forts with very strong relief; a connecting parapet assuming the profile of regular field works, and protected in front by <num value="2">two</num> and even <num value="3">three</num> rows of entanglements; the whole line well flanked, and its approaches everywhere swept by artillery&mdash;these constituted a position, which, when held by only <num value="1">one</num> rank of good troops with breech-loading <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> weapons&mdash;it is the universal testimony of modern war, can hardly be carried by direct assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In <dateStruct value="1864-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the national entrenchments extended no further north of the <rs>James</rs> than the tete de pont at <placeName reg="Deep Bottom, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2280567">Deep Bottom</placeName>; on the south bank the lines ran parallel with the rebel works across <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName>, from the <rs>James</rs> to the <placeName key="tgn,1121283" n="1.000 30" reg="appomattox, virginia, united states">Appomattox river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>There were also strong entrenched works at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, to protect the base of the army, and batteries were established at intervals on the <rs>James</rs>, from <placeName reg="Chapin's Bluff">Chapin's Bluff</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Each army was thus completely surrounded by its own entrenchments, and <num value="1">one</num> fortified camp was in reality besieged by another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The national lines, like those of the rebels, consisted of infantry parapet connecting a series of more important works, by which the intermediate entrenchment was enfiladed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>These larger works varied very much in magnitude and tracing, but were <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> generally redoubts, built with a view to containing garrisons strong enough to hold their own, in case the connecting parapet was abandoned and the infantry force withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>In this they differed from the rebel batteries south of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, which with few exceptions were open to the rear, and could not be held if the line was broken at any <num value="1">one</num> point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The entrenchments on both sides were built of the red loamy clay found in the eastern parts of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, a soil peculiarly adapted for earthworks, as it is easily dug, and stands well when formed into slopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The parapets were several feet thick and <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> high; the faces were carefully traversed, and some of the guns had shields for protection against rifle-shots, made of <num value="3">three</num> thicknesses of plank nailed together, and fitted over the breech in front of the sight, a slit being cut in the shield, in which the gun was laid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The revetments were almost always of logs, laid horizontally, and parallel with the crest of the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The chevaux de frise were constructed of square logs, with holes through which the spikes were passed, after which the lengths were lashed together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Covered ways, starting from tunnels under the parapet, gave access to the line of rifle-pits, which was sometimes only <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> outside.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><num value="1">One</num> of the principal features of the works was the extensive use made of bomb-proofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Owing to the great length of the lines, the same troops were often kept in the trenches for weeks, and it was necessary to give them ample protection from the weather as well as from the hostile bombardment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The bomb-proofs were long trenches cut in the ground just behind the parapets and parallel with them; the sides of these trenches were lined with rough wooden slabs, the roof was supported by uprights bearing plates, on which the cross-pieces were laid; and over these, earth was heaped to the depth required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The cross-pieces were laid close, not only for strength, but to prevent the earth from crumbling and falling through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Fireplaces and chimneys were also constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>According to the shape of the ground, and the site, the bomb-proofs were either sunken, half sunken, or elevated; if the last, the top was sometimes used as a cavalier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>In <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places the very parapet of the main line was converted into a bomb-proof.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>All through the rough exterior of conversation, the abundant jokes, the plain, homespun talk,&mdash;as plain as his face, but as full of power and meaning,&mdash;there was evidence enough that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00138.01430" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was a great man. <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00138.01431" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Butler,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> often said at this time that he thought him by far the greatest man who had occupied the <name>Presidential</name> chair since <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00138.01432" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>America in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 11" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>'s time was an isolated and inconsiderable colony; the world cared little by comparison for the result of the <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> struggle in which she was engaged, and whatever sympathy was aroused, was in her behalf; whereas, in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00139.01438" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s day, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> took the keenest interest in the success of the <rs>South</rs>, and stood ready and anxious to avail themselves of any favorable opportunity to interfere.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>Under these circumstances, the caution mingled with determination with which the <rs>President</rs> acted, the skill with which he avoided many embarrassments and overcame many obstacles; the tact with which he dealt with the rebels; the foresight he often displayed, of events; the knowledge of human nature; the patience with men and circumstances; the instinctive sympathy with popular feeling, which impelled him to withstand all advice and entreaties to take important steps before the proper time, and yet to accomplish his purpose promptly when the nation was ready to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> him; the abnegation of self; the charity for personal and public enemies, the tender-heartedness towards offenders; and the steadiness with which he pursued the objects of the war and of the nation&mdash;all combined to make him <num value="1">one</num> of the most striking characters in American history.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>The military situation in every quarter of the country was of course the absorbing theme; the latest news from <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00140.01447" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:4"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> or <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00140.01448" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:16"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, the condition of affairs inside of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the strength of the rebel armies, the exhaustion of the <rs>South</rs>; the information extracted from recent prisoners, or spies, or from the rebel newspapers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>From this the transition was easy to earlier <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> events of the war, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00141.01449" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Butler,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was always ready to relate what he had seen, to tell of his campaigns, to describe the character of his comrades and subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>Before the war he had met most of the men who were now prominent, rebels as well as national officers; either in the old army, or at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> as cadets; and the knowledge of their character he thus obtained was extremely useful to him at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>He often said of those opposed to him: <q direct="unspecified">I know exactly what that general will do;</q> <q direct="unspecified">I am glad such an <num value="1">one</num> is in my front;</q> <q direct="unspecified">I would rather fight this <num value="1">one</num>, than another.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>So also with those who were now his subordinates; what he had learned of them in garrison, on the <rs>Canada</rs> frontier, or at the <rs>West</rs>, before the <name>Indians</name>, or crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7006455;tgn,7006455" n="0.012 000000.4836	placename;tgn,7006455;panama, provincia de panama, panama,Provincia de Panama,Panama,North and Central America;0.012 000000.4836	placename;tgn,7006455;panama, provincia de panama, panama,Provincia de Panama,Panama,North and Central America" reg="panama, provincia de panama, panama,Provincia de Panama,Panama,North and Central America;panama, provincia de panama, panama,Provincia de Panama,Panama,North and Central America">isthmus of Panama</placeName>, in cholera time,&mdash; all was of use now. No man was better able to predict what an individual would do in an emergency, if he had known or seen much of him before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>The most ordinary circumstance to him betrayed character; and as we sat around our fire at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, he told stories by the hour of adventures in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, or rides on the prairies, or intercourse with Californian miners, which threw a flood of light on the immense events in which the same actors were now engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>And yet he never seemed to observe, and thus unconsciously deceived many who fancied they were deceiving him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>Of course, all listened eagerly and deferentially to what he had to say, but all took part in the conversation: a simple captain could tell his story without interruption from the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general--in chief</rs>&mdash;save when he asked for a light for his cigar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>Politics at home were often discussed, and unless strangers <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> or foreigners were present, with great freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1254"/>Gossip about men whom most of us had known came in, and tales of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> life were common.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>But though familiar, the talk was by no means vulgar: no coarse language was ever used in the presence of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, the most modest man in conversation in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>A profane word never passed his lips, and if by some rare chance a story a little broad was told before him, he blushed like a girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>Yet he was entirely free from cant, and never rebuked in others the faults which he himself scrupulously avoided.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Sometimes, in great emergencies, his lips became set and his mouth rigid, his expression stern; but even then his eye rarely flashed, and his voice betrayed no emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>His tones grew calmer and more distinct; his mind seemed to kindle, his intellectual vision quickened; the windows of his soul were opened, and he looked out, through and beyond whatever was obscure; but all this only those who knew him long and intimately, and watched him closely, could discern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>To others he was as impassive as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>I remember only twice during the war to have seen in him what might be called a shadow of excitement: once, when he was indignant at a great wrong put upon a friend; and once, in the field, when we passed a teamster who was ill-using a horse, he shook his clenched hand at the man, and threatened him with arrest for cruelty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>As the night wore on, <num value="1">one</num> and another of the frequenters of the camp fire dropped away, and by midnight, the circle was winnowed to <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num>, <pb id="p.143" n="143"/> of whom <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00143.01451" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Butler,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was always <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>The only symptom of anxiety he displayed under the tremendous cares imposed upon him was wakefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>He never wanted to go to his camp bed. His immediate aides-de-camp discovered this, and as he was willing to sit under the cold clear sky and stars till <time value="3">three</time> and <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, wearing them all out, they at last agreed among themselves to wait up with him in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>He never knew of this, but we often bargained with each other for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> of rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>Many of these nights can I remember, during that long winter at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, when every <num value="1">one</num> was asleep but the commander of the armies and his single officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>If the weather was inclement, we bore it as long as we could outside, and then sought shelter in his cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>How confidential and intimate his conversation could at such times become, only those thrown closely with him knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>His recollections of the past, the stories of his great battles and campaigns, the personal incidents of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and <persName n="Donalson,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00143.01452" reg="mostcommon:Donalson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donalson</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>; the details of his earlier career; his belief in the ultimate success of our cause; his prediction of events&mdash;all were clearly told in terse and often eloquent language; with every now and then a pregnant utterance that showed his appreciation of individual character or close sympathy with men in masses, the native strength of his intellect, or the keen penetration of his judgment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>It was then I learned to know him best and like him most; then I understood that he was really of the <name>Homeric</name> type; the sort of man that many in our modern artificial civilization fail to recognize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>Because he was not great in the way they thought <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> he ought to be, they pronounced him not great at all. Because he was quiet, simple, unadroit, undemonstrative of power or feeling, absolutely plain in speech and manner and action, they supposed him stolid and dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>But the traits which affect nations and parties, if not dilettanti and doctrinaires; the directness of purpose and speech, the absolute honesty of intention, the simplicity of behavior, the utter unselfishness, rising at times into heroic proportions; the freedom from vanity; the courage which was never daunted, the determination which was never disturbed, the steadiness of nerve that bore him up amid carnage and apparent disaster; and above all, the supreme self-control that preserved him always calm and unruffled, without elation in victory or despondency in adverse fortune &mdash;these were superadded to a clearness and soundness of judgment almost unrivalled, and a power of lucid and exact expression so absolute that when he was in earnest, a child could not mistake his meaning; a broadness of intellect that comprehended a continent, a fertility of resource in emergencies, displayed in a <num value="100">hundred</num> battles, and a grand power of administration that carried on the campaigns in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and on the sea-coast, in <rs type="direction">West</rs> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and beyond the <rs>Mississippi</rs>&mdash;all at the same time without confusion, and made each tend to the success of every other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>Mingled with these was a tender-heartedness that could not bear the sight of unnecessary pain; a clemency for the vanquished never surpassed, and which indeed transcended not only the expectation of the enemy, but the wishes of many of his own friends; a regard for the feelings of others that spared them mortification, sometimes <pb id="p.145" n="145"/> at the risk of his own fame; a carelessness of triumph, which led him to leave his conquests before he had contemplated them; a delicacy in conferring benefits, which heightened the obligation he sought to lessen; and finally a devotion to duty so pure that he was unconscious that it was remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>Some of these traits were revealed in the shock of battle, some on the tedious march, some in the general intercourse of the camp, but not a few became apparent&mdash;all unknown to him who displayed them&mdash;during the long night-watches of the siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>The wife of the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> had often spent a few weeks with him in camp or siege, or when he was quartered in a captured town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>His children too visited him, the eldest only <measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> of age at this time, the youngest <num value="7">seven</num>; and the man who directed the destinies of armies, and was unalterable in his decisions when he believed them right; who ordered the devastation of the <rs type="place">Valley of Virginia</rs>, and went unshrinking through the <rs>Wilderness</rs> campaign, was as bland and playful with his wife and children as the humblest soldier in the ranks before he went to war. All the simplicity and gentleness of his nature came out in this companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>He had been married <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure>, and still seemed to find his greatest solace in the domestic relations; while, like a true woman, the wife was interested in whatever concerned him; anxious to relieve him from petty cares, proud of his success, but never trenching beyond her proper sphere; exercising all her woman's influence to soothe and support, never to vex, or annoy, or disturb.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>It was curious to watch&mdash;not her, for her tact would not have allowed her to make the mistake, but others around him, who thought they had influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/>They had influence, undoubtedly, in little things; in details, in their own province, or department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00146.01458" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Butler,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was not unwilling to let others arrange for him, and decide for him many unimportant matters; and even many matters of consequence, in which he trusted their judgment or knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>He would not dictate to a quartermaster the minutiae of his duty; he rarely told a secretary <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> what language to employ in writing a letter; but when the moment arrived at which he deemed it necessary to decide for himself, no advice, or clever pleading, or adroit management, could avail to shake him. In a great matter he was absolutely immovable, and sometimes equally so in some apparently trivial <num value="1">one</num>, if he considered that the time had come to make his will obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>Then, the people who fancied they were so dexterous, or all-powerful, or indispensable, discovered their mistake; and, though <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00147.01459" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Butler,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> often sought to soothe their chagrin or cover their defeat, he did not swerve from his purpose, when once it was determined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>He was, however, always most averse to giving pain; and it may be that harsh critics will censure him as too long-suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>He certainly sometimes bore with subordinates who were obstinate, or selfseeking, or unskilful, to a point to which many of his friends could not follow him. Several of the generals whom at various times he displaced, contended that their fault had been condoned, because it was not promptly punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>They had been retained after a defeat, or a blunder, or a culpable negligence, and therefore <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0260.0004.00147.01460" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Butler,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> should not subsequently have condemned them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>And there is a certain force in the pleading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>He did endure conduct which perhaps he should have put an end to sooner; he continued men in command, who, if not failures, were not successful, and, as chief of the armies, it may have been his strict duty to displace them earlier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>But this leniency did not proceed from sheer good-nature or soft-heartedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>But he was not alone to blame, and it is probable that another leader of the sinking cause would have incurred the same censures and aroused the same animosities among his followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>The unsuccessful are apt to be acrimonious, and the quarrels of the rebels were no less violent among themselves than with their so-called <rs type="role2">President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>They vehemently accused each other of treason to the cause, perhaps because each felt that his own fealty was waning; and, if so, it was not strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>The suffering for food, the difficulty of supplying even the army with rations and the horses with fodder, the scarcity of fuel, the depreciation of the currency, the interruption of manufactures, the annihilation of ordinary commerce, the absorption of agriculture&mdash;all <pb id="p.354" n="354"/> these results of the war were having their natural effect, even in regions where the tread of a hostile army had not been known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>The greatest ladies wore coarser garments than they had furnished their own servants in other days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>In fine houses, black beans were served on silver dishes, and costly wine&mdash;all that was left of ancient luxuries&mdash;garnished the commonest fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>Every household mourned the loss of a favorite member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>Many were deprived of all support and stricken to the earth by the calamities of war. The hospitals were crowded, and not only delicacies but medicines were difficult, and often impossible, to procure for those whose lives depended on their obtaining them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>There was, besides, the constant feeling of uneasiness about the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>Wherever the national armies penetrated, slavery was at an end. The field hands deserted their masters by tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>The house servants, it is true, with the affectionate docility of their race, were generally faithful, and the entire slave population abstained from plunder and worse crimes, incident to a servile revolution, with a unanimity that was <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable features of the war. Neither murder nor arson was committed; there was no revengeful or lustful passion displayed by these <num value="1000000">millions</num> waiting to be freed, who struck no blow against their masters at this crisis in the fate of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>But none the less, the <num value="1000000">millions</num> believed that they were the great stake of the war; that it was to free them every battle was fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>Their wishes were all for the invaders; and such help as in their simple, ignorant, but earnest way they could afford was never <pb id="p.355" n="355"/> lacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>They gave important information constantly to national officers; they sheltered and succored and concealed national escaped prisoners and scouts and spies; they welcomed everywhere, with extravagant rejoicings, the advent of the successful national armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>All this the rebels perfectly knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>They endeavored to conceal the knowledge from the slaves, and from their enemies, and also to restrain the expression of it even among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>But there was always this dark shadow of what was possible hanging over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>There was the absolute destruction of slave property inevitable; there was the anxiety what to do with the slaves, and what the slaves might do with themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>This condition had existed since the beginning of the war, but as the drain upon the troops became greater, and the demand could no longer be supplied, the arming of the blacks began to be discussed, and, in the winter of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, it was <num value="1">one</num> of the great questions that agitated the public mind throughout the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>The blacks had been useful soldiers for the <rs>Northern</rs> armies; why should they not be made to fight for their masters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>it was asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>Of course, there was the immediate query whether they would fight to keep themselves in slavery; and this opened up a subject into which those who discussed it were afraid to look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>Nevertheless, it seemed unavoidable that a black conscription should be attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>There could be no surer sign of the straits to which the rebels were reduced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>Then there were, all through this winter, many who in spirit were already overcome; who were convinced that it was impossible to hold out much <pb id="p.356" n="356"/> longer against the <rs>North</rs>, that aid from abroad was hopeless; and who preferred to yield in time, and thus secure good terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>The bare suggestion of such a course evoked from the sterner spirits the most violent denunciations, and charges of cowardice and treachery were freely bandied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>Nevertheless, attempts at compromise were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>Rebel congressmen, for advocating submission, were imprisoned; prominent men were decried for alleged sympathy with the <rs>North</rs>, and then attempted to escape from the sinking Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>But for all this, the rebel government itself made overtures for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>They were not such, however, as the national authorities, now conscious that they were rapidly advancing to supreme success, would for a moment consent to listen to. The movements of armies were not even delayed while the rebel commissioners presented their propositions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Nevertheless, though rancors and heartburn-ings were rife, though the councils of the rebellion were divided, though its people suffered and its territory was devastated, though it was deserted in its hour of need by those who had applauded or incited its efforts at the start, neither its leaders nor its soldiers were yet conquered; if depressed, they did not despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>They determined, even at this crisis, to keep up their courage, to gather up their strength, to make still another effort, to try still another scheme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6297"/>They were not so apt to lose head in battle, and recovered sooner from the effects of disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6298"/>The enemy oftener succeeded by surprise, but seldom reaped the full result of a victory; and rarely won except by a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, impulsive, and unexpected onset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6299"/>In this the <name>Southerners</name> were like the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6300"/>But, when it came to sustained, renewed, deliberate assault, it was the national soldiers who bore away the prize.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6301"/>But, after all, it is only by transcendent effort that transcendent success is ever attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6302"/>Excellent people, good soldiers, brave men, careful generals, are not enough in offensive war with determined foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6303"/>The troops who do what can neither be expected nor required are the ones who are victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6304"/>The men who, tired, and worn, and hungry, and exhausted, yet push into battle, are those who win. They who persist against odds, against obstacles, against hope, who proceed or hold out unreasonably, are the conquerors.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6310"/>In such an <num value="1">one</num> there should be found, above all things, a comprehensive grasp of the situation, of the relations of the various points and events of the field to each other, and to the general purpose; a faculty of retaining the head under unexpected circumstances; not only of planning in advance, but of originating new combinations when the old ones are interrupted; and, as much as anything, a judgment and impulse combined, both audacious yet neither incautious; a decision in acting on this judgment and impulse instantaneously, without waiting to balance chances; and, thereafter, neither doubt nor delay, but only belief and persistence to the end.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6331"/>The enemy's immense superiority in cavalry and the inefficiency of the greater part of mine has been the cause of all my disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6399"/>I had to order the guns to be withdrawn; but the difficulties of the ground were such that <num value="12">12</num> guns were lost, because they could not be gotten off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6412"/>On the night of the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00664.07304" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, with <num value="2">two</num> brigades of cavalry and a brigade of infantry mounted behind his men, was sent around the left to surprise what was reported by his scouts to be the camp of a division of cavalry; he found, however, that the camp had been moved, and he only found a picket, which he captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6413"/>As I could not remain at <placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's Hill</placeName>, for want of forage, I then determined to try and get round <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's flanks, and surprise him in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6414"/>After ascertaining the location of the enemy's camps, from observations from a signal station on <placeName reg="Massawattan mountain">Massawattan mountain</placeName>, I determined to move around the left flank of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6415"/>I selected this flank from information furnished by <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0260.0013.00664.07305" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,J.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hotchkiss,Captain,,,," id="n0260.0013.00664.07306" reg="mostcommon:Hotchkiss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hotchkiss</surname></persName>, who had gone to the signal station, and because the greater part of the enemy's cavalry was on his right, and <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00664.07307" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName>'s attempt had caused that flank to be closely picketed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6416"/>To get around the enemy's left was a very difficult undertaking, however, as the river had to be crossed twice, and between the mountain and river, where the troops had to pass to the lower ford, there was only a rugged pathway; I thought, however, the chances of success would be greater, from the fact that the enemy would not expect a move in that direction, on account of the difficulties attending it, and the great strength of their position on that flank.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6421"/>The artillery was brought up and opened on it, when it fell back to the north of <placeName reg="Middletown, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,7014049">Middletown</placeName>, and made a stand on a commanding ridge running across the pike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6422"/>In the meantime, the enemy's cavalry was threatening our right flank and rear, and, the country being perfectly open, and having on that flank only <persName n="Lomax,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07325" reg="mostcommon:Lomax,nomatch:0"><surname>Lomax</surname></persName>'s old brigade, numbering about <num value="300">300</num> men, it became necessary to make dispositions to prevent a cavalry charge, and a portion of the troops were moved to the right for that purpose, and word was sent to <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07326" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,J.,B.,,:1"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>, who had got on the left with his division, and <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07327" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>, who were then also to swing around and advance with their divisions; but they stated in reply that a heavy force of cavalry had got in their front, and that their ranks were so depleted (by the number of men who had stopped in the camps to plunder) that they could not advance them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6424"/>I sent word to him to get some position that he could hold, and, the cavalry in front of <persName n="Kershaw,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07329" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,nomatch:0"><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07330" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,J.,B.,,:1"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> having moved towards <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07331" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, they were moved forward, and a line was formed north of <placeName reg="Middletown, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,7014049">Middletown</placeName>, facing the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6425"/>The cavalry on the right made several efforts to charge that flank, but was driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6426"/>So many of our men had stopped in the camp to plunder (in which I am sorry to say that officers participated), the country was so open, and the enemy's cavalry so strong, that I did not deem it prudent to press further, especially as <persName n="Lomax,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00665.07332" reg="mostcommon:Lomax,nomatch:0"><surname>Lomax</surname></persName> had not come up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6429"/>The enemy again made a demonstration, and <persName n="Ramseur,General,,,," id="n0260.0013.00666.07338" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ramseur</surname></persName>, who was acting with great gallantry, was wounded, and the left again gave way, and then the whole command was falling back in such a panic that I had to order <persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00666.07339" reg="mostcommon:Pegram,nomatch:0"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Wharton,,,,," id="n0260.0013.00666.07340" reg="mostcommon:Wharton,nomatch:0"><surname>Wharton</surname></persName>'s commands, which were very small and on the right, to fall back, and most of them took the panic also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6430"/>I found it impossible to rally the troops; they would not listen to entreaties, threats, or appeals of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6431"/>A terror of the enemy's cavalry had siezed them, and there was no holding them back; they left the field in the greatest confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6432"/>All the captured artillery had been carried across <placeName reg="Meadow Mills, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,2504136">Cedar creek</placeName>, and a large number of captured wagons and ambulances, and we succeeded in crossing our own artillery over, and everything would have been saved if we could have rallied <num value="500">500</num> men; but the panic was so great that nothing could be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6433"/>A small body of the enemy's cavalry dashed across <placeName reg="Meadow Mills, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,2504136">Cedar creek</placeName> above the bridge, and got into the train and artillery, running back on the pike, and passed through our men to this side of <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>, tore up a bridge, and thus succeeded in capturing the greatest part of the artillery and a number of ordnance and medical wagons and ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6434"/>The men scattered on the sides, and the rout was as thorough and disgraceful as ever happened to our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6435"/>After the utter failure of all my attempts to rally the men, I went to <placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's Hill</placeName> with the hope of rallying the troops there, and forming them in the trenches; but, when they reached that position, the only organized body of men left was the prisoners, <num value="1300">1,300</num> in number, and the <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName> in charge of them; and I believe that the appearance of these prisoners, moving back in a body, alone arrested the progress of the enemy's cavalry, as it was too dark for them to discover what they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6436"/>Many of the men stopped at <placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's Hill</placeName>, and went to their old camps, but no organization of then could be effected, and nothing saved us but the inability of the enemy to follow with his infantry, and his expectation that we would make a stand there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6437"/>The state of things was distressing and mortifying beyond measure; we had within our grasp a great and glorious victory, and lost it by the uncontrollable propensity of our men for plunder, in the first place, and the subsequent panic among <pb id="p.667" n="667"/> those who had kept their places, which was without sufficient cause, for I believe that the enemy had only made the movement against us as a demonstration, hoping to protect his stores, etc., at <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and that the rout of our troops was a surprise to him. I had endeavored to guard against the dangers of stopping to plunder in the camps by cautioning the division commanders, and ordering them to caution their subordinates and take the most rigid measures to prevent it, and I endeavored to arrest the evil while in progress without avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6438"/>The truth is, we have very few field or company officers worth anything, almost all our good officers of that kind having been killed, wounded, or captured, and it is impossible to preserve discipline without good field and company officers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6441"/>The plan was a bold <num value="1">one</num> and was vigorously pursued by the division commanders, and it was successful, but the victory already gained was lost by the subsequent bad conduct of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6442"/>The artillery throughout, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, in this as well as in all the actions I have had, behaved nobly, both officers and men, and not a piece of artillery has been lost by any fault of theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6552"/>The facts upon which these complaints are founded tend to show that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> neutrality is not respected by the agents of that government, and that undue and reprehensible attempts have been made by them to involve <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> in a war in which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> had declared her intention not to take part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6553"/>In the first place, I am sorry to observe that the unwarrantable practice of building ships in this country, to be used as vessels of war against a state with which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> is at peace, still continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6554"/><name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> government had hoped that this attempt to make the territorial waters of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> the place of preparation for warlike armaments against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, might be put an end to by prosecutions and by seizure of the vessels built in pursuance of contracts made with the <rs>Confederate</rs> agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6555"/>But facts which are, unhappily, too notorious, and correspondence which has been put into the hands of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> government by the minister of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, show that resort is had to evasion and subtlety in order to escape the penalties of the law; that a vessel is bought in <num value="1">one</num> place, that her armament is prepared in another, and that both are sent to some distant port beyond <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> jurisdiction, and that thus an armed steamship is fitted out to cruise against the commerce of a power in amity with <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6556"/>A crew composed partly of <name>British</name> subjects is procured separately; wages are paid to them for an unknown service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6557"/>They are dispatched, perhaps to the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and there or elsewhere are engaged to serve in a Confederate man-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6558"/><pb id="p.680" n="680"/></p> 
<p>Now, it is very possible that by such shifts and stratagems the penalties of the existing law of this country, nay, of any law that could be enacted, may be evaded; but the offence thus offered to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> authority and dignity by the <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> rulers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, whom <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> acknowledges as belligerents, and whose agents in the <name>United Kingdom</name> enjoy the benefit of our hospitality in quiet security, remains the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6559"/>It is a proceeding totally unjustifiable, and manifestly offensive to the <rs>British</rs> crown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6560"/>Secondly, the <rs>Confederate</rs> organs have published, and <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> government have been placed in possession of it, a memorandum of instructions for the cruisers of the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which would, if adopted, set aside some of the most settled principles of international law, and break down rules which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> government have lawfully established for the purpose of maintaining <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6561"/>It may, indeed, be said that this memorandum of instructions, though published in a Confederate newspaper, has never as yet been put in force, and that it may be considered as a dead letter; but this cannot be affirmed with regard to the document which forms the next ground of complaint.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6562"/>Thirdly, the <rs>President</rs> of the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has put forth a proclamation acknowledging and claiming as a belligerent operation, in behalf of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the act of <persName n="Burley,,Bennett,G.,," id="n0260.0015.00680.07431" reg="default:Burley,Bennett,G.,,"><foreName>Bennett</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Burley</surname></persName> in attempting, in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, to capture the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Michigan</rs>, with a view to release numerous Confederate prisoners detained in captivity in <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, on <placeName reg="Lake Erie, United States" key="tgn,2318573">Lake Erie</placeName>.</p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>I have not the least desire to interfere in the civil policy of our government, but would shun it as something not to my liking; but occasions do arise when a prompt seizure of results is forced on military commanders not in immediate communication with the proper authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/>It is probable that the terms signed by <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0260.0018.00701.07658" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and myself were not clear enough on the point, well understood between us, that our negotiations did not apply to any parties outside the officers and men of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, which could easily have been remedied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>No surrender of any army not actually at the mercy of an antagonist was ever made without <q direct="unspecified">terms,</q> and these always define the military status of the surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6753"/></p> 
<p>We have a right to use any sort of machinery to produce military results; and it is the commonest thing for military commanders to use the civil governments in actual existence as a means to an end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>As to punishment for past crimes, that is for the judiciary, and can in no manner of way be disturbed by our acts; and, so far as I can, I will use my influence that rebels shall suffer all the personal punishment prescribed by the law, as also the civil liabilities arising from their past acts.</p>
