<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The line was on a prolongation with the north front of the fort, nearly at right angle with the river, extending westward toward the bayou.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>About noon the gunboats renewed the attack on the fort on the opposite side of the river, and to the rear of our position opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>There was heavy and rapid firing on the extreme left, which induced me to believe that the enemy were attempting to turn our left flank.

Whilst this movement was being executed, and the remainder of the brigade was endeavoring to fill up, as far as possible, the intervals made by the detached companies ordered to the left, the enemy advanced, and made a vigorous attack on our entire line, and, notwithstanding our line was very much weakened, they were promptly and handsomely repulsed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The enemy made <num value="3">three</num> different attempts, in quick succession, to carry our line, but were as often promptly repulsed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>About <time value="4pm">4 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Whilst this was being executed, <num value="2">two</num> iron-clad gunboats passed the fort, delivering their fire immediately opposite and very near to the fort, completely silencing it, as well as the <num value="2">two</num> guns on this part of the line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The enemy's gunboats and batteries had now complete command of our position, taking it on the right flank, front and rear, literally <hi rend="italics">raking</hi> the entire position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It was at this particular crisis, about <time value="4:30pm">4.30 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>As I could not believe it possible that a white flag could be thus treacherously displayed in any part our lines with impunity, I was deceived, and by this sudden and simultaneous display of white flags, as well as by the cessation of all firing on the left, together with the repeated and emphatic manner in which the order came up the line, coupled with the name of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, I was convinced, at the <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> time, that the order must have originated from the proper source, and consequently, did not feel authorized to countermand the order to prevent the order passing up the line to the fort, in the same way in which it had reached me. And no order could have been of any avail in counteracting the consequences, as the act had already been consummated, and the enemy had taken advantage of it before it came to my knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>As no white flags were displayed from the right of <orgName n="Regiment"><persName n="Wilks,,,,," id="n0280.0003.00013.00239" reg="mostcommon:Wilks,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilks</surname></persName>' Regiment</orgName> to the fort, the enemy's batteries kept up their fire on this part of the line for some minutes after all firing had ceased on the left, and until they had taken possession of the fort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Both the officers and men of the command (with but few exceptions) exhibited commendable coolness and courage throughout the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Much credit is due <persName n="Swearengen,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0280.0003.00013.00240" reg="mostcommon:Swearengen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonels</roleName> <surname>Swearengen</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="24TXCav">24th Texas Cavalry</orgName>, and Nieland of the <num value="25" type="ordinal">25th</num>, and <persName n="Phillips,Major,,,," id="n0280.0003.00013.00241" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,James,E.,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6TXRegiment">6th Texas Regiment</orgName>, for the prompt and gallant manner in which they led the reinforcements from their respective regiments, ordered from the right to the extreme left of our line, under the heaviest fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>The General did not know the exact position of the point of attack, and the line of advance was oblique when it should have been direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>The disposition of the supports was equally faulty and they gave no aid, for lack of which the assault failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>Here the miry ground, tangled underbrush and briars and fallen timber somewhat impaired the alignment which increasing excitement, rising higher every moment which we thought would bring us into action, rendered it still more difficult for the officers to correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/>The <num value="24" type="ordinal">Twenty-fourth</num>, however, kept well together and continued to move rapidly on, but others to their right were not so quick and here began <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> to lose distance, having greater obstacles to pass, 'tis said, and finally lost their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>But the <num value="24" type="ordinal">Twenty-fourth</num> hurried ahead breathless now, for already we had gone half a mile or more, but still with all the strength we could muster; there was no halting or struggling&mdash;only more excitement and greater speed, though at each step less breath and more fatigue&mdash;and still no enemy to be seen, and where are the guns?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>Over the field from which we started we have run down the hill, through tangled, tripping briars and dense woods, crossed the road and up a slope and into woods again, and still no foe appears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>But now, at last, there is light ahead, the trees are fewer, and an open field is seen in front-surely the guns are there, and around them will be the enemy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>And now the enemy is in sight for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time is seen the battery we are after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>But the wild advance at such a speed over rough and heavy ground, has broken the line&mdash;the <num value="2">two</num> centre regiments do not appear at all, while the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC5">Fifth North Carolina</orgName> on the right does not get into the open until the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName> has been in close action some time and <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> was already driving the enemy before them, and when it does emerge 'tis far away to the right, and in rear of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n0280.0020.00115.01260" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:1"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>Thus, as it leaves the woods, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA24">Twenty-fourth Virginia</orgName>, alone and unsupported, with both flanks in the air, finds itself confronted by <num value="10">ten</num> guns, defended by <num value="5">five</num> regiments of infantry, with a strong redoubt in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>Clinging instinctively to the timber, bordering the field on its left flank, so as to mask its weakness as well as might be, and opening out its files to cover the foe's broad front, these fearless mountaineers break at once into the double and charge with a wild cheer that thrills through every heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>At once they are heavily engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>In opening their files several of the largest companies on the right became detached, and mistaking a redoubt held by <persName n="Bratton,Colonel,,,," id="n0280.0020.00115.01261" reg="mostcommon:Bratton,J.,R.,,:2"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Bratton</surname></persName> for the objective point, rushed towards it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>The advanced force delivered steady volleys at most uncumfortably short range, but soon give way, retreating towards the redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>As they retire, the guns, which have already been hurried back, again open; and these <persName n="Virginians,,,,," id="n0280.0020.00115.01262" reg="mostcommon:Virginians,nomatch:0"><surname>Virginians</surname></persName>, but a portion of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 24">Twenty-fourth Regiment</orgName>, weary and breathless, already shattered by shot and shell, receive <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n0280.0020.00115.01263" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,Winfield,Scott,,"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s whole fire of musketry, shell, grape and canister, as, pressing over the field with undaunted courage, they approach nearer and nearer the foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>A spirit of death or victory animates every bosom; and mindful of <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n0280.0020.00115.01264" reg="mostcommon:Early,Jubal,Anderson,,:6"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s advice, each <num value="1">one</num> anxious to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at these guns, they still press on, not so quickly, perhaps, as they would have done had they not been exhausted by their run through field and forest, but still without delay, and the enemy all the while gives way before them, though some of his regiments tarry longer than others.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>The leaden hail was fearful; it poured in from front and either flank, and for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time was heard the barbarous explosive bullet which the <rs>Yankees</rs> introduced and used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>The artillery, too, was well served, and soon both grape and canister were cutting through the wheat with a terribly suggestive sound, carrying down many a brave spirit, and men and officers fell dead and wounded on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>The field in their front was curtained with a heavy mist, as if kindly nature had sought to veil the appalling traces of the tragedy there enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>It had been sown with shot and bladed thick with steel on the previous afternoon, and the harvest of death was ungathered, lying in winnows along the ghastly furrows that had been cut by the red ploughshare of war. The infantry line stretched far away to the right, and their gray uniforms, blending with the hazy atmosphere, gave them a very shadowy appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Many of the regiments were indeed but shadows of what they had <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> been at <time value="12pm">noon</time> on the preceding day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>He was the beau-ideal of a cavalry commander; of tall, heroic form, a superb horseman, brave and enterprising without being rash, and with daring always tempered by sound judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>He was unquestionably the strongest man in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, and the only <num value="1">one</num> in either army who, enlisting as a private soldier, rose to the rank of lieutenant-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>But, although a judicious commander, he was possessed of a knightly spirit of adventure, and as adventures come to the adventurous, his brilliant military career was marked by many thrilling personal experiences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>But a brave heart is no buckler against a steel blade, as <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0280.0021.00123.01320" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> realized that morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>Hearing a bullet hiss just over his head, he turned his face toward the belt of open woods on his left in time to see the flash of a gun at a point about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> away, and then he heard another leaden messenger cut the air near him. He at once rode at a brisk trot in the direction of the timber to find out the early bird of the sharpshooters who thus broke upon the quiet of the morning with his shrill note of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>When he had ridden about <measure n="175yards" type="distance">one hundred and seventy-five yards</measure> at a <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> right oblique he came to a high stake-and-rider rail-fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Looking to the front he saw, standing on a large stump, some <num value="4">four</num> of <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> in height, a soldier, whose blue coat bound with orange-colored braid, and pantaloons with stripes of the same color on the outer seams, indicated that he was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Cavalryman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>He seemed to be what the <name>Scots</name> term a <q direct="unspecified">braw lad,</q> and, although not engaged in a political campaign, had <q direct="unspecified">taken the stump,</q> doubtless that he might get a better view of the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops on the elevated plateau south of the woods.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>The contour of the ground hid <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0280.0021.00124.01321" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> from his command when he halted at the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>As he drew his pistol the quick-eyed skirmisher saw him, and they both fired at the same instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1685"/>The ball from the soldiers' rifled carbine splintered a rail near the horses head, and that from <placeName key="tgn,2096866" n="1.000 1" reg="wade hampton, greenville, south carolina">Wade Hampton</placeName>'s <num value="44">44</num> calibre revolver made the bark fly from the stump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1686"/>The duel was clearly irregular, as there were no seconds, and the principals were about <measure n="125yards" type="distance">one hundred and twenty-five yards</measure> apart, instead of <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> paces, as prescribed by the code of honor, and they were unequally armed, although each was within fair range of the other's weapon.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>The soldier then inserted <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> cartridge, but could not close the breech of his rifle, the trouble evidently being that the gun was foul, and hence the butt of the metallic case did not go in flush with the socket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>He raised his right hand with the palm to the front, as if to say to his adversary: <q direct="unspecified">Wait a bit, I'll soon be with you,</q> and then drew his wiping rod, and, after driving out the stuck cartridge, took a piece of rag from his pocket, and, wetting it with his tongue, attached it to the slit in the rod, and deliberately cleaned out his carbine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>The delay sorely taxed the patience of <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0280.0021.00124.01323" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, as it would that of any gentleman who was kept waiting to be shot at.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>The high-roosting cock of the woods soon relieved him by again opening fire, but at <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s return shot the carbine fell from his grasp, and he jumped down, and, after picking it up with his left hand, retired to the rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>At that moment <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n0280.0021.00125.01324" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> received a blow on the back of his head that would have unhorsed a less stalwart rider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>He turned upon his assailant, who instantly wheeled his horse, and fled at full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>The fleeing Federal officer, for such his uniform stamped him, was also well mounted, but <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0280.0021.00125.01326" reg="nearbymention:Hampton,Wade,,,"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> overtook him, and levelling a pistol within <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> of his head, pulled trigger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>But the cap snapped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>Several times he pulled, but with the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>The Union officer bounded on, as if conscious of his peril.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>The bend in the fence prevented him from noticing my approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>Indeed, he was looking to the front as I came on his rear, and the ground being soft near the fence line, he did not hear my horse's step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>I would have run him through with my sword, but I was incapable of stabbing any man in the back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>I saw when I got near him that he was of formidable stature, and as his pistol was in his hand, I was sure that if I ordered him to surrender he would instantly turn and fire upon me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>Everything being in readiness, the <num value="600">600</num> passed out of the gate of the prison pen and were formed in <num value="2">two</num> ranks on the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>Ranks were opened, and what luggage the officers had and their clothing were thoroughly searched as a measure of precaution to prevent the carrying aboard the vessel contrabrand articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>The inspection being complete, we were marched to the wharf, where we found the <term type="ship">steamer</term>, <rs type="ship">Crescent City,</rs> ready for our reception and entertainment, such as it was. When the head of the column passed the gang-way, to our utter astonishment, the guards directed us to pass down a ladder leading from the hatchway into the hold of the vessel, instead of allowing us to go on deck, as we reasonably expected they would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>This hold, or <hi rend="italics">hole</hi>, was below the water-line, without light, and very imperfectly ventilated from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>Lines of shelves about <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> wide, projecting from the walls of the vessel, from the bottom to the floor above, and running around the entire space allotted to us, <num value="1">one</num> above the other, at a distance hardly sufficient to allow a man lying down to turn over, served as our berths or bunks, which were occupied by the officers lying head to foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>No seats were furnished, and the space, other than that taken up by the bunks, hardly afforded comfortable standing room for the <num value="600">600</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>We were guarded by onehun-dred-day, <q direct="unspecified"><num value="100">100</num> day,</q> soldiers, who had never seen service at the front, and who were devoid of the fellow feeling that characterizes <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> soldiers who have met each other on the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>This company of soldiers occupied the deck of the vessel, and besides a heavy guard kept on duty all the time on deck, a sentinel was posted at the foot of the ladder in the hold, where he could keep constant watch over the movements of the prisoners, and another sentinel was kept day and night at the hatch-way above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>There were taken with the <num value="602">600 two</num> mysterious characters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>They were Confederate colonels who had become galvanized, as it was termed in the prison, a considerable time before we left the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>It was believed that they had taken the oath of allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>However this may be, they were furnished with the blue blouse and pants of the <rs>Yankee</rs> soldier, which they wore before they left the fort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>They were treated with much consideration and accorded unusual privileges whilst on the island; among others, they were allowed to occupy a room in the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>After they donned the blue, the fort was unquestionably a safer place for them than the prison pen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was a Virginian and the other a North Carolinian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>Why they were included in the <num value="600">600</num> and taken on the expedition, we never knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>Some thought they were spies and others thought they would be exchanged on reaching <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, but they were not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>The <rs>Crescent</rs> was a side-wheel steamer which plied between New Orleans and <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName> before the war, and many of its crew were with the vessel then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>They were sympathizers with the <rs>South</rs>, and when they could escape the vigilance of the guards and sentinels, they would extend the prisoners such little favors as they were able.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>As a further safeguard against the escape of these helpless prisoners whilst the <rs>Crescent</rs> was coasting around to <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, from <num value="50">fifty</num> to a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> from land, the <rs>Government</rs> considerately furnished <num value="2">two</num> gun-boats as convoys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/><pb id="p.135" n="135"/></p> 
<p>But few of the <num value="600">600</num> had ever been to sea, and before we had proceeded far from the mouth of the <placeName reg="Delaware River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7020648">Delaware</placeName> great numbers became sea-sick.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>The water-closet used by the prisoners was in the wheel-house, to reach which it was necessary to go up the ladder, through the hatch and over the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>But <num value="1">one</num> prisoner was allowed to go to the closet at a time, and of course there was a great effort made to get a position to avoid delay, and to this end, every morning, nearly all of the <num value="600">600</num> would line themselves around the vessel in <num value="2">two</num> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>This was in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and the animal heat, which was greatly augmented by the heat from the smoke-stack, became so intolerable, and the smell of the place so offensive, that it was considered a great privilege to go to the water-closet for a few minutes, where <num value="1">one</num> could get a breath of fresh air and enjoy the spray thrown upon <num value="1">one</num>'s body by the paddlewheel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>Of course every man remained there until he was driven out by the sentinel, regardless of the suffering and clamor of his comrades in the hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>By this cruel arrangement it required hours to accommodate the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>Many of them were not able to stand up in ranks till their turn came, owing to their enfeebled condition caused by sea-sickness, which was aggravated by the heated and fetid air which they were compelled to breathe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>It frequently happened that men were not able to stand in line till their turn, and were compelled to fall out and rest, when the ranks would immediately close up, and this necessitated their going to the foot of the line, if they still desired the privilege of going on deck.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>In many instances these people were not able to control themselves, and were compelled to leave ranks and use <num value="1">one</num> end of the hold for their purposes.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Before the vessel reached <placeName reg="Cape Hatteras, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,3000601">Cape Hatteras</placeName> the floor of our department was a loblolly of vomit, ambier, &amp;c.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>We were provided with no means for cleaning the vessel, and the <rs>Federal</rs> officers in charge gave it no attention whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>When the vessel encountered the rougher waters off <placeName reg="Cape Hatteras, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,3000601">Cape Hatteras</placeName>, its rolling and pitching would dash and splatter this horrid combination of filth from <num value="1">one</num> end of the hold to the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>For <measure n="18days" type="date">eighteen days</measure> we were kept in this miserable place, which, notwithstanding the filth necessarily accumulating each day, was never cleaned; still we lived and were cheerful, buoyed by the hope of an early exchange and the thought of the loving greeting of the dear ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>Off <placeName reg="Cape Romain, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,1011106">Cape Romain</placeName> light-house the <rs>Crescent</rs> lost her convoys in a <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> fog and ran in near land and grounded on a bar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>We held a hasty <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName>, and determined to make a demand on the captain for the surrender of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>It was a desperate undertaking, as it would have been almost certain destruction if we had attempted to reach the deck under the concentrated fire of <num value="100">one hundred</num> muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>Through him we made the demand upon the captain for surrender, and, to the surprise of some of us, he agreed to surrender the vessel on condition, as I remember, that we would have the officers, crew, and soldiers exchanged at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 17" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>My recollection is that we had determined to make a landing in the life-boats at or near <placeName reg="Cape Romain, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,1011106">Cape Romain</placeName> light-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>While the preliminaries of surrender were being arranged, a signal gun was fired from <num value="1">one</num> of the escorts, and she quickly came in sight and steamed directly toward our vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>This untoward event terminated all further negotiations for surrender.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>The ruse was successful, as all on board were impressed with the belief that the <rs>Colonel</rs> had gone into the water and was drowned, as it would have been impossible for him to have made the shore by swimming, on account of the distance and the intervening breakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>We afterwards learned that in the confusion on board the vessel, a woman had concealed him in the linen room, of which she had charge and exclusive control, and fed and successfully concealed him until the vessel returned from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 17" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> to New York, whence he made good his escape to <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.143 000000.2851	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.0248	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, thence to his home in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, as we were afterwards informed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>Without further incident or delay, we reached <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> in due time, and the <rs>Crescent</rs> anchored inside the bar, close to the <rs>Federal</rs> blockading fleet and in sight of the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 17" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>Our anxiety was intense, as we fondly hoped and believed we were on the eve of exchange, and we fully expected that the preliminaries would be arranged without unreasonable delay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>Being surrounded by the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName>, with the monitors anchored between us and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 17" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, we thought it reasonable and expected to be allowed to go upon deck, but this privilege was denied us, and we <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> were forced to remain in our place in the hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>All the information we could get as to what was taking place in the harbor was what we could see in going to and from the wheel-house, and, for the purpose of observation, we kept a line of prisoners from the hold to the wheel-house all the time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>It was the day after our arrival, I think, that our hearts were gladdened by a report from deck, that a truce boat from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 17" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> and another from the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> were approaching each other, and in a very short time another report was brought from a faithful runner that the truce boats had met, later on, that they had separated, and that the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> vessel was steaming back to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 17" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and the other returning to the fleet, then expectation ran high among the prisoners, but the glad tidings of exchange did not reach us that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>I do not know whether they were negotiating for our exchange, but we thought so, and this thought revived our drooping spirits and caused us to forget, for the time, the horrible hell in the hold.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>It would hardly be expected that the rules of hospitality would be observed among a lot of half-starved prisoners, situated as we were, and it rarely happened that invitations to dinner were sent out to particular friends by the members of a mess which had been fortunate enough to capture a cat the night before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>These invitations were highly appreciated and the dish highly enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>It was a splendid take off, and must have been productive of good results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>A portion of these exhibitions were used in supplying the sick in the hospitals with delicacies and things necessary to their comfort, and in aiding officers in the pen who had no friends North to send them money or clothing, and the balance was divided among the members of the troupe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>I cannot here discuss at length the merits of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, but in justice to the memory of those who died in the struggle to maintain it, I wish to protest against the aspersion that they <pb id="p.362" n="362"/> fought to uphold and perpetuate the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5840"/></p> 
<p>With slavery thus fastened upon them by the force of circumstances, the <rs>Southern</rs> people sought to deal with it in the wisest and most humane way.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6051"/>The sentiments expressed by the orator of the day in his speech upon that occasion were so different from those expressed by Confederate veterans in many places, and notably in our own city of <placeName reg="Chicago, Cook, Illinois" key="tgn,7013596">Chicago</placeName>, that we were deeply moved, and cannot refrain from writing to inquire if these are the prevailing sentiments of the rank and file of Confederates South?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6056"/>And while anxious to look with pleasure upon these reunions in your sunny southland, we cannot but regret such disloyal sentiments as these, and must protest in the name of the fallen of both sides.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6067"/>dear Sir: Your letter of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, written on behalf of Columbia Post, though tempered somewhat by its kind assurances, was received by Lee Camp with great surprise, and still greater regret.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6068"/>We cannot suspect, still less do we charge, any purpose on your part to provoke sectional controversy or add fuel to the dying embers of sectional hate; but such seems to be its natural tendency, though we earnestly hope this may not prove its practical effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6069"/>You do not indicate what particular <q direct="unspecified">sentiments expressed by the orator of the day</q> moved Columbia Post so deeply, and we shall not go into any speculation on the subject, but we respectfully suggest that had they been more distasteful than they probably are, it would have been wiser and better in the real interest of peace and brotherly feeling if Columbia Post had pardoned something to the spirit of the place and the occasion, and passed them by without comment, at least to those who presumably approved them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6070"/>That those sentiments do not in all respects commend themselves to your judgement or feelings; that you may well and honestly differ from <persName n="Cave,Mister,,,," id="n0280.0029.00383.05926" reg="nearbymention:Cave,R.,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cave</surname></persName> and Lee Camp as to the facts&mdash;social, political and historical&mdash;on which they are founded, we can readily understand; but a careful examination of his oration, as reported, discloses no sentiment, which, fairly construed, is, or we believe was, intended <pb id="p.384" n="384"/> to be <q direct="unspecified">disloyal</q> to the existing Constitution, laws and government of our Union, and your <q direct="unspecified">protest</q> seems, therefore, not only unnecessary, but very uncalled for, albeit made <q direct="unspecified">in the name of the fallen of both sides.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6071"/></p> 
<p>There were indeed <num value="2">two</num> sides to that great question, which you say, and we fully admit, had its <q direct="unspecified">final settlement</q> at <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6072"/>But <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> was a battle-field, not a judicial forum, and that settlement, final and complete as we acknowledge it to have been, was made by weight of numbers and force of arms, and not by reason, judgment, or law. Physical might cannot determine the question of legal or moral right, and whether the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs> had right and law and justice on its side is still a disputed point, which can only be settled by the impartial judgment of posterity, when we who took part in that great contest, which cost so much of blood and treasure, and gave to the world such splendid examplars of the dignity, the worth, and the grandeur of man, have joined our comrades who now sleep in their honored graves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6073"/><quote>A decent respect to the opinions of mankind</quote> has impelled both sides, the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> as well, to set forth in historic records, in memorial orations, in song and story, the reasons which controlled their action; and both, to their honor, be it said, have reared monuments of bronze and marble to perpetuate the memory and deeds of those who nobly died for the cause they believed to be just.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6075"/>In like manner, as you know, Confederate veterans here and throughout the <rs>South</rs> have often laid their floral wreaths on the grass-grown mounds which mark the last resting-places of the brave soldiers who fought against them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6076"/>On such occasions we, too, but pay <q direct="unspecified">a willing tribute to the memory of brave men, in no wise referring to the cause for which they fell.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6077"/></p> 
<p>But we must remind you that <persName n="Cave,Mister,,,," id="n0280.0029.00384.05927" reg="nearbymention:Cave,R.,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cave</surname></persName> did not speak on any such occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6078"/>His oration was delivered at the unveiling of a monument to the private soldiers and sailors who died in behalf of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, in resistance to an armed invasion of their native land, and in defence, as they honestly believed, of their personal liberties and constitutional rights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6079"/>He spoke almost in sight of the graves of some <num value="7000">7,000</num> of those heroic men, almost in sight of the battle-fields once drenched with <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> their blood, and he spoke to their surviving comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6080"/>It was therefore meet and right that he should not only pay a <q direct="unspecified">tribute to the memory of brave men,</q> who gave their lives in defence of their firesides and their homes, but that he should also refer to and vindicate <q direct="unspecified">the cause for which they fell.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6081"/></p> 
<p>He spoke of the past, not of the present; of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as our fathers framed it, and not of that Constitution as amended by the mailed hand of war, and Lee Camp emphatically answers that it endorses the statements made in his oration, in justification of the course of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, when, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, they took up arms to maintain the rights and liberties guaranteed to them and their people by the <rs>Constitution</rs> as then framed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6083"/><hi rend="italics">Esto perpetua</hi>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6084"/>In the war for our independence no traitor, so far as we know, was bred on Southern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6085"/>There were many rebels until <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> stamped the seal of success on the <name>Colonial</name> cause, when the rebel became the patriot!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6086"/>But success, dear sir, is not the touchstone by which the motives or conduct of men can be rightly tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6087"/>As <persName n="Cave,Mister,,,," id="n0280.0029.00385.05929" reg="nearbymention:Cave,R.,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cave</surname></persName> well said, though not intending the inference you have probably drawn, <q direct="unspecified">Suwaroff triumphed and a Kosciusko fell.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6088"/>The monument unveiled in this city on the <dateStruct value="-05-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last was not erected in honor of traitors or rebels, but to perpetuate the memory of brave men and true, who knew their rights and died in defending them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6089"/>According to the people of the <rs>North</rs>, perfectly honest in the views they entertained and the course they pursued, we claim for ourselves motives as honorable and as pure.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6091"/>We gladly note you remember the kind feelings with which Lee Camp met the veterans of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> on a former occasion, and we indulge the hope that you will not permit forced constructions of isolated sentences in the speech to which you refer, detached from their context and misinterpreted, to lessen the mutual friendship and respect which we should feel for each other as soldiers, or weaken the <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> ties which should bind us together as true and loyal citizens of our beloved and now happily-united country.</p>
