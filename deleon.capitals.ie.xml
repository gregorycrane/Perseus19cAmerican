<head>In place of preface.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Fortunate, indeed, is the reader who takes up a volume without preface; of which the persons are left to enact their own drama and the author does not come before the curtain, like the chorus of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> tragedy, to speak for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>But, in printing the pages that follow, it may seem needful to ask that they be taken for what they are; simple sketches of the inner life of <quote>Rebeldom</quote> --behind its <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> wall of wood and steel &mdash; during those unexampled <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of its existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Written almost immediately after the war, from notes and recollections gathered during its most trying scenes, these papers are now revised, condensed and formulated for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>In years past, some of their crude predecessors have appeared &mdash; as random articles &mdash; in the columns of the <rs>Mobile</rs> <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Sunday Times" type="newspaper">Sunday Times</orgName></hi>, <persName n="Appleton,,,,," id="n0014.0001.00005.00004" reg="mostcommon:Appleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Appleton</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi>, the <orgName n="Louisville Courier-Journal" type="newspaper">Louisville <hi rend="italics">Courier-Journal</hi></orgName>, the <rs>Philadelphia</rs> <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> and other publications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Even in their present condensation and revision, they claim only to be simple memoranda of the result of great events; and of their reaction upon the mental and moral tone of the southern people, rather than a record of those events themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This volume aspires neither to the height of history, nor to the depths of political analysis; for it may still be too early for either, or for both, of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Equally has it resisted temptation to touch on many topics &mdash; not strictly belonging inside the <rs>Southern Capitalsstill</rs> vexed by political agitation, or personal interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These, if unsettled by dire arbitrament of the sword, must be left to Time and his best coadjutor, <quote>sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-thought.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/></p> 
<p>Campaigns and battles have already surfeited most readers; and their details-usually so incorrectly stated by the inexpert &mdash; have little to do with a relation of things within the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, as they then appeared to the masses of her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Such, therefore, are simply touched upon in outline, where necessary to show their reaction upon the popular pulse, or to correct some flagrant error regarding that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>To the vast majority of those without her boundaries &mdash; to very many, indeed, within them-realities of the <rs>South</rs>, during the war, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> were a sealed book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>False impressions, on many important points, were disseminated; and these, because unnoted, have grown to proportions of accepted truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A few of them, it may not yet be too late to correct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>While the pages that follow fail not to record some weaknesses in our people, or some flagrant errors of their leaders, they yet endeavor to chronicle faithfully heroic constancy of men, and selfless devotion of women, whose peers the student of History may challenge that vaunting <persName n="Muse,,,,," id="n0014.0001.00006.00005" reg="mostcommon:Muse,nomatch:0"><surname>Muse</surname></persName> to show. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>To prejudiced provincialism, on the <num value="1">one</num> side, they may appear too lukewarm; by stupid fanaticism on the other, they may be called treasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But-written without prejudice, and equally without fear, or favor &mdash; they have aimed only at impartial truth, and at nearest possible correctness of narration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Indubitably the war proved that there were great men, on both the sides to it; and, to-day, the little men on either--<quote><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> profit by their example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If <hi rend="italics">this</hi> be treason, make the most of it!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/></p> 
<p>The sole object kept in view was to paint honestly the inner life of the <rs>South</rs>; the general tone of her people, under strain and privation unparalleled; the gradual changes of society and character in the struggling nation &mdash; in a clear, unshaded outline of <hi rend="italics">things as they were</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Should this volume at all succeed in giving this; should it uproot <num value="1">one</num> false impression, to plant a single true <num value="1">one</num> in its place, then has it fully equaled the aspiration of </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The cloud no bigger than a man's hand had risen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It became visible to all in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> over the southern horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>All around to <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> was but the dull, dingy line of the storm that was soon to burst in wild fury over that section, leaving only seared desolation in its wake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Already the timid and wary began to take in sail and think of a port; while the most reckless looked from the horizon to each other's faces, with restless and uneasy glances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the days of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, as everybody knows, the society of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName> was composed of <num value="2">two</num> distinct circles, tangent at no <num value="1">one</num> point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The larger, outer circle whirled around with crash and fury several months in each year; then, spinning out its centrifugal force, flew into minute fragments and scattered to extreme ends of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The smaller <num value="1">one</num>--the inner circle-revolved sedately in its accustomed grooves, moving no whit faster for the buzz of the monster that surrounded and half hid it for so long; and when that spun itself to pieces moved on as undisturbed as Werther's Charlotte. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The outer circle drew with it all the outside population, all the <quote>dwellers in tents,</quote> from the busiest lobbyman to the laziest lookeron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>All the <quote>hotel people</quote> --those caravans that yearly poured unceasing into the not too comfortable <hi rend="italics">caravanserai</hi> down town &mdash; stretched eager hands toward this circle; for, to them, it meant <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Having clutched an insecure grasp upon its rim, away they went with a fizz and a spin, dizzy and delighted-devil take the hindmost!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Therein did the <num value="1000">thousand</num> lobbyists, who yearly came to roll logs, pull wires and juggle through bills, find their congenial prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><pb id="p.12" n="12"/> </p> 
<p>Who shall rise up and write the secret history of that wonderful committee and of the ways and means it used to prey impartially upon government and client?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Who shall record the <quote>deeds without a name,</quote> hatched out of eggs from the midnight terrapin; the strange secrets drawn out by the post-prandial corkscrew?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Who shall justly calculate the influence the lobby and its workings had in hastening that inevitable, the war between the states? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Into this outer circle whirled that smaller element which came to the <rs>Capital</rs> to spend money &mdash; not to make it. Diamonds flash, point lace flounces flaunt!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Who will stop that mighty whirligig to inspect whether the champagne is real, or the turtle is prime? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><foreign lang="fr">Allons! le jeu est fait!</foreign> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Camp-followers and hangers &mdash; on of Congress, many of its members from the <rs>West</rs>, claim agents from <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, husbandless married women from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> and subterranean politicians from everywhere herein found elements as congenial as profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All stirred into the great <hi rend="italics">olla podrida</hi> and helped to <quote>Make the hell broth boil and bubble.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/></p> 
<p>The inner circle was the real society of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Half submerged for half of each year by accumulating streams of strangers, it ever rose the same-fresh and unstained by deposit from the baser flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Therein, beyond doubt, <num value="1">one</num> found the most cultured coteries, the courtliest polish and the simplest elegance that the drawing-rooms of this continent could boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The bench and the bar of the highest court lent their loftiest intellects and keenest wits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Careful selections were there from Congress of those who held senates on their lips and kept together the machinery of an expanding nation; and those <quote>rising men,</quote> soon to replace, or to struggle with them, across the narrow Potomac near by. To this society, too, the foreign legations furnished a strong element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Bred in courts, familiar with the theories of all the world, these men must prove valuable and agreeable addition to any society into which they are thrown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is rather the fashion just now to inveigh against foreigners in society, to lay at their door many of the peccadilloes that have crept into our city life; but the diplomats are, with rare exceptions, men of birth, education and of proved ability in their own homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Their ethics may be less strict than those which obtain about <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName>, but experience with them will prove that, however loose their <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> own code, they carefully conform to the custom of others; that if they have any scars across their morals, they have also the tact and good taste to keep them decorously draped from sight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In the inner circle of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> were those officers of the army and navy, selected for ability or service-or possibly <quote>by grace of cousinship</quote> --to hold posts near the government; and, with full allowance for favoritism, some of these were men of culture, travel and attainment-most of them were gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>And the nucleus, as well as the amalgam of all these elements, was the resident families of old Washingtonians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>These had lived there so long as to be able to winnow the chaff and throw the refuse off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There has ever been much talk about the corruption of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, easy hints about <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName>, with a general sweep at the depravity of its social system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But it is plain these facile fault-finders knew no more of its inner circle-and for its resident society only is any city responsible-than they did of the court of the <rs>Grand Turk</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Such critics had come to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, had made their <quote>dicker,</quote> danced at the hotel hops, and been jostled on the <rs type="place">Avenue</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>If they essayed an entrance into the charmed circle, they failed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Year after year, even the <name>Titans</name> of the lobby assailed the gates of that heaven refused them; and year after year they fell back, baffled and grommelling, into the pit of that outer circle whence they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Yet every year, especially in the <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs>, behind that <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName> wall was a round of entertainments less costly than the crushes of the critic circle, but stamped with quiet elegance aped in vain by the non-elect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>And when the whirl whirled outf at last, with the departing Congress; when the howling crowd had danced its mad <hi rend="italics">carmagnole</hi> and its vulgar echoes had died into distance, then <orgName n="Washington Society" type="society">Washington society</orgName> was itself again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Then the sociality of intercoursethat peculiar charm which made it so unique-became once more free and unrestrained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Passing from the reek of a hotel ball, or the stewing soiree of a Cabinet secretary into the quiet <hi rend="italics">salon</hi> of a West End home, the very atmosphere was different, and comparison came of itself with that old <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Quartier</foreName></persName> <placeName reg="Saint Germain, Vilas, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2122314">Saint Germain</placeName></hi>, which kept undefiled from the pitch that smirched its <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, through all the hideous dramas of the <hi rend="italics">bonnet rouge</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The influence of political place in this country has long spawned a social degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Where the gift is in the hands of a fixed power, <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> its seeking is lowering enough; but when it is besought from the enlightened voter himself, <quote>the scurvy politician</quote> becomes a reality painfully frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Soliciting the ballot over a glass of green corn juice in the back room of a country grocery, or flattering the <hi rend="italics">cara sposa</hi> of the farmhouse, with squalling brat upon his knee, is scarcely calculated to make the best.of men more of <quote>an ornament to society.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Constant contact with sharpers and constant effort to be sharper than they is equally as apt to blunt his sense of delicacy as it is to unfit <num value="1">one</num> for higher responsibilities of official station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>So it was not unnatural that that society of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, based wholly on politics, was not found wholly clean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But under the seething surface-<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visible to the casual glance &mdash; was a substratum as pure as it was solid and unyielding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><foreign lang="fr">Habitues</foreign> of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> remarked that, with all the giddy whirl of previous winters in the outer circle, none had approached in mad rapidity that of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">6</year></dateStruct> . The rush of aimless visiting, matinees and dinners, balls and suppers, followed each other without cessation; dress and diamonds, equipage and cards, all cost more than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This might be the last of it, said an uneasy sense of the coming storm; and in the precedent sultriness, the <num value="1000">thousands</num> who had come to make money vied with the tens who came to spend it in mad distribution of the proceeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><rs type="role2">Madame</rs>, who had made an immense investment of somebody's capital in diamonds and lace, must let the world see them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><persName><foreName>Mademoiselle</foreName></persName> must make a certain exhibit of shapely shoulders and of telling stride in the <name>German</name>; and time was shortening fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>And <persName n="Knower,,,,," id="n0014.0002.00014.00008" reg="mostcommon:Knower,nomatch:0"><surname>Knower</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Third House</rs>, had put all the proceeds of engineering that last bill through, into gorgeous plate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It would never do to waste it, for <persName n="Knower,,,,," id="n0014.0002.00014.00009" reg="mostcommon:Knower,nomatch:0"><surname>Knower</surname></persName> meant business; and this might be the end of the thing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>So the stream rushed on, catching the weak and timid ones upon its brink and plunging them into the whirling vortex.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>And still the rusty old wheels revolved, as creakily as ever, at the <rs>Capital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Blobb, of <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, made machine speeches to the sleepy <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName>, but neither he, nor they, noted the darkening atmosphere without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><persName n="Jenks,Senator,,,," id="n0014.0002.00014.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jenks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Jenks</surname></persName> took his half-hourly <quote>&lsquo;nip</quote> with laudable punctuality, thereafter rising eloquent to call <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President's</rs> attention to that little bill; and all the while that huge engine, the lobby, steadily pumped away in the political basement, sending streams of hot corruption into every artery of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><pb id="p.15" n="15"/> </p> 
<p>Suddenly a sullen reverberation echoes over the <rs>Potomac</rs> from the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The long-threatened deed is done at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has seceded, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> link is rudely stricken from the chain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>There is a little start; that is all. The <placeName reg="Third House">Third House</placeName> stays for a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> its gold spoon; and, perhaps, a trifle of the turtle spills before reaching its mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/><rs type="role2">Madame</rs> rearranges her parure and smoothes her ruffled lace; while <persName><foreName>Mademoiselle</foreName></persName> pouts a little, then studies her card for the next waltzer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>As for the lobby-pump, its piston grows red-hot and its valves fly wide open, with the work it does; while thicker and more foul are the streams it sends abroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>For awhile there is some little talk around <persName n="Willard,,,,," id="n0014.0002.00015.00012" reg="mostcommon:Willard,nomatch:0"><surname>Willard</surname></persName>'s about the <quote>secesh;</quote> and the old soldiers wear grave faces as they pass to and fro between the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and <placeName><persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0014.0002.00015.00013" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But to the outer circle, it is only a <num value="9">nine</num>-day wonder; while the dancing and dining army men soon make light of the matter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>But the stone the surface closes smoothly over at the center makes large ripples at the edges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Faces that were long before now begin to lengthen; and thoughtful men wag solemn heads as they pass, or pause to take each other by the buttonhole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>More frequent knots discuss the status in hotel lobbies and even in the passages of the departments; careful non-partisans keep their lips tightly closed, and hot talk, <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> or <hi rend="italics">con</hi>, begins to grow more popular. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>As we plunged into the low, close cabin of the <rs type="place">Acquia Creek</rs> steamer of that day, there was a weak light, but a strong smell of kerosene and whisky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Wet, steamy men huddled around the hot stove, talking blatant politics in terms as strong as their liquor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>So, leaving the reek below, we faced the storm on deck, vainly striving to fix the familiar city lights as they faded through the mist and rain; more vainly still peering into the misty future, through driving fancies chasing each other in the brain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The journey south in those days was not a delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Its components were discomfort, dust and doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>As we rattled through at gray of dawn, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was fast asleep, blissfully ignorant of that <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> morning when she would wake to find herself famous, with the eyes of all the civilized world painfully strained toward her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Anxious knots were at every station and water tank, and not overclean hands were thrust into the windows, with the cry: <quote>Airy paper?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Sometimes yellow faces, framed with long, lank hair, peered in at the doors; while occasional voices indescribably twanged: <quote>You'uns got any news from thar &lsquo;nauggeration?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/></p> 
<p>Staple's ready, while not very accurate, replies were hungrily swallowed; proffered papers of any date were clutched and borne as prizes to the learned man of each group, to be spelled out to the delectation of open-mouthed listeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>For the whole country had turned out, with its hands in its breeches pockets, and so far it seemed content to gape and lounge about the stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The men, to all appearance, were ready and eager; but at that time no idea of such a thing as preparation had entered their minds. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It is difficult, at best, to overcome the <foreign lang="la">vis inertiae</foreign> of the lower-class dweller along the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">South Atlantic</placeName> seaboard; but when he is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> knocked in the head with so knotty a club as secession, and then is told to be up and doing, he probably does &mdash; nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The average intelligence of the masses thereabout is not high; the change noticeable before crossing the <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> line becoming more and more marked as <num value="1">one</num> travels straight south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>There was more general sense of a crisis upon them; but the escape valve for extra steam, generated therefrom, seemed to be in talk only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>There were loud-mouthed groups about the hotel, sundry irate and some drunken politicians at the ferry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>A strongly asseverated wish to do something, and that at the earliest moment, was generally clinched by a bouncing oath; but where, or how, that something was to be done was never even hinted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Briefly, Georgia <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> seemed more anxious for preparation than her neighbors; withal she was equally far from preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>It were manifestly unfair to judge the status of a whole people by glimpses from a railway carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Slowness of organization, the weakness of Congress, secession of the border states, personnel of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> and especially the latest army appointments-these and kindred subjects were canvassed with heat equaled only by ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>There had always been considerable culture, more hospitality and still more ambition, social and civic; but there was still much lacking of what the world expects of a city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Now, however, a future loomed up before the town, which had never before crossed the dreams of its oldest inhabitant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Her choice as the <quote>cradle of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>,</quote> the sudden access of population therefrom, the probable erection of furnaces, factories and storehouses, with consequent disbursement of <num value="1000000">millions</num>-all these gave the humdrum town a new value and importance, even to its humblest citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Already small merchants saw their ledgers grow in size, to the tune of added cash to fall jingling into enlarged tills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>In fact, the choice of the <rs>Capital</rs> had turned a society, provincially content to run in accustomed grooves, quite topsy-turvy; and, perhaps for want of some other escape-valve under the new pressure, the townspeople grumbled consumedly. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The proposition that, shown who writes the ballads of a country, <num value="1">one</num> may tell who makes its laws, is far from reversible in many instances; and assuredly the lawmakers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> looked little like poets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>When the councils of a country are assembled for work, it is but natural to look for a body of grave and reverend &mdash; if not most potent-seigniors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>And especially, when a new government is forming from selected fragments of the old, might <num value="1">one</num> expect a pure and simple structure, free from those faults and weaknesses which sowed the seeds of disintegration in the elder fabric. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>It was too much the fashion to believe that the <name>Confederacyhaving</name> sprung full-grown from foam of the angry sea of politicswas full-armed as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>A revolution, unprecedented in the world's history, had already been achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>A strongly cemented and firmly seated government had been disrupted; and a new <num value="1">one</num>, built from the dissevered fragments, had been erected almost under the shadow of its <address><street n="Capitol square">Capitol</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>And no drop of blood had been spilled!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/><num value="6000000">Six millions</num> of people had uprisen and, by a simple declaration of will, had in a few short weeks undone the work of near a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Without arms in their hands; without a keel in their waters; without a dollar in their treasury, they arrayed themselves against the mother government with the serious purpose of not only asserting, but maintaining, their independence of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>So far, all had been, accomplished without violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But, whatever the simpler masses might expect, the initiated politician could scarce have believed that the older government would meekly submit to <quote>Let the erring sisters go in peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Hence, <num value="1">one</num> might justly have looked to see the <orgName n="Executive Council" type="council">executive council</orgName> of the new nation-to whom had been intrusted its safety and its hopes &mdash; with every thought bent, every nerve strained to the <num value="1">one</num> vital point-preparation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/><num value="1">One</num> <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> could only have expected measures simple as energetic; laws clear, concise and comprehensive; care only for the arming, organizing and maintenance of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Blessed are they who expect nothing!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The states went out of the union, separately and at different periods, by the action of conventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>These were naturally composed of men who had long been prominently before the people, urging the measures of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>As a matter of course, the old political workers of each section, by fair means and foul, were enabled to secure election to these conventions; and, once there, they so fevered and worked upon the public mind, amid rapidly succeeding events, that its after-thought could neither be reasonable nor deliberate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The act of secession once consummated, the state connected itself with the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and representatives had to be sent to <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Small wonder that the men most prominent in the secession conventions should secure their own election, as little regard to fitness as ability being had by the excited electors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> looked like the <orgName n="Washington Congress" type="congress">Washington Congress</orgName>, viewed through a reversed <rs n="opera glass" type="product">opera-glass</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The same want of dignity and serious work; the same position of ease, with feet on desk and hat on head; the sane buzzing talk on indifferent subjects; often the very same men in the lobbies-taking dry smokes from unlit cigars; all these elements were there in duplicate, if somewhat smaller and more concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>No point in <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> was remote enough &mdash; no assemblage dignified enough &mdash; to escape the swoop of the lobby vulture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>His beak was as sharp and his unclean talons as strong as those of the traditional bird, which had blinked and battened so long on the eaves of the <rs>Washington</rs> edifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>When <quote>the old concern</quote> had been dismembered, limbs had been dragged whole to aid in the construction of the new giant; and scenting these from afar, he hastened hither fierce for his fresh banquet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Glancing down from the gallery of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, many were the familiar faces peering over the desks; and, even where <num value="1">one</num> did not know the individual, it was easy to recognize the politician by trade among the rosy and uncomfortable novices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It was constant food <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> for wonderment to thoughtful men, that the <rs>South</rs> had, in most cases, chosen party hacks to legislate for and to lead her in this great crisis, rather than transfused younger blood and steadier nerves into her councils; rather than grafted new minds upon the as yet healthy body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The revolution was popularly accepted as the result of corruptions and aggressions which these very men had been utterly helpless to correct, or to prevent; even had they not been able actors in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Yet, worn-out politicians &mdash; who had years before been <quote>promoted from servants to sovereigns and had taken back seats</quote> --floated high upon the present surge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Men hot from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, reeking with the wiles of the old <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName> and with their unblushing buncombe fresh upon them, took the lead in every movement; and the rank old <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> leaven threatened to permeate every pore of the new government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It is small wonder that the measures of such a congress, when not vacillating, were weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>If the time demanded anything, that demand was the promptest organization of an army, with an immediate basis of foreign credit, to arm, equip and clothe it. Next to this was the urgent need for a simple and readily managed machinery in the different departments of the government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Neither of these desiderata could be secured by their few earnest and capable advocates, who thrust them forward over and over again, only to be pushed aside by the sensation element with which the popular will of the new nation-or the want of it-had diluted her councils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>There were windy dissertations on the color of the flag, or on the establishment of a <orgName n="Patent Office" type="office">patent office</orgName>; and members made long speeches, bearing on no special point, but that most special <num value="1">one</num> of their own re-election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>There were bitter denunciations of <quote>the old wreck;</quote> violent diatribes on the <quote>gridiron</quote> flag; with many an eloquent and manly declaration of the feelings and the attitude of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>But these were not the bitter need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Declarations sufficient had already been made; and the masses-having made them, and being ready and willing to maintain them-stood with their hands in their pockets, open-mouthed, eager, but inactive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>They were waiting for some organization, for some systematized preparation for the struggle even they felt to be surely coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="3">three</num> of the congressmen dared look the real issue directly in the face; and these were powerless to accomplish anything practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>But their constant <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> pressure finally forced from the reluctant legislature a few <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steps toward reduction of the chaos. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The Government was to consist, after the <rs>President</rs>, of a vice-President and a secretary for each of the departments of State, War, Navy, Treasury, <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-Office</orgName> and Justice; the latter being a combination of the responsibilities of the <orgName n="Interior Department" type="department">Interior Department</orgName> and the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>'s office</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>He had long been a prominent politician; was thoroughly acquainted with all the points of public life; and was, at this time, quite popular with people of all sections, being generally regarded as a man of exceptional capacity and great independence. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>This was the popular view of that day at the new Capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The country at large had but little means of knowing the real stuff of which the <rs>Cabinet</rs> was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The other half felt: that, however fair an augury for the future the great and bloodless victory might be-and it will be recollected that the only loss was the death of a few <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> soldiers, in the salute <rs>Beauregard</rs> permitted them to give their flag &mdash; the real tug of the struggle was not yet commenced; that the whole power of a government, never yet overstrained, or even fully tested, would be hurled on the new confederation, to crush ere it could concentrate its strength. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Bureaux of <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, Ordnance, Engineers and Medicine were soon put in as perfect a state as the condition of the <rs>South</rs> allowed; and their respective chiefs were tireless in endeavor to collect the very best assistants and material, in their various branches, from every quarter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Commissioners were sent to all the states that had not already joined the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, to urge them to speedy action; and the dispatches they sent back were so full of cheer, that day after day a salute of cannon from the street in front of the <rs type="place">Government House</rs> announced to the roused <rs>Montgomerans</rs> that another ally had enlisted under the flag; or, that a fresh levy of troops, from some unexpected quarter, had been voted to the cause. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>His habits were as simple as laborious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Often, long after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, the red glow from his office lamp, shining over the mock-orange hedge in front of his dwelling, told of unremitting strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The secretaries were, of course, useful to arrange matters formally in their respective branches; but they had scarcely higher duties left them than those of their clerks; while Congress remained a formal body to pass bills and ratify acts, the inspiration for which it derived from the clearest and coolest brain in the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>The crisis had called in plain terms that it was time for the leading spirit of the revolution to take its management; and he had risen to the occasion and faced the responsibilities, before which the chosen of the new nation had hitherto cowered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>And naturally, under the iron hand, things began to work more smoothly than they had under the <rs>King-Log</rs> reign of a few weeks previous; and the country felt the change from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>True, politicians still grumbled, but less loudly; for even they found something to do, where everybody began to be busy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Her length was immense, and her draught necessarily very light &mdash; not <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> when full loaded; for the <rs>Alabama</rs> is subject to many vagaries and what was a clear channel yesterday may be only a <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 2">two-foot</orgName> shoal to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>Of course, with solidity and strength sacrificed to this extreme lightness, when the powerful engines are put to any strain, the high, thin fabric thrills from stem to stern with their every puff, like a huge card-house. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>With every gesture of anxious haste and eyeballs starting from their dusky heads, some plunge the long <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> rakes into the red mouths of the furnace, twisting and turning the crackling mass with terrific strength; others hurl in huge logs of resinous pine, already heated by contact till they burn like pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The day after the race our trio exhausted all usual resources of boat life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>We lounged in the saloon and saw the young ladies manage their beaux and the old ones their children; dropped into the card-rooms and watched the innocent games &mdash; some heavy ones of <quote>draw poker</quote> with a <quote>bale better;</quote> some light ones of <quote>all fours,</quote> with only an occasional old sinner deep in chess, or solitaire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>For cards, conversation, tobacco, yarns and the bar make up boat life; it being rare, indeed, that the <hi rend="italics">ennui</hi> is attacked from the barricade of a book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Then we roamed below and saw the negroes-our demons of the night before, much modified by sunlight-tend the fires and load cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>A splendidly developed race are those Africans of the river boats, with shiny, black skins, through which the corded and tense muscles seem to be bursting, even in repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Their only dress, as a general thing, is a pair of loose pantaloons, to which the more elegant add a fancy colored bandanna knotted about the head, with its wing-like ends flying in the wind; but shirts are a rarity in working hours and their absence shows a breadth of shoulder and depth of chest remarkable, when contrasted with the length and lank power in the nether limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>They are a perfectly careless and jovial race, with wants confined to the only luxuries they know-plenty to eat, a short pipe and a plug of <quote>nigger-head,</quote> with occasional drinks, of any kind and quantity that fall to their lot. Given these, they are as contented as princes; and their great eyes roll like white saucers and their splendid teeth flash in constant merriment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>As we got further down the river, the flats became less frequent and high, steep bluffs took their place; and at every landing along these we laid-by for cotton and took in considerable quantities of <quote>the king.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/></p> 
<p>Some of the bluffs were from <num value="60">sixty</num> to <measure n="80feet" type="distance">eighty feet</measure> in height; and down these, the cotton came on slides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>These, in most cases, were <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> at an angle of <num value="45">forty-five</num> degrees, or less; strongly constructed of heavy beams, cross-tied together and firmly pegged into the hard bluff-clay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>A small, solid platform at the bottom completed the slide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Scarcely would the plank be run out when the heavy bales came bounding down the slide, gaining momentum at every yard of descent, till at the bottom they had the velocity of a cannon-ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The dexterity and strength of the negroes were here wonderfully displayed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Standing at the edge of the boat-or at the foot of the slide, as the conformation of the landing indicated-heavy cotton-hook in hand, they watch the descending bale, as it bounds fiercely toward them; and just at the right moment <num value="2">two</num> men, with infinite dexterity of hand and certainty of eye, strike their hooks firmly into the bagging-holding on to the plunging mass and going with it halfway across the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Full in front of it <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> stands, like a <hi rend="italics">matador</hi> ready for the blow; and striking his hook deep in the end, by a sudden and simultaneous twist the <num value="3">three</num> stand the bale upon end. Once stopped, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> more jerks of the hooks and it is neatly stowed away alongside, or on top of, its fellows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/><num value="1">One</num> constantly sees huge bales of from <num value="5">five</num> to <measure n="600l." type="pounds"><num value="600">six hundred</num> pounds</measure> bound down a slide <measure n="80feet" type="distance">eighty feet</measure> high-scarcely touching the rail more than <num value="3">three</num> times in their steep descent-looking almost round from the rapidity of their motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Yet <num value="2">two</num> negroes drive their hooks into, and spin along with them; visibly checking their speed, till the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> <num value="1">one</num> <quote>heads up</quote> and stops them still, in half a boat's width. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Sometimes a hook slips, the bagging gives, or the footing yields, when the mixed mass of man and bale rolls across the boat and goes under together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>But frightful as it looks to unaccustomed eyes, a more serious accident than a ducking seldom occurs; and at that, the banks resound with the yells of laughter <persName><foreName>Sambo</foreName></persName> sends after his brother-in-water. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>With which paternal admonition we ascended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The professor was still in a deep sleep; having been transferred by the aid of a deck hand, or <num value="2">two</num>, to his bower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>This was a box of a <rs n="state room" type="product">state-room</rs> <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> by <num value="9">nine</num>, in which was a most dilapidated doublebass, a violin case and a French horn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>Over the berth, a cracked guitar hung by a greasy blue ribbon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Staple waked him without ceremony-ordered Congress water, pulled out the instruments; and soon we were in <quote>a concord of sweet sounds,</quote> the like of which the mermaids of the <rs>Alabama</rs> had not heard before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Suddenly, in the midst of a roaring chorus, there was a short, heavy jar that sent us pellmell across the <rs n="state room" type="product">state-room</rs>; then a series of grinding jolts; and, amid the yelling of orders, jangling of bells and backing of the wheels, the boat swung slowly round by the bows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>We were hard and fast aground! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Of all the unpleasant episodes of river travel, the worst by far is to be grounded in the daytime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The dreary monotony of bank and stream as you glide by increases <num value="10">ten</num>-fold when lying, hour after hour, with nothing to do but gaze at it. Under this trial the jolliest faces grow long and dismal; quiet men become dreadfully blue and the saturnine look actually suicidal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Even the negro hands talk under their breath, and the broad <hi rend="italics">Yah</hi>! <hi rend="italics">Yah</hi> comes less frequently from below decks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Here we lay, <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> above Selma</placeName>-hard and fast, with engines and anchors equally useless to move us a foot-until <time value="12am">midnight</time>. About sundown an up-boat passed just across our bows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>Little is the sympathy a grounded boat gets unless actually in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Every <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> soul aboard of her, from captain to cook's boy, seemed to think us fair game, and chaff of all kinds was hailed from her decks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>But she threw us a Selma paper of that evening, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> eager hands were stretched over the side to catch it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>It fell at the feet of a slight, wiry man of about <num value="50">fifty</num>, with twinkling gray eyes, prominent features and fierce gray moustache.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>There was something in his manner that kept the more ardent ones from plucking it out of his fingers, as he stooped quietly to pick it up; but few on board ever knew that their quiet fellow-passenger was the most widely known <quote>rebel of them all.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/><placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> was in a state of perfect ferment when we arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The news from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had made profound sensation and had dissipated the delusive hopes-indulged there as well as in Montgomery-like mists before the sun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>All now agreed that war must come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Many thought it already upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Groups, anxious and steadfast, filled the hotels, the clubs and the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>; and the sense of all was that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had spoken not <num value="1">one</num> hour too soon; having spoken, the simple duty of the <rs>South</rs> was to prevent harm to a hair of her head for words said in its defense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Those who had been the hottest in branding the action of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> as laggard, looked to her for the steadiest and most efficient aid, now that the crisis faced them; while all felt she would meet the calls of the hour with never a pause for the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>The sanguine counted on <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, bound by every community of interest, every tie of sympathy &mdash; as already <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>She was no longer neutral, they said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>She had put her lance in rest and rallied to the charge, in the avowed quarrel that the troops attacked were on their way to oppress her next sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>And nothing could follow but <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s bright falchion must flash out, and the states must lock shields and press between her and the giant she had roused. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The <rs type="place">Gulf City</rs> had not been idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The echo of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> had roused her people; and with a wonderful accord they had sprung to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Law books were thrown aside, merchants locked up their ledgers, even students of theology forgot that they were men of peace-and all enrolled themselves in the <quote>crack</quote> companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>No wonder, when the very best blood of the state ran in the veins of the humblest private; when men of letters and culture and wealth refused any but <quote>the post of honor,</quote> with musket <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> on shoulder; when the most delicate fingers of their fairest worked the flags that floated over them, and the softest voices urged them tot their <hi rend="italics">devoir</hi>; no wonder, then, that high on the roll of fame are now written the names of the <rs>Mobile Cadets</rs> &mdash; of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> <orgName n="City Guards" type="guards">City Guards</orgName>--of the Rifles-and enough others to make the list as long as; Leporello's. Not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="10">ten</num> of the best born youth of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> remained at home; the mechanics, the stevedores and men of every class flocked to follow their example, so that the city alone gave <num value="2">two</num>, full regiments and helped to fill up others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The news from <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had given but a fresh impetus to these preparations and, before my return to <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, these regiments had passed through, on their way to the new battle ground on the <rs>Potomac</rs> frontier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>On the night of our arrival in the <rs type="place">Gulf City</rs>, that escape valve for all excitement, a dense crowd, collected in front of the <rs type="place">Battle House</rs> and <persName n="Forsyth,Colonel,John,,," id="n0014.0008.00055.00087" reg="default:Forsyth,John,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Forsyth</surname></persName> addressed them from the balcony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>He had just returned from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with the southern commissioners and gave, he said, a true narrative of the manner and results of their mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>At this lapse of time it is needless to detail even the substance of his speech; but it made a marked impression on the crowd, as the surging sea of upturned faces plainly told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/><persName n="Forsyth,,John,,," id="n0014.0008.00055.00088" reg="default:Forsyth,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Forsyth</surname></persName>, already acknowledged <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest of southern leaders, was a veritable Harry Hotspur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>His views brooked no delay or temporizing; and, as he spoke, in vein of fiery elegance, shouts and yells of defiant approval rose in full swell of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Once he named a noted Alabamian, whom he seemingly believed to have played a double part in these negotiations; and the excited auditory greeted his name with hisses and execrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>That they did their fellow-citizen injustice the most trying councils of the war proved; for he soon after came South and wrought, with all the grand power in him, during the whole enduring struggle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Staple was tired of politics, and hated a crowd; so he soon lounged off to the club, an institution gotten up with a delightful regard to the most comfortable arrangement and the most accomplished <hi rend="italics">chef</hi> in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>There <num value="1">one</num> met the most cordial hospitality, the neatest entertainment and the very best wines in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The cook was an artist, as our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supper declared; and play could be found, too, as needed; for young <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> was not slow, and money., in those days, was plenty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/><pb id="p.56" n="56"/> </p> 
<p>Altogether, the tone of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> society was more cosmopolitan than that of any city of the <rs>South</rs>, save, perhaps, New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>It may be that its commercial connections, reaching largely abroad, produced the effect; or that propinquity to and constant intercourse with its sister city induced freer mode of thought and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Located at the head of her beautiful bay, wi'th a wide sweep of blue water before her, the cleanly-built, unpaved streets gave <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> a fresh, cool aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>The houses were fine and their appointments in good, and sometimes luxurious, taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The society was a very pleasure-loving organization, enjoying the gifts of situation, of climate and of fortune to their full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/><hi rend="italics">On dit</hi>, it sometimes forgot the <rs>Spartan</rs> code; but the stranger was never made aware of that, for it ever sedulously remembered good taste. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Between the drives, dinners and other time-killers, <num value="1">one</num> week slipped around with great rapidity; and we could hardly realize it when the colonel looked over his newspaper at breakfast and said: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>She was a trimmer craft than our floating card-house of river travel, built for a little outside work in case of necessity, or the chances of a norther. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>We scudded merrily down the bay toward <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName>, the grim sentinel sitting dark and lonely at the harbor's mouth and showing a row of teeth that might be a warning.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>I was following Styles down from the upper deck, when we heard high voices from the end of the boat, and recognized <num value="1">one</num> exclaiming: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Round the open bar we found an excited crowd, in the center of which was our worldly-minded middie of river-boat memory and <quote><persName n="Chicken,,Spring,,," id="n0014.0008.00056.00091" reg="default:Chicken,Spring,,,"><foreName>Spring</foreName> <surname>Chicken</surname></persName>,</quote> his colleague; both talking very loud, and the latter exhibiting a bowie-knife half as long as himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>By considerable talk and more elbowing, we made our way to the boys; and, with the aid of a friendly stoker, got them both safely in my stateroom. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>At a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glimpse, New Orleans of those days was anything but a picturesque city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Built upon marshy flats, below the level of the river and protected from inundation by the <name>Levee</name>, her antique and weathered houses seemed to cower and cluster together as though in fear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>But for a long time, <quote>The <rs type="place">Crescent city</rs></quote> had been at the head of commercial importance-and the desideratum of direct trade had been more nearly filled by her enterprising merchants than all others in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The very great majority of the wealthy population was either <placeName reg="Creola, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2079141">Creole</placeName>, or <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0014.0009.00059.00106" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>; and their connection with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> houses may account in some measure for that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>The coasting trade at the war was heavy all along the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> shore; the trade with the islands a source of large revenue, and there were lines and frequent private enterprises across the ocean. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>For many reasons, it was then believed New Orleans could never become a great port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Foremost, the conformation of the <rs>Delta</rs>, at the mouth of the river, prevented vessels drawing over <num value="15">fifteen</num> feetat most favorable tides &mdash; from crossing either of the <num value="3">three</num> bars; and the most practical and scientific engineers, both of civil life and the army, had long tried in vain to remedy the defect for longer than a few weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Numerous causes have been assigned for the rapid reformation of these bars; the chemical action of the salt upon the vegetable matter in the river water; the rapid deposit of alluvium as the current slackens; and a churning effect produced by the meeting of the channel with the waves of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>They cpuld not be successfully removed, however, and were a great drawback to the trade of the city; which its location at the mouth of the great water avenue of the whole <rs>West</rs>, makes more advantageous than any other point in the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>The river business in cotton, sugar and syrup was, at this time, <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> immense; and the agents of the planters-factor is the generic term --made large fortunes in buying and selling at a merely nominal rate of percentage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>The southern planter of <hi rend="italics">ante-bellum</hi> days was a man of ease and luxury, careless of business and free to excess with money; and relations between him and his agent were entirely unique. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>He had the same factor for years, drawing when he pleased for any amount, keeping open books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>When his crop came in, it was shipped to the factor, the money retained-subject to draft-or invested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>But it was by no means rare, when reckoning day came, for the advance drafts to have left the planter in debt his whole crop to the factor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>In that case, it used to cost him a trip to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, or a summer at <placeName reg="Schuylerville, Saratoga, New York" key="tgn,7014490">Saratoga</placeName> only; and he stayed on his plantation and did not cry over the spilt milk, however loudly his ladies may have wailed for the missing <hi rend="italics">creme-de-la-creme</hi> of <placeName reg="Virginia Springs, Beaverhead, Montana" key="tgn,2745743">Virginia springs</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The morning after arrival we at last saw <quote>the house;</quote> which, far from being an imposing edifice, was a dingy, small office, just off the <name>Levee</name>, with the dingier sign of <quote>Long, Staple &amp; Middling</quote> over the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>There were a few stalwart negroes basking in the sun about the entrance, sleeping comfortably in the white glare, or showing glancing ivories, in broad grins-each <num value="1">one</num> keeping his shining cotton hook in full view, like a badge of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Within was a perfect steam of business, and Staple <hi rend="italics">pere</hi> was studying a huge ledger through a pair of heavy gold spectacles-popping orders like firecrackers, at half a dozen attentive clerks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Long, the senior partner, was in Virginia-and Middling, the junior, was hardly more than an expert foreman of the establishment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Full, baggy, scarlet trowsers, confined round the waist by the broad, blue band or sash, bearing the bowie-knife and meeting, at mid-leg, the white gaiter; blue shirt cut very low and exhibiting the brawny, sunburnt throat; jacket heavily braided and embroidered, flying loosely off the shoulders, and the jaunty <hi rend="italics">fez</hi>, surmounting the whole, made a bright <hi rend="italics">ensemble</hi> that contrasted prettily with the gray and silver of the <name>South Carolinians</name>, or the rusty brown of the <name>Georgians</name>, who came in crowds to see them off. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>Very soon after their state went out of the <rs>Union</rs>, and it became settled that the policy of the central Government was to take possession of the border states by force, the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> decided that the battle was to be fought on her soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Her nearness to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the facility of land communication, and the availabilty of her waterways for transportation purposes, all pointed to this; and the southern Government also became aware that the <rs>Potomac</rs> boundary of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was the <num value="1">one</num> to be most jealously guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>Under these circumstances, when the tender of the use of the state capital at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was made to the <rs>Montgomery Government</rs>, the advantages of the move were at once apparent, and the proffer was promptly accepted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>When we returned to <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, preparations for removal were in such state of progress that the change would be made in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>Archives and public property not in daily use had already been sent on, and some of the force of the executive departments were already in the new capital, preparing for the reception of the remainder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>Troops in large bodies had already been forwarded to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> from all parts of the <rs>South</rs>, and all indications were that, before the summer was over, an active campaign on the soil of the Old Dominion would be in progress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>About this time, a telegram from <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0014.0011.00075.00141" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> appeared in the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, which created as much comment at the <rs>South</rs> as at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>With the <num value="2">two</num> sections in a state of open hostility, and with armies already in the field and manoeuvering for position, it was somewhat singular that the avowed correspondent of a northern journal should be allowed in the southern Capital; but, when his dispatches bore on their face some signs of authoritative sanction, it became stranger still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/><pb id="p.76" n="76"/> </p> 
<p>The correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> was a well-known lobby member of years standing, but avowedly a southern man. His intercourse with the leaders of the government was, at least, friendly, and his predictions and assertions in the columns of that newspaper were generally borne out in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>The state of the country was an anomalous <num value="1">one</num>, but this method of waging war was still more so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>The history of the dispatch in question was simply this: There had been much jubilation in <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> over the news from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>Serenades had been made, speeches delivered, and the invariable whisky had not been neglected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>Late at night, I was shown a copy of this dispatch, as <num value="1">one</num> about to be sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>On my doubting it, I was credibly informed that it had been shown to at least <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role" reg="Cabinet-Officer">cabinet officer</rs>, and received his approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>And it went! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>When it was finally settled that the <rs>Capital</rs> was to be moved to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the city of <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> began to wail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>It had all along been utterly and most emphatically opposed to the location of the government there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>It would ruin the trade, the morals and the reputation of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>Dowagers had avowed their belief that the continuance of the <rs>Congress</rs> there for <num value="1">one</num> year would render the city as perfect a Sodom as Washington-would demoralize the society beyond purification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>Men of business had grumbled at being disturbed from their fixed routine of many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>But now that the incubus was to be removed, there was a strong pressure to prevent &mdash; and bitter denunciations of &mdash; the outrage! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>Leaders came out in the papers, advising against the practicability; scathing articles about perfidy sometimes appeared; and it was, on all hands, prophesied that the government would lose caste and dignity, and become a traveling caravan if the change were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>Where will the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> find it when they send their ministers to recognize the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>?-was the peroration of these eloquent advocates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>Now, as there was no contract made or implied, in locating the provisional government at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, that it was to be the permanent Capital; or that the exigencies of the war might not necessitate a change to some point more available, this was at least unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>True, the people had made sacrifices, and had inconvenienced <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>But what they had done was for the country, and not for the <rs>Government</rs>; and had, besides, been done equally elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>And the location, even temporarily, of the <rs>Government</rs> there had aided the town greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>It had become the converging point of railroad and contract business for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and the depots and storehouses located there would be of course continued, throwing a vast amount of business activity and money into it. So, though the people might be somewhat morbid on the subject, their arguments against the change were, on the whole, if natural, not founded on fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>But, perfectly regardless of the thunders of the press and the growlings of the people, the preparations for removal and the change of base to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> went steadily on, By the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, everything had been completed &mdash; the <rs>President</rs> and Cabinet left <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> &mdash; the fact, that had for some time been a real <num value="1">one</num>, was formally consummated; and <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0014.0011.00077.00144" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> became again the <rs>Capital</rs> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>I had nothing to keep me in town longer, so I started for a leisurely trip to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>But man proposes; and in this instance, the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName> disposed that travel was to be anything but practicable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>Trains, crowded with troops from all directions, met at the junctions, and there had to lay over for hours, or days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Burden trains, with supplies for the army, munitions of war, or government property from <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, blocked the road in all directions; and trains running <quote>not on time</quote> had to proceed much more carefully than ordinarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>In fact, there was not the amount of transportation at the disposal of the roads that the greatly enhanced demands required; and at every station nearer <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the pressure of passengers and freight became greater. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>Through <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 24" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> I bore the troubles of the transit like a philosopher; but under <num value="3">three</num> detentions between <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> and <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, of from <num value="9">nine</num> to <measure n="13hours" type="date">thirteen hours</measure>, patience and endurance both gave way. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>But the most remarked dress that flashed among these varied uniforms was the blue-and-orange of the <orgName type="mil" key="MDZouaveVolunteer">Maryland Zouaves</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>When it became apparent that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> could take no active part in the struggle, many members of this corps promptly left the luxuries of their homes, their early associations, and even the very means of livelihood, to go south and battle for the principles they held.

<p>Much has been said and much written of the <name>Marylanders</name> in the <rs>South</rs>; of their demoralized condition, their speculative tendencies, and their wild dissipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>Not a few of them came for plundersome left their country for their country's good:--but in the veins of such only a muddy current ran!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Where the <rs>Maryland</rs> gentleman was found on the stranger soil, it was musket in hand, battling for it; and so well was his <hi rend="italics">devoir</hi> done, that he rapidly changed the bayonet for the sword; and more than <num value="1">one</num> general, whose name will live in the <rs>South</rs>, came from their number. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>Almost all the soldiery wore the broad, soft <hi rend="italics">slouch</hi>, in place of the more military, but less comfortable, <hi rend="italics">kepi</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>Arms, too, were as varied as the uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>The greatest variety was in the cavalry &mdash; if such it could be called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>Men accustomed from infancy to the saddle and the rifle had seized whatever weapon they were possessed of; and more at home on horseback than on foot, they were, no doubt, ugly enemies in a bush fight, or an ambuscade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>Many whole companies had no sabers but those their officers carried, and the very individuality and self-reliance of the men acted as an invincible opponent to drill and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>Mounted on horses of all sizes and colors; equipped with all varieties of trappings; and carrying slung at their backs every known game-killer &mdash; from rifle to duck gun &mdash; they would have been a strange picture to the <rs>European</rs> officer to which their splendid horsemanship and lithe, agile figures could have added no varnish to make him believe them cavalry. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>But every man you met, mounted or footman, carried in his belt the broad, straight, double-edged bowie-knife, useful alike for warlike, or culinary purposes; and few, indeed, did not balance it with the revolver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>In some of the crack corps this was strictly prohibited ; for the difficulty has ever been in armies to teach the men to use efficiently the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> weapon belonging to them; and that there is no safety in a multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>I constantly had brought to mind the anecdote of the <rs>Crimean Zouaves</rs>, about to charge a redan, who answered their officer's query as to the number of cartridges they had by tapping their saber bayonets. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>The arriving regiments were inspected, mustered into the <rs>Confederate</rs> service and drilled by competent officers; vacancies were filled; and such wanting equipments, as could be supplied, bestowed upon them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>There had been much doubt among the southern leaders as to the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of the western armies, on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>Old and tried officers felt secure, <foreign lang="la">ceteris paribus</foreign>, of success against the northern troops of the coast, or Middle States; but the hardy hunters from the <name>West</name> and <name>North</name>-west were men of a very different stamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>The resources of the whole country had been strained to send into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> such an army in numbers and equipment as the preparation for invasion of her borders seemed to warrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>This had left the <name>South</name> and <name>South</name>west rather more thinly garrisoned than all deemed prudent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>The <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> grounds for security in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> were that the mass of the southern troops were thoroughly accustomed to the use of arms and perfectly at home on horseback; and no doubts were felt that the men of the <rs>Northeastern States</rs>, there opposed to them, were far below them in both requirements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>The superior excellence of the latter in arms, equipment, and perhaps discipline, was more than compensated to the former by their greater familiarity with the arms they carried and their superiority of physique and endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>Any advantage of numbers, it was argued, was made up by the fact of the invading army being forced to fight on the ground chosen by the invaded; and in the excellence of her tacticians, rather more than in any expected equality of numbers, the main reliance of the southern government was placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>Hence it was full of confidence as to the result in the <rs>East</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>In the <rs>West</rs>, it was far different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>There the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were recruited from the hardy trappers and frontiersmen of the border; from the sturdy yeomen of the inland farms; and, in many instances, whole districts had separated, and men from adjoining farms had gone to join in a deadly fight, in opposing ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>Though the partisan spirit with these was stronger than with other southern troops &mdash; for they added the bitterness of personal hate to the sectional feeling-yet thinking people felt that the men themselves were more equally matched in courage, endurance and the knowledge of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>It is an old axiom in war, that when the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of armies is equal, victory is apt to rest with numbers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>Thus, the fight at <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName> was viewed by the <rs>Government</rs> as a test question of deep meaning; and <persName n="Price,,Sterling,,," id="n0014.0015.00117.00262" reg="default:Price,Sterling,,,"><foreName>Sterling</foreName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> began at once to rank as a rising man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>The bitterness that the mass <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> of the people of the South-especially in Virginia-felt against that officer did not affect their exalted opinion of his vast grasp of mind and great military science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>Each splashed and weary-looking man was stopped and surrounded by crowds, who poured varied and anxious questioning upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>Rare stores of old wines were freely given; baskets of cordials and rolls of lint were brought; and often that night, as the women leaned over the baskets they so carefully packed, bitter tears rolled from their pale cheeks and fell noiselessly on bandage and lint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>Then he spoke words of consolation to the stricken city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>Many of her noblest were spared; the wounded had reaped a glory far beyond the scars they bore; the dead were honored far beyond the living, and future generations should twine the laurel for their crown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>The great crowd listened with breathless interest to his lightest word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>Old men, resting on their staves, erected themselves; reckless boys were quiet and still; and the pale faces of the women, furrowed with tears, looked up at him till the color came back to their cheeks and their eyes dried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>Of a truth, he was still their idol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>As yet they hung upon his lightest word, and believed that what he did was best. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Then the crowd dispersed, many mournfully wending their way to the <rs>Capitol</rs> where the dead officers lay in state, wrapped in the flag of the new victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>An hour after, the rain descending in torrents, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ambulance train arrived. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> came forth the slightly wounded, with bandaged heads, arms in slings, or with painful limp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>Then came ugly, narrow boxes of rough plank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>These were tenderly handled, and the soldiers who bore them upon their shoulders carried sad faces, too; for happily as yet the death of friends in the <rs>South</rs> was not made, by familiarity, a thing of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>And lastlylifted so gently, and suffering so patiently-came the ghastly burdens of the stretchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>Strong men, maimed and torn, their muscular hands <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> straining the handles of the litter with the bitter effort to repress complaint, the horrid crimson ooze marking the rough cloths thrown over them; delicate, fair-browed boys, who had gone forth a few days back so full of life and hope, now gory and livid, with clenched teeth and matted hair, and eyeballs straining for the loved faces that must be there to wait them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>It was a strange crowd that stood there in the driving storm, lit up by the fitful flashes of the moving lanterns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>The whole city was there &mdash; the rich merchant &mdash; the rough laborer --the heavy features of the sturdy serving-woman &mdash; the dusky, but loving face of the negro &mdash; the delicate profile of the petted belle-all strained forward in the same intent gaze, as car after car was emptied of its ghastly freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>There, under the pitiless storm, they stood silent and still, careless of its fury &mdash; not a sound breaking the perfect hush, in which the measured tramp of the carriers, or the half-repressed groan of the wounded, sounded painfully distinct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>Now and then, as a limping soldier was recognized, would come a rush and a cry of joy-strong arms were given to support himten-der hands were laid upon his hair-and warm lips were pressed to his blanched cheek, drenched with the storm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>Here some wife, or sister, dropped bitter tears on the unconscious face of the household darling, as she walked by the stretcher where he writhed in fevered agony.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>There was a vague, unconscious feeling of joy in those who had found their darlings-even shattered and maimed; an unbearable and leaden weight of agonizing suspense and dread hung over those who could hear nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>Many wandered restlessly about the <rs>Capitol</rs>, ever and anon questioning the guard around the dead generals; but the sturdy men of the <name>Legion</name> could only give kindly and vague answers that but heightened the feverish anxiety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>Day after day the ambulance trains came in bearing their sad burdens, and the same scene was ever enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>Strangers, miles from home, met the same care as the brothers and husbands of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; and the meanest private was as much a hero as the tinseled officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/><pb id="p.127" n="127"/> </p> 
<p>It is strange how soon even the gentlest natures gain a familiarity with suffering and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>The awfulness and solemnity of the unaccustomed sight loses rapidly by daily contact with it; even though the sentiments of sympathy and pity may not grow callous as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>But, as yet, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was new to such scenes; and a shudder went through the whole social fabric at the shattering and tearing of the fair forms so well known and so dear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Gradually-very gradually &mdash; the echoes of the fight rolled into distance; the wildest wailing settled to the steady sob of suffering, and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> went her way, with only here and there a wreck of manhood, or pale-faced woman in deepest mourning, to recall the fever of that fearful night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>Though the after effect of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> proved undoubtedly bad, the immediate fruits of the victory were of incalculable value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>Panicstruck, the <rs>Federals</rs> had thrown away everything that could impede their flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>Besides <num value="54">fifty-four</num> pieces of artillery of all kinds, horses and mules in large numbers, ammunition, medical stores and miles of wagon and ambulance trains, near <num value="6000">six thousand</num> stand of small arms, of the newest pattern and in best condition, fell into the hands of the half-armed rebels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>These last were the real prize of the victors, putting a dozen new regiments waiting only for arms, at once on an effective war-footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>Blankets, tents and clothing were captured in bulk; nor were they to be despised by soldiers who had, left home with knapsacks as empty as those of <persName n="Falstaff,,,,," id="n0014.0016.00127.00303" reg="mostcommon:Falstaff,nomatch:0"><surname>Falstaff</surname></persName>'s heroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>But the moral effect of the victory was to elate the tone of the army far above any previous act of the war. Already prepared not to undervalue their own prowess, its ease and completeness left a universal sense of their invincibility, till the feeling became common in the ranks-and spread thence to the people &mdash; that <num value="1">one</num> southern man was worth a dozen <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>; and that if they did not come in numbers greater than <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, the result of any conflict was assured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>Everything was going smoothly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rough outlines had been laid in, with bold effectiveness, a rosy cloud floated over the grim distance of the war; and in the foreground-only brilliant and victorious action. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>The Federal loss was harder to estimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Many of their wounded had been borne away by the rush of the retreat; the <rs>Government</rs>, naturally anxious to calm the public mind of the <rs>North</rs>, made incomplete returns ;. while large numbers of uncounted dead had been buried on the field and along the line of retreat, both by the victorious army and country people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>From the best data obtainable, their loss could not have been much short, if at all short, of <num value="5000">five thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>The army was satisfied, the country was satisfied, and, unfortunately, the <rs>Government</rs> was satisfied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Among the people there was a universal belief in an immediate advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>The army that had been the main bulwark of the <rs>National Capital</rs> was rushing &mdash; a panic-stricken herd-into and beyond it; the fortifications were perfectly uncovered and their small garrisons utterly demoralized by the woe-begone and terrified fugitives constantly streaming by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The triumphant legions of the <rs>South</rs> were almost near enough for their battle-cry to be heard in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>; and the southern people could not believe that the bright victory that had perched upon their banners would be allowed to fold her wings before another and bloodier flight, that would leave the <rs>North</rs> prostrate at her feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>Day after day they waited and &mdash; the wish being father to the thought-day after day the sun rose on fresh stories of an advance---a bloody fight &mdash; a splendid victory-or the capture of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>But the sun always set on an authoritative contradiction of them; and at last the excitement was forced to settle down on the news that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0016.00128.00304" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> had extended his pickets as far as <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n0014.0016.00128.00305" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Munson,,,,," id="n0014.0016.00128.00306" reg="mostcommon:Munson,nomatch:0"><surname>Munson</surname></persName>'s hills, and the army had gone into camp on the field it had so bloodily won the week before. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>Considering the surroundings, it seems inevitable that the lull after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great victory should have been followed by reaction, all over the <rs>South</rs>; and that reasons &mdash; as ridiculous as they were numerousshould have been assigned for inaction that appeared so unwarranted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>Discontent-at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> whispered, and coming as the wind comethgradually took tongue; and discussion of the situation grew loud and varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/><num value="1">One</num> side declared that the orders for a general advance had been already given, when the <rs>President</rs> countermanded them upon the field, and sent orders by <persName n="Bonham,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00129.00311" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bonham</surname></persName> to withdraw the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Another version of this reason was that there had been a council of the generals and <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0017.00129.00312" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Varina,Howell,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, at which it was agreed that the <rs>North</rs> must now be convinced of the utter futility of persisting in invasion; and that in the reaction her conservative men would make themselves heard; whereas the occupation of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> would inflame the <rs>North</rs> and cause the people to rise as <num value="1">one</num> man for the defense of their capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>An even wilder theory found believers; that the war in the <rs>South</rs> was simply <num value="1">one</num> of defense, and crossing the <rs>Potomac</rs> would be <hi rend="italics">invasion</hi>, the effect of which would retard recognition from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>Another again declared that there was a jealousy between <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00129.00313" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00129.00314" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,Pierre,G.,T.,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and between each of them and the <rs>President</rs>, that prevented concert of action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The people of the <rs>South</rs> were eminently democratic and had their own views &mdash; which they expressed with energy and vim &mdash; on all subjects during the war; so these theories, to account for the paralysis after <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, were each in turn discussed, and each found warm defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>But gradually it came to be generally conceded that none of them could be the true <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> took no command on his visit to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, for he reached the field only after the battle had been won and the flight commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Any suggestions that: occurred to him were naturally made to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00129.00315" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>There is good authority for stating that he did not make any criticism on <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> material point, stating to both generals that the whole plan, conduct and result of the battle met his fullest approval; and on reflection the whole people felt that their chief was too much a soldier to have committed the gross breach of discipline indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>The story of the council came to be regarded as a silly fabrication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>The fear of inflaming the <rs>North</rs>, coming on the heels of a complete and bloody victory, was about as funny as for a pugilist whose antagonist's head was <quote>in chancery</quote> to cease striking lest he should anger him; and events immediately following <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> showed there could be little jealousy or pique between the generals, or between them and the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00130.00316" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, with the magnanimity of the true knight his whole career has shown him to be, declared that the credit of the plan and choice of the field of battle was due to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00130.00317" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,Pierre,G.,T.,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>; and <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0017.00130.00318" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Varina,Howell,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>' proclamation on the success was couched in language that breathed only the most honest commendation of both generals and of their strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>The fear of invasion prejudicing opinion abroad was as little believed as the other stories, for-outside of a small clique &mdash; there grew up at this time all over the <rs>South</rs> such a perfect confidence in its strength and its perfect ability to work its own oracle, that very little care was felt for the action of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>In fact, the people were just now quite willing to wait for recognition of their independence by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> powers, until it was already achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>So, gradually the public mind settled down to the true reasons that mainly prevented the <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> following up of the victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>A battle under all circumstances is a great confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>With raw troops, who had never before been under fire, and who had been all day fiercely contending, until broken and disordered, the confusion must necessarily have been universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>As they broke, or fell back, brigade overlapped brigade, company mixed with company, and officers lost their regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>The face of the country, covered with thick underbrush, added to this result; so that when the enemy broke and the rout commenced, it was hard to tell whether pursuers or pursued were the most disorganized mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>The army of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was almost entirely undisciplined, and had never before felt the intoxication of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>On that terrible day it had fought with tenacity and pluck that belonged to the race; but it had largely been on the principle prevalent at weddings in the <quote>ould country</quote> --when you see a head, hit it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>The few officers who desired <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> a disciplined resistance soon saw the futility of obtaining it, and felt that as the men, individually, were fighting bravely and stubbornly, it were better only to hold them to that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>When the pursuit came, the men were utterly worn and exhausted; but, burning with the glow of battle, they followed the flying masses fast and far --each <num value="1">one</num> led by his own instincts and rarely <num value="20">twenty</num> of a company together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>A <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">major-general</rs>, who left his leg on a later field, carried his company into this fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>During the pursuit he led it through a by-path to intercept a battery spurring down the road at full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>They overtook it, mastered the gunners and turned the horses out of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>In the deepening twilight, he turned to thank the company, and found it composed of <num value="3">three</num> of his own men, <num value="2">two</num> <quote>Tiger rifles,</quote> a Washington artilleryman, <num value="3">three</num> dismounted cavalry of the <quote>Legion,</quote> a doctor, a quartermaster's clerk, and <persName n="Chaplain,Reverend,,,," id="n0014.0017.00131.00319" reg="mostcommon:Chaplain,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <surname>Chaplain</surname></persName> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>This was but a specimen of the style of the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>There was but little cavalry-<num value="1">one</num> regiment under <persName n="Stuart,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0014.0017.00131.00320" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,:2"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and a few single companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>No <num value="1">one</num> brigade could be collected in anything like order; night was deepening and the enemy's flight was approaching what was reasonably supposed to be his reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>Under these circumstances it was apparent that prudence, if not necessity, dictated calling in the pursuit by the disordered troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/><persName n="Bonham,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00131.00321" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bonham</surname></persName>--the ranking officer in front-saw this plainly; and on his own authority gave the order that appeared most proper to him. I never heard that, <hi rend="italics">at this time</hi>, it was objected to by his superior officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>Moreover, it was not only the demoralization caused by the pursuit that was sufficient reason for not following up <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>The army, ordinarily, was not in a condition to advance into an enemy's country, away from its regular communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>In the first place, there was no transportation, and the arms were bad. It was a work of time to utilize the spoils; to distribute arms where most needed; to put the captured batteries in condition for use; and to replace with the splendid ambulances and army wagons, that had been prepared for the holiday march to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the hastily and clumsily-constructed ones already in use; and to so give out the captured horses as best to utilize them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>This latter was of the utmost moment before an advance could be attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>The Confederates were shorter of <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> transportation-even of defective character-than of anything else; and for days after the fight the flood-gates of heaven seemed to stand open, to deluge the country around <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> until it became a perfect lake of mud. Roads already bad were washed into gullies; holes, generally knee-deep became impassable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>It is perfectly easy, therefore, to understand why, for a week after the battle, delay was necessary; but as week after week passed, and there was still no forward movement, it ceased to be strange that the people should murmur, and ask why it was the army was satisfied with laurels easily won when fresh ones were within its grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>All felt that veteran officers handling raw troops had to be more careful in their management, and to count more closely before putting them into the new and dangerous position of an invading army, than would meet with the concurrence of a populace naturally ardent and doubly heated by triumph. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>But it is equally true that for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after the battle, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> lay perfectly at the mercy of the <rs>South</rs>; and by that time the army of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was in better condition than could be expected later; and it was anxious to move forward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>But the auspicious moment was not seized; time was given for the broken fragments of the <rs>Union</rs> army to be patched again into something like organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>Fresh forts and earthworks were hastily thrown up; a perfect chain of defenses formed around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,. and strongly garrisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>The pickets of the opposing armies were near enough to exchange constant shots, and even occasional <quote>chaff.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/></p> 
<p>Still there was no movement; the summer wore away in utter inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>The camp at <placeName reg="Orange Courthouse">Orange Courthouse</placeName> began to be looked upon as a stationary affair; while the usual difficulties of camp lifeaggra-vated by the newness of the troops and the natural indisposition of the southron to receive discipline-began to show themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>The army at this time was principally composed of the better educated and better conditioned class, who were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to volunteer; and as I have already said, many of the privates were men of high position, culture and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Thus composed, it was equal to great deeds of gallantry and dash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/><hi rend="italics">Elan</hi> was its characteristic-but it was hard to reduce to the stratified regularity of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/><persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n0014.0017.00132.00322" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName> has laid down as an axiom that no man is a good soldier until he has become a perfect machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>He must neither reason nor think-only obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Critics, <pb id="p.133" n="133"/> perhaps equally competent, in reviewing the <name>Crimean</name> war, differ from this and declare the main advantage of the <rs>French</rs> troops over the <rs>Russian</rs> was a certain individuality &mdash; a pride in themselves and their army that had been entirely drilled out of their stolid adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>Be this as it may, the <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> of the <name>Frenchman</name> was in his corps only as such; and he would no more have discussed the wisdom, or prudence of any order-even in his own mind-than he would have thought of disobeying it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>The steady-going professional men who sprung to arms throughout the <rs>South</rs> could face a deadly fire, without blenching, for hours; but they could not help reasoning, with nothing to do for <measure n="20hours" type="date">twenty hours</measure> out of every <num value="24">twenty-four</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>The gay young graduates of the promenade and ball-room could march steadily, even gaily, into the fiery belching of a battery, but they could not learn the practice of unreasoning blindness; and the staunch, hard-fisted countryman felt there was no use in it-the thing was over if the fighting was done-and this was a waste of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/><hi rend="italics">Nostalgia</hi>-that scourge of camps &mdash; began to creep among the latter class; discontent grew apace among the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>Still the camp was the great object of interest for miles around; there were reviews, parades and division dinners; ladies visited and inspected it, and some even lived within its lines; but the tone of the army went down gradually, but steadily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>During the summer more than <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName n="companies"><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0014.0017.00133.00323" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,Pierre,G.,T.,:1"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s companies</orgName>-though of the best material and with a brilliant record-had to be mustered out as <quote>useless and insubordinate.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>Excellence in drill and attention to duty both decreased; and it was felt by competent judges that rust was gradually eating away the fabric of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>This was certainly the fault to a great extent of the officers, though it may, in part, have been due to the men themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>In the beginning these had tried honestly to choose those among them best fitted for command; but like all volunteers, they fell into the grave error of choosing the most popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>Almost all candidates for office were equally eligible and equally untried; so personal considerations naturally came into play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>Once elected, they did their duty faithfully, in the field; but were either too weak, or too inexperienced, to keep the strict rules of discipline applied during the trying inactivity of camp; and they were too conscious of the social and mental equality of their men to enforce the distinction between officer and <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> private, without which the command loses half its weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>In some instances, too, the desire for popularity and for future advancement at the hands of friends and neighbors introduced a spirit of demagogism hurtful in the extreme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>For these combined reasons the army of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, which a few weeks before had gone so gaily <quote>into the jaws of death,</quote> began rapidly to mildew through warp and woof; and the whole texture seemed on the point of giving way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>Thoughtful men &mdash; who had waited calmy and coolly when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> burst of impatience had gone up-began now to ask why and how long this lethargy was to continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>They saw its bad effects, but believed that at the next blast of the bugle every man would shake off the incubus and rise in his might a patriot soldier; they saw the steady stream of men from <name>North</name> and <name>West</name> pouring into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to be at once bound and held with iron bands of discipline &mdash; the vast preparation in men, equipments, supplies and science that the <rs>North</rs> was using the precious days granted her to get in readiness for the next shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>But they felt confident that the southern army &mdash; if not allowed to rust too long-would again vindicate the name it had won at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>These thinkers saw that some branches of the <rs>Government</rs> still kept up its preparations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>Throughout the length of the land foundries were going up, and every improvement that science or experience could suggest was making in the construction of arms and ammunition; water-power, everywhere off the line of attack, was utilized for powder-mills and rope-walks; every cloth factory in the country was subsidized; and machinery of great variety and power was being imported on Government account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>Over <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> constantly hung a dense cloud of coal smoke; and the incessant buzz of machinery from factories, foundries and lathes, told of increased rather than abated effort in that branch of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>Then, too, the most perfect confidence was felt in the great strategic ability of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00134.00324" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>--who had already found that high level in the opinion of his countrymen, from which neither the frowns of government, the combination of cliques, nor the tongues of slanderers could afterward remove him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>They believed, too, in the pluck and dash of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0014.0017.00134.00325" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,Pierre,G.,T.,:1"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>; and, combining this with the outside activity, evident in every direction, <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> felt there must be good and sufficient reason for the &mdash; to theminex-plicable quiet about the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>But perhaps the very worst feature was the effect of the victory upon the tone of the people at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>The very tongues that had wagged most impatiently at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> delay &mdash; that had set in motion the wild stories by which to account for it-had been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to become blatant that the <rs>North</rs> was conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>The minutest details of the fight were carried over the land, repeated at country courts and amplified at bar-room assemblages, until the common slang was everywhere heard that <num value="1">one</num> Southron was equal to a dozen <persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0014.0017.00135.00326" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,nomatch:0"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>Instead of using the time, so strangely given by the <rs>Government</rs>, in making earnest and steady strides toward increasing the army, improving its <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> and adding to its supplies, the masses of the country were upon a rampage of boastfulness, and the notes of an inflated triumph rang from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>In this regard the effect of the victory was most injurious; and had it not been for the crushing results &mdash; from a strategic point of view &mdash; that would have followed it, partial defeat might have proved a blessing in its place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>The <num value="1">one</num>, while it threw a gloom over the country, would have nerved the people to renewed exertion and made them look steadily and unwaveringly at the true dangers that threatened them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>The other gave them time to fold their hands and indulge in a complacency, ridiculous as it was enervating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>They ceased to realize the vast resources of the <rs>Union</rs> in men, money and supplies; and more than all, they underrated the dogged perseverance of <name>Yankee</name> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>It was as though a young boxer, in a deadly conflict with a giant, had dealt a staggering blow; and while the <rs>Titan</rs> braced his every muscle for a deadlier gripe, the weaker antagonist wasted his time lauding his strength and feeling his biceps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>Meantime, the keen, hard sense of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> wasted no time in utilizing the reaction on its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>The press and the public clamored for a victim, and <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00135.00327" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> was thrown into its maw unhesitatingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>The old hero was replaced by the new, and <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0014.0017.00135.00328" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>-whose untried and inexperienced talent could hardly have augured his becoming, as he did, the best general of the northern army &mdash; was elevated to his place to please the <quote>dear public.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/><pb id="p.136" n="136"/> </p> 
<p>The rabid crowds of men and men-women-whose prurient curiosity had driven them to follow the great on-to-Richmond, with hopes of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> view of the triumphant entry of the <rs>Grand</rs> Army-soon forgot their uncomfortable and terrified scramble to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>They easily changed their whine of terror to a song of triumph; and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Judiths, burning to grasp the hair of the <name>Holofernes</name> over the <rs>Potomac</rs>, pricked the flagging zeal of their male companions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>The peculiar error that they were fighting for the <rs>Union</rs> and the flag-so cruelly dissipated of late-threw <num value="1000">thousands</num> into the ranks; heavy bounties and hopes of plunder drew many more; and the still frequent interstices were filled with many an Irish-German amalgam, that was supposed to be peculiarly good food for powder. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>Active operations-along the whole northern frontier at leastwere certainly suspended until spring; and both armies had gone into winter quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Military men agree that a winter in camp is the most demoralizing influence to which any troops can be subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>To the new soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> it was a terrible ordeal --not so much from the actual privations they were called upon to endure as from other and more subtle difficulties, against the imperceptible approaches of which they could not guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>The Government had used every effort to make the men comfortable, and to supply them with all necessaries at its disposal; but still there were numerous articles it could not command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>The good caterers at home spared no pains, no exercise of ingenuity, and no pinching from fireside supplies, to make the loved ones in camp comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>The country had not begun to feel the effects of actual want in any quarter; but increased demand had lessened supplies on hand and somewhat enhanced prices; so the men were comfortably clothed, fed with plain, but plentiful and wholesome food, and supplied with all the absolute necessaries of camp life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>In addition to these, boxes of all sizes, shapes and contents came into the camps in a continuous stream; and the <num value="1000">thousand</num> nameless trifles-so precious because bearing the impress of home &mdash; were received daily in every mess from the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> to the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>Still, as the winter wore on, news from the armies became gloomier and gloomier, and each successive bulletin bore more dispiriting accounts of discontent and privation, sickness and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>Men who had gone into their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fight freely and gaily; who had heard the whistling of bullets as if it had been accustomed music, gave way utterly before the unseen foes of <quote>winter quarters.</quote>

<p>Here and there, a disciplinarian of the better sort &mdash; who combined philosophy with strictness-kept his men in rather better condition by constant watching, frequent and regular drills, rapid marches for exercise, and occasional change of camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>But this was the exception, and the general tone was miserable and gloomy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>This could in part be accounted for by the inexperience of the men, and of their immediate commanders &mdash; the company officersin whose hands their health and spirits were in no small degree reposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>They could not be brought to the use of those little appliances of comfort that camp life, even in the most unfavorable circumstances, can afford-strict attention to the utmost cleanliness in their persons and huts; care in the preparation of their food, and in its cookery; and careful adherence to the simple hygienic rules laid down in constant circulars from the medical and other departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Where men live and sleep in semi-frozen mud, and breathe an atmosphere of mist and brush smoke-and every <num value="1">one</num> knows the wonderfully penetrating power of camp-fire smoke &mdash; it is not to be expected that their comfort is enviably great; especially where they have left comfortable homes, and changed their well-prepared, if simple, food for the hard and innutritious army ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>But such creatures of habit are we that, after a little, we manage by proper care to make even that endurable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>Soldiers are like children, and require careful watching and constant reminding that these small matters &mdash; which certainly make up the sum of camp life &mdash; should be carefully attended to for their own good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>Rigid discipline in their enforcement is necessary in the beginning to get novices properly started in the grooves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>Once set going, they soon become matters of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/><hi rend="italics">Nostalgia-that</hi> scourge of camps-appeared in stubborn and alarming form; and no exertion of surgeon, or general, served to check or decrease it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/></p> 
<p>The general morality of the camps was good, but praying is a sorry substitute for dry homes and good food; and, though chaplains were earnest and zealous, the men gradually found cards more exciting than exhortations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>They turned from the <quote>wine of life</quote> to the canteen of <quote>new dip</quote> with a spiteful thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>There were attempts by the higher officers &mdash; which proved abortive &mdash; to discountenance gambling; and the most stringent efforts of provost-marshals to prevent the introduction of liquor to camp reduced the quantity somewhat, but brought down the quality to the grade of a not very slow poison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>Being much in the numerous camps that winter, I was struck with the universal slouch and depression in ranks where the custom had been quick energy and cheerful faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>Through the whole army was that enervating moldiness, lightened only by an occasional gleam from those <quote>crack companies</quote> so much doubted in the beginning of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>It had been thought that the gay young men of cities, used to the sedentary life of profession, or counting-room-and perhaps to the irregularities of the midnight dinner and next-morning ball-that these men, steady and unflinching as they might be under fire-and willing as they seemed to undertake <quote>what man dare</quote> in danger or privation, would certainly break down under the fatigues of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaign. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>They had, on the contrary, in every instance that came under my ken, gone through that campaign most honorably; had borne the marches, the most trying weather and the greatest straits of hunger, <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> with an elasticity of mind and muscle that had long since astounded and silenced their most active scoffers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>Now, in the bitter depths of winter, they went through the dull routine of camp, cheerful and buoyant, at all times ready for their duty, and never grumbling at the wearing strain they felt to be necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>When I say that in every Confederate camp <hi rend="italics">the best</hi> soldiers of that winter were <quote>crack companies</quote> of the gay youths of the cities, I only echo the verdict of old and tried officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>Where all did their duty nobly, comparison were invidious; but the names of <quote><orgName type="company" n="Company F">Company F</orgName>,</quote> the <rs>Mobile Cadets</rs>, the <orgName n="Richmond Blues" type="military">Richmond Blues</orgName>, and <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, stand on the record of those dark days as proof of the statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>A strange fact of these companies was frequently stated by surgeons of perfect reliability: their sick reports were much smaller than those of the hardiest mountain organizations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>This they attributed to <num value="2">two</num> causes: greater attention to personal cleanliness and to all hygienic precautions; and the exercise of better trained minds and wills keeping them free from the deadly <quote>blue devils.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>Numbers of them, of course, broke down at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Many a poor fellow who would have achieved a brilliant future perished mid the mud of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, or slept under the snowy slopes of the western mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1998"/>There was a stir and bustle new to quiet <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1999"/>Congress had brought crowds of attaches and hangers-on; and every department had its scores of dependents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>This brought the citizens and strangers more together, and naturally the result was a long season of more regular parties and unprecedented gaiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>Many still frowned at this, and, as usual, made unhappy <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> the scapegoat-averring that her pernicious example of heartlessness and frivolity had worked the evil. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/>Among the amateurs of the city were some who would have taken high rank in any musical circle, and these gave a series of concerts for the benefit of distressed families of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>I could not get accustomed to the undisputed supremacy of the unmarried element that almost entirely composed it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>Don't you wonder how we ever dare to declare ourselves old enough?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/></p> 
<p>I did wonder; for it had always been a hobby of mine that a certain amount of the married leaven was necessary in every society to give it tone and stamina.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>Though the <rs>French</rs> principle of excluding young ladies from all social intercourse, and giving the patent of society to <rs type="role2">Madame</rs>, may be productive of more harm than good, the converse seems equally objectionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>I can recollect no society in which some of the most pleasant memories do not center around the intercourse with its married portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is no exception to the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>In the <rs>South</rs>, women marry younger than in the colder states; and it often happens that the very brightest and most attractive points of character do not mature until an age when they have gotten their establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>The education of the <rs>Virginia</rs> girl is so very different in all essential points from that of the northerner of the same station, that she is far behind her in self-reliance and <hi rend="italics">aplomb</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>The southerner, more lanquid and emotional, but less self-dependent-even if equally <quote>up in</quote> showier accomplishments &mdash; is not formed to shine most at an early stage of her social career.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>Hence, I was much puzzled to account for the patent fact that the better matured of its flowers should be so entirely suppressed, in the <rs>Richmond</rs> bouquet, by the half-opened buds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>These latter, doubtless, gave a charming promise of bloom and fragrance when they came to their full; but too early they left an effect of immaturity and crudity upon the sense of the unaccustomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>Yet <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> had written over the portals of its society: Who enters here no spouse must leave behind!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2066"/>The male element at parties ranged from <hi rend="italics">the passe</hi> beau to the boy with the down still on his cheek &mdash; ancient bachelors and young husbands alike had the open sesame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2071"/>In a larger city, never.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2072"/>It spoke volumes for the purity and simplicity of the society that for years it had gone on thus, and no necessity for any matronage had been felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>But now the case was different &mdash; a large promiscuous element of military guests was thrown into it; and it struck all that society must change its primitive habit. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>The reader may have gained some faint idea of the alacrity with which men of all classes rushed into the ranks; of the steady endeavor and unmurmuring patience with which they bore the toils and dangers of their chosen position; of their unwavering determination to fight the good fight to the end. That the same spirit as genuinely <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> pervaded the masses of the army now, there is little doubt; but the South-instead of husbanding her resources, had slept during these precious months the <rs>North</rs> utilized to bring <num value="0.5">a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> of men against her. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>When the <rs>Government</rs> had assumed more form and regularity with increased proportions and the conviction, forced upon the most obtuse mind, that a struggle was at hand demanding most perfect organization, the looseness of a divided system had become apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>The laws against any State maintaining a standing army were put into effect; and the combined military power was formally turned over, as a whole, to the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>This change simply meant that complete organizations were accepted as they stood, as soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> instead of soldiers of the states; the men were mustered into the <rs>Confederate</rs> service and the officers had their state commissions replaced by those from the <rs>Confederate</rs> <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>On the other hand, should the war last longer, in its very climax a large body of educated soldiers, just trained to a point <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> of usefulness, would have the right to demand their discharge, when their places would be difficult to fill even with raw levies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>The intent of the conscription was to put every man in the country, between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="35">thirty-five</num>, into the army; restricting <quote>details</quote> from the field within the narrowest limits of absolute necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>It retained, of course, every man already in the: field; and, had its spirit been vigorously carried out, would have more than doubled the army by midsummer. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>But the <quote>Bill of Exemptions</quote> left possible both of these things, at the same time that it failed to restrain abuses of privileges in certain high quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>The matter of <quote>details</quote> was, of course, essential; and it was only to be supposed that generals in the field could best judge the value of a man in another position than the front. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>But the most objectionable feature to the army was the <quote>Substitute law,</quote> which allowed any <num value="1">one</num> able to buy a man, not subject to the action of conscription, to send him to be shot at in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>Soldiers who had endured all perils and trials of the war, naturally felt that if they were retained in positions they objected to, those who had been comfortably at home-and in many instances coining that very necessity into fortunes &mdash; should be forced at the <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> hour to come and defend themselves and their possessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>Besides, the class of men who were willing to sell themselves as substitutes were of the very lowest order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>All citizens of the <rs>South</rs> were liable to conscription; and the <quote>exempts</quote> open to purchase, were either strange adventurers, or men over and under age, who-argued the soldiers &mdash; if fit for service should come of their own free will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>Veteran troops had a low enough opinion of the <quote>conscript</quote> as a genus; but they failed not to evince, by means more prompt than courteous, their thorough contempt for the <quote>substitute.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/></p> 
<p>These causes produced much discontent, where men would cheerfully have acquiesced in a law essential to the preservation of the fabric they had reared and cemented with their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>To quell this feeling, a reorganization of the army was effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>A certain time was allowed for any liable man to volunteer and choose his branch of the service and, if practicable, his regiment; and so great was the dread of incurring the odium of conscription, that the skeleton veteran regiments rapidly filled up to a point of efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>They were then <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> allowed to choose their own officers by election; and, though this lost to the service many valuable men who had become unpopular, still the army was better satisfied within itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>The refilled regiments were re-brigaded by states when practicable, a general from a different state being sometimes placed in command; and the whole army was divided into corps, of <num value="3">three</num> divisions each, commanded by a lieutenant-general. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>Whatever the weakness of its construction-and the abuses of the exemption and detail power in carrying it out &mdash; there can be little doubt that the conscription at this time saved the country from speedy and certain conquest; and credit should be given to the few active workers in the congressional hive who shamed the drones into its passage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>Had the men whose term expired been once permitted to go home, they could never again have been collected; the army would have dwindled into a corporal's guard here and there; the masses the <rs>North</rs> was pouring down on all sides would have swept the futile resistance before it; and the contest, if kept up at all, would have degenerated into a guerrilla warfare of personal hatred and vengeance, without a semblance of confederation, or nationality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>Once passed, the people of the whole country aquiesced in and approved the conscription, and gave all the aid of their influence to its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2409"/>Here and there a loud-mouthed demagogue would attempt to prejudice the masses against the measure; but scarcely a community failed to frown down such an effort, in the great extremity of the country, as vicious and traitorous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>Once set in motion, the machinery of conscription worked rapidly and somewhat smoothly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>The Camps of Instruction in all states not possessed by the enemy filled rapidly, and the class of conscripts on the whole was fairly good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>Then, too, at the beginning of the war it was reasoned that the northern <orgName n="Army of Invasion" type="army">army of invasion</orgName>, working on exterior lines, must necessarily be greater far in numbers and in cost, than the <orgName n="Army of Defense" type="army">army of defense</orgName>, working on interior lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>And now, looking back to the struggling and suffering South, <num value="1">one</num> asks with wonder how these results could have transpired. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>Unlike the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs>South</rs> went into the struggle with her whole soul and her whole strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>Every man came forward with <num value="1">one</num> accord, willing to work in the way he best might for the cause he held sacred; ready to give his arm, his life, and all he had beside, for the general good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>Whole regiments were put into service, armed, uniformed and equipped, without costing the central government <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure>; and in some instances &mdash; as of that spotless knight, true gentleman and pure patriot, Wade Hampton-raised by the energy, paid for by the generosity, and led to death itself by the valor of <num value="1">one</num> man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Corporations came into this general feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>Railroads put their rolling-stock and their power in the hands of the <rs>Government</rs>; agreeing, as early as the origin of the <rs>Montgomery</rs> government, to take their pay <hi rend="italics">at half rates</hi> and in government bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/><persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0014.0028.00230.00708" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> put their facilities and their circulation, manufacturers their machinery and foundries their material, at public disposition, for the bare cost of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Farmers and graziers cheerfully yielded all demanded of them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>And how the women wrought-how soft hands that had never worked before plied the ceaseless needle through the tough fabrichow taper fingers packed the boxes for camp, full from self-denial at home-shall shine down all history as the brightest page in story of noble selflessness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>In the deadly hail of hostile batteries; in the sweltering harvestfield of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and at the saddened and desolate fireside of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, the southern people wrought on-hoped on! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>And the result of all this willing sacrifice was greatly to reduce the burdens on the treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>For reasons before stated the southern army was smaller, and its transportation cost far less, than that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>Its equipment was far cheaper, and its subsistence for every reason infinitely smaller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/><pb id="p.231" n="231"/> </p> 
<p>Still, with an outlay per diem scarcely more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> that of the <rs>North</rs>--which amounted to near <measure n="4000000dollars" type="currency">$4,000,000</measure>! daily; with the teeming fields and bursting warehouses filled with cotton &mdash; a year back, auriferous in every fiber-worthless now; and with a people thus united to act and to aid it, the <rs>Southern Treasury</rs> continued to flood the country with paper issues, based only on the silver lining of the cloud that hung darker and ever darker over the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>With <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num></hi> the population in the field and the rest working for them, there was no real demand for this inordinate issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/><num value="1">One</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> the volume of currency properly distributed, with a coincident issue of bonds, would have relieved the actual necessities of buyer and seller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/>But still the wheels worked on-still Treasury notes fluttered out, until every bank and store and till was glutted with them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>Then the results of the inflation came with relentless and rapid pace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>With the people still convinced of the inevitable outcome of their united efforts; with the thinkers of the <rs>South</rs> still evolving their theories of the philosopher's stone to change all this mass of paper into gold; and with the press of the country blatant about the speedy and certain collapse of northern credit; above all, with <num value="1000000">millions</num> of pounds of cotton rotting in our warehouses-Confederate money, little by little, bought less and less of the necessaries of life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the change was very gradual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, persons coming to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs> spent their gold as freely as the <name>Treasury</name> notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>Then gold rose to <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="15">fifteen</num>, and finally to <num value="0.4">forty per cent.</num> premium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>There it stuck for a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>But the issues increased in volume, the blockade grew more effective, and misgivings about the <name>Treasury</name> management crept into the minds of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>Gold went up again, <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> at a jump, until it touched a <num value="100">hundred</num>--then rapidly to a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/><pb id="p.232" n="232"/> </p> 
<p>I candidly answered that I could not see the end of the inflation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/><quote> I do,</quote> Styles growled-<quote>Repudiation!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/></p> 
<p><quote>Well, that's no end of a nobby thing!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/></p> 
<p><quote>He can have the smoke, however,</quote> answered Styles more cheerily, as he hobbled over and gave a <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> note for a dozen cigars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>And this began rapidly to be the tone, everywhere out of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>A vague feeling of insecurity about the power of the <rs>Government</rs> to check the onward flood of issue prevailed in all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>This produced a reckless expenditure for anything tangible and portable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>And at last the colonel's prediction was verified; for money touched the <num value="2">two hundred per cent.</num>, and went up-up-by the <num value="100">one hundred</num>; until in a time incredibly short-and with such a suddenness that people had no time to be surprised &mdash; the <rs>Confederate</rs> treasury note stood still for a moment, worth <hi rend="italics"><num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="1">one</num></hi> for <hi rend="italics">gold</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>This may be accounted for, in small part, by the scarcity of supplies and the increasing efficiency of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>But it must be remembered that the value of gold remained a constant quantity and the gold dollar in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, note-flooded and blockade-bound, <hi rend="italics">bought more</hi> of almost any article than it ever had before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>With a string of active vessels watching every port and cove, to snap up the daring ventures between the island ports and the coast; with a powerful enemy thundering at every point of entrance to southern territory, still the fortunate man who had gold, or who could draw upon <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, or the <rs>North</rs>, actually lived much cheaper than in any place beyond the lines!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>Singular as this statement may appear, it is actual fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>At this moment-before the depreciation of currency became such as to give it no value whatever-board at the best hotels in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> per day-equivalent to $r in gold, while it was <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">$3</measure> in New York, or <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; a suit of clothes could be had for <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> or <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">$30</measure> in gold, while in New York it cost from <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">$60</measure> to <measure n="80dollars" type="currency">$80</measure>; the best whisky was <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">$25</measure> per gallon-$I. <num value="25">25</num> in gold, while in the <rs>North</rs> it was more than double. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/>Rapidly gold rose in the market, and in the absence of stocks became the only vehicle for financial gambling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>From time to time, as a brilliant success would grace Confederate arms, the fall of <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> Treasury credit would be checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>But it was only for the moment --and it went down steadily, rapidly, fatally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>And as steadily, as rapidly and as fatally did the <name>Treasury</name> shuttles fly; spinning out the notes, like a whirlwind in autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>And tighter grew the blockade, and fewer the means of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>Stocks on hand were long since gone; little came to replace them, and the rich were driven to great straits to live, while the poor almost starved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>Away from the army lines and great centers of cities, the suffering was dreadful; impressments stripped the impoverished people; conscription turned smiling fields into desert wastes; fire and sword ravaged many districts; and the few who could raise the great bundle of paper necessary to buy a meal, scarce knew where to turn in the general desolation, to procure it even then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>In the cities, it was a little better; but when beef, pork and butter in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> reached <measure n="35dollars" type="currency">$35</measure> per pound; when common cloth was <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">$60</measure> per yard, shoes <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure> to <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> per pair, and a barrel of flour worth <measure n="1400dollars" type="currency">$1,400</measure>, it became a difficult problem to fill <num value="1">one</num>'s stomach at any outlay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>And all this time the soldiers and Government employes were being paid on a gold basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>The private received <hi rend="italics"><num value="11">eleven</num></hi> (afterward <num value="21">twenty-one</num>) dollars per month-amounting at the end of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> to just <hi rend="italics"><measure n="55cents" type="currency">fifty-five cents</measure> in coin</hi>! At the last payments, before the final actions at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, the pay of a private for <num value="1">one</num> month was <hi rend="italics"><measure n="33cents" type="currency">thirty-three cents</measure></hi>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>Nor were officers of the army and navy better paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>With their rank in the old service guaranteed them, they also received about the same pay, when gold and paper money were of equal value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>Later Congress believed it would be a derogation from its dignity to <quote>practically reduce the value of its issues,</quote> as <num value="1">one</num> member said, <quote>by raising officers' pay.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>Thus a lieutenant in the navy, probably of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> experience, and with a family dependent upon him, though debarred from all other labor, received <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> per year &mdash; equal in gold to the sum of <measure n="4.25dollars" type="currency">$4.25</measure> per month; while a brigadier, or other higher general, received nearly <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">$8</measure> per month. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>These things would provoke a smile, did they not bring with them the memory of the anguished struggle to fight off want that the wives and children of the soldier martyrs made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>I have gone into detail further than space, or the reader's patience may warrant; and still, <quote>Behold, the half is not told!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/></p> 
<p>I would not, if I could, record the bitter miseries of the last <pb id="p.234" n="234"/> dreadful winter-paint the gaunt and ugly outlines of womanhood, squalid, famished, dying-but triumphant still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/><num value="1">One</num> case only will tell the tale for all the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/>Tears sprang into the woman's eyes as she answered, <quote>You mean kindness, major; but I have never asked charity yet. My husband is at the front; and I only ask a right &mdash; to be allowed to work for my children!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/></p> 
<p>Such were the sufferings, such the spirit of southern women! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>When it was too late-when the headlong road to ruin had been more than half-way run &mdash; some feeble attempts were made to stay the downward rush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>Of course, they were useless-worse than useless, in that they made widespread a feeling of distrust, already deepseated with reflecting men. The volume of currency had reached such expansion that its value was merely nominal for purposes of subsistence, when the devices of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0028.00234.00711" reg="nearbymention:Memminger,C.,G.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> to lessen it began to be pressed in earnest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>The people had now begun to see that the whole theory of the <name>Treasury</name> was false; that the moment for utilizing the cotton supply had indeed been lost; and they murmured loud and deep against the <rs>Secretary</rs> and the <rs>President</rs>; whom they believed not only retained him in office, but endorsed his destructive policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0028.00234.00712" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, the people said, was autocratic with his Cabinet, and would have displaced <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0028.00234.00713" reg="nearbymention:Memminger,C.,G.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> summarily, had he not favored that peculiar financial system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0028.00234.00714" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, too, was known to have been hostile to the absorption and exportation by the <rs>Government</rs> of all the cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>He had, moreover, recommended against any legislation by Congress to contract the currency and stop the issues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>Now, therefore, the inflation and utter inadequacy of the paper money was laid at his door, as well as <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0028.00234.00715" reg="nearbymention:Memminger,C.,G.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s; and the people, feeling there was no safety for them, began to distrust the good faith of such reckless issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>A system of barter was inaugurated among the country people; and they traded off things only needful for others absolutely essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/><pb id="p.235" n="235"/> They began to feel a dread of taking the notes of the <rs>Government</rs>, and in many instances refused them utterly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>And yet these very people yielded cheerfully to the constantly insolent, and not infrequently illegal, demands of the impressment officers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>In the cities, too, a point had been reached where the promise of the <rs>Government</rs> to pay was looked upon as a bitter joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>Bonds were constantly refused in business transactions, and only Treasury notes &mdash; as a medium of temporary exchange &mdash; were accepted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>Then, as a necessary measure, came the imperative order for funding the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>All the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of old issues were to be turned into the treasury, by a certain date, and exchanged for bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>If the unlucky holder could not, or would not, deposit or exchange, he lost <num value="0.33">thirty-three per cent.</num> of the value of the <rs>Government</rs> pledge he held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>The old issues went rapidly out of sight; but the measure did not appreciably lessen the current medium, while it <hi rend="italics">did</hi> very appreciably lessen the confidence in the integrity of the <name>Department</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>It is but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step in repudiation, thought the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>If Government will on any pretext ignore <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its obligation, what guarantee have we for the other <num value="2">two</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>And so, justly or unjustly, the country lost all faith in the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>Men became reckless and paid any price for any article that would keep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>Tobacco &mdash; as being the most compact and portable &mdash; was the favorite investment; but cotton, <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, merchandise-anything but the paper money, was grasped at with avidity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/>It has often been charged that speculators ruined the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>But, to give the children of the devil their due-we can scarcely think but that the currency made the speculators. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>Had the plain system been adopted, by which the currency dollar could have ever approximated to coin, it would have been simply impossible for the holders of supplies to have run prices up to extortionate figures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>Not that I would for <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">one instant</day></dateStruct> excuse, or ask any mercy for, those unclean vultures who preyed upon the dead credit of their Government; who grew fat and loathsome while they battened on the miseries of the brave, true men who battled for them in the front ranks of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>But while the fault and the shame is theirs, it may not be disguised that the door was not only left open for their base plundering, but in many cases they were urged toward it by the very hands that should have slammed it in their faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/><pb id="p.236" n="236"/> </p> 
<p>When we come to consider the question of the blockade, we may, perhaps, see this more clearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>Meantime, in glancing down the past by the light of experience, <num value="1">one</num> can not but marvel at the rapid, yet almost imperceptible, epidemic that fastened incurably upon the people, spreading to all classes and sapping the very foundations of their strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>In the beginning, as vast crowds poured into Richmond-each man with a little money and anxious to use it to some advantagetrade put on a new and holiday dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>Old shops were spruced up; old stocks, by aid of brushing and additions, were made to appear quite salable and rapidly ran off. The demand made the meat it fed upon, until stores, shops and booths sprang up in all parts of the city and on all the roads leading into it from the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>Graduallyfrom causes already noted-supplies became more scarce as money became more plenty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>The pinch began to be felt by many who had never known it before; and almost every <num value="1">one</num>, who had any surplus portables, was willing to turn them into money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>In this way, those who had anything to sell, for the time, managed to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>But the unfortunates who had only what they needed absolutely, or who were forced to live upon a fixed stipend, that did not increase in any ratio to the decrease of money, suffered terribly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>These were only too ready to take the fever of speculation; and to buy any small lots of anything whatever that might sell again at a profit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>This was the class from which the main body of amateur speculators was recruited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/><num value="1">One</num> successful venture led to another and gave added means for it. The clerk, or the soldier, who yesterday cleared his <num value="100">hundred</num> on a little turn in whisky, to-morrow might hope to double it-then reinvest his principal and his profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>It was marvelous how values rose over night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/><num value="1">One</num> might buy anything, a lot of flour &mdash; a line of fruits &mdash; a hogshead of molasses, or a case of boots to-day, with almost a certainty of nearly doubling his outlay to-day week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>The ordinary channels of trade became clogged and blocked by its constant increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>Auction houses became the means of brokerage; and their number increased to such an extent that half a dozen red flags at last dotted every block on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>. And incongruous, indeed, were the mixtures exposed at these sales, as well as in the windows of the smallest shops in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/>However much of ability may have been engaged upon it, the press of the <rs>South</rs>--up to the events just preceding the war-had scarcely been that great lever which it had elsewhere become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>It was rather a local machine than a great engine for shaping and manufacturing public opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/><num value="1">One</num> main cause for this, perhaps, was the decentralization of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3800"/>Tracts of country surrounding it looked up only to their chief city, and thence drew their information, and even their ideas on the topics of the day. But there it ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>The principal trade of the <rs>South</rs> went directly to the <rs>North</rs>; and in return were received northern manufactures, northern books and northern ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>Northern newspapers came to the <rs>South</rs>; and except for matters of local information, or local policy, a large class of her readers drew their inspiration chiefly from journals of New York-catholic in their scope as unreliable in their principles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>These papers were far ahead of those of the South-except in very rare instances &mdash; in their machinery for collecting news and gossip; for making up a taking whole; and in the no less important knowledge of manipulating their circulation and advertising patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>The newspaper system of the <rs>North</rs> had been reduced to a science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>Its great object was <hi rend="italics">to pay</hi>; and to accomplish this it must force its circulation in numbers and in radius, and must become the medium of communicating with far distant points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>Great competitionappli-cation of <foreign lang="fr">il faut bien vivre</foreign>-drove the drones from the field and only the real workers were allowed to live. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>In the <rs>South</rs> the case was entirely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>Even in the large cities, newspapers were content with a local circulation; they had a little-varying clientele which looked upon them as infallible; and their object was to consider and digest ideas, rather than to propagate, or manufacture them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3809"/><pb id="p.289" n="289"/> </p> 
<p>The deep and universal interest in questions immediately preceding the war, somewhat changed in the scope of the southern press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>People in all sections had intense anxiety to know what others, in different sections, felt on vital questions that agitated them; and papers were thus forced, as it were, into becoming the medium for interchange of sentiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3811"/>An examination of the leading journals of the <rs>South</rs> at this period will show that-whatever their mismanagement and want of business success &mdash; there was no lack of ability in their editorial columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/>Such organs as the <orgName n="New Orleans Delta" type="newspaper">New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Delta</hi></orgName>, <orgName n="Mobile Advertiser" type="newspaper">Mobile <hi rend="italics">Advertiser</hi></orgName>, <orgName n="Charleston Mercury" type="newspaper">Charleston <hi rend="italics">Mercury</hi></orgName> and <orgName n="Richmond Examiner" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi></orgName> and <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi> might have taken rank alongside of the best-edited papers of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>Their literary ability was, perhaps, greater than that of the <rs>North</rs>; their discussions of the questions of the hour were clear, strong and scholarly, and possessed, besides, the invaluable quality of honest conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>Unlike the press of the <rs>North</rs>, the southern journals were not hampered by any business interests; they were unbiased, unbought and free to say what they thought and felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>And say it they did, in the boldest and plainest of language. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3816"/>Nowhere on the globe was the freedom of the press more thoroughly vindicated than in the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>And during the whole course of the war, criticisms of men and measures were constant and outspoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>So much so, indeed, that in many instances the operations of the <rs>Government</rs> were embarrassed, or the action of a department commander seriously hampered, by hostile criticism in a paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>In naval operations, and the workings of the <rs>Conscript Law</rs>, especially was this freedom felt to be injurious; and though it sprang from the perfectly pure motive of doing the best for the cause-though the smallest southern journal, printed on straw paper and with worn-out type, was above purchase, or hush moneystill it might have been better at times had gag-law been applied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>For, with a large proportion of the population of different sections gathered in huge army communities, their different newspapers reached the camps and were eagerly devoured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>Violent and hostile criticisms of Government-even expositions of glaring abuses-were worse than useless unless they could be remedied; and when these came to be the text of camp-talk, they naturally made the soldiers think somewhat as they did. <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>Now, the greatest difficulty with that variously-constituted army, was to make its individuals the perfect machines-unthinking, unreasoning, only obeying &mdash; to which the perfect soldier must be reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>The newspapers gave him aid and comfort in both breaches of discipline; and in some instances, their influence against the conscription and impressments was seriously felt in the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>Still these hostilities had their origin in honest conviction; and abuses were held up to the light, that the <rs>Government</rs> might be made to see and correct them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>The newspapers but reflected the ideas of some of the clearest thinkers in the land; and they recorded the real and true history of public opinion during the war. In their columns is to be found the only really correct and indicative <quote>map of busy life, its fluctuations and its vast concerns</quote> in the <rs>South</rs>, during her days of darkness and of trial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>These papers held their own bravely for a time, and fought hard against scarcity of labor, material and patronage-against the depreciation of currency and their innumerable other difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>Little by little their numbers decreased; then only the principal dailies of the cities were left, and these began to print upon straw paper, wall papering &mdash; on any material that could be procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>Cramped in means, curtailed in size, and dingy in appearance, their publishers still struggled bravely on for the freedom of the press and the freedom of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>Periodical literature &mdash; as the vast flood of illustrated and unillustrated monthlies and weeklies that swept over the <rs>North</rs> was misnamed --was unknown in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3831"/>She had but few weeklies; and these were sturdy and heavy country papers-relating more to farming than to national matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3832"/>Else they were the weekly editions of the city papers, intended for country consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3833"/>Few monthly magazinessave educational, religious, or statistical ventures, intended for certain limited classes, were ever born in the <rs>South</rs>; and most of those few lived weakly and not long. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>Neither its great ability nor the taste of its <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> clientele availed to sustain the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>; and the <hi rend="italics">Messenger-long</hi> the chosen medium of southern writers of all ages, sexes and conditionsdragged on a wearisome existence, with <num value="1">one</num> foot in the grave for many years, only to perish miserably of starvation during the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>But any regular and systematized periodical literature the <rs>South</rs> never had. The principal reason doubtless is, that she had not the numerous class of readers for amusement, who demand such food in the <rs>North</rs>; and of the not insignificant class who did indulge in it, <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num>--for <num value="1">one</num> reason, or another, preferred northern periodicals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>This is not altogether unnatural, when we reflect that these latter were generally better managed and superior in interest &mdash; if not in tone --to anything the <rs>South</rs> had yet attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>They were gotten up with all the appliances of mechanical perfection; were managed with business tact, and forced and puffed into such circulation as made the heavy outlay for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class writers in the end remunerative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>On the contrary, every magazine attempted in the <rs>South</rs> up to that time had been born with the seeds of dissolution already in it. <hi rend="italics">Voluntary contributions-fatal</hi> poison to any literary enterprise-had been their universal basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>There was ever a crowd of men and women among southern populations, who would write anywhere and anything for the sake of seeing themselves in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>And while there were many able and accomplished writers available, they were driven off by these Free-Companions of the quill-preferring not to write in such company; or, if forced to do it, to send their often anonymous contributions to northern journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>These <num value="2">two</num> reasonsespecially the last-availed to kill the few literary ventures attempted by more enterprising southern publishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these <num value="2">two</num> in a great measure influenced the scarcity of book-producers, among a people who had really very few readers among them; and even had the number of these been larger, it seems essential to the increase of authors that,there should be the constant friction of contact in floating literature. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>Good magazines are the nurseries and forcing houses for authors; and almost every name of prominence in modern literature may be traced back along its course, as that of magazinist, or reviewer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>The South-whether these reasons for it be just or not, the fact is patent-had had but few writers of prominence; and in fiction especially the names that were known could be numbered on <num value="1">one</num>'s fingers.

<p>Even then her poetry proved that there was life-high, brave life --in the old land yet; even then it gave earnest that, when the bitter struggle for bread gave time for thought, reason and retrospect, southern literature would rise, in the might of a young giant, and shake herself wholly free from northern domination and convention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3945"/>In art and her twin sister, music, the <rs>South</rs> displayed taste and progress truly remarkable in view of the absorbing nature of her duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3946"/>Like all inhabitants of semi-tropic climes, there had ever been shown by her people natural love and aptitude for melody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3947"/>While this natural taste was wholly uncultivated-venting largely in plantation songs of the negroes &mdash; in districts where the music-master was <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> necessarily abroad, it had reached high development in several of the large cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3953"/>The bands of the southern army-so long as they remained existent as separate organizations &mdash; were indisputably mediocre, when not atrociously bad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3954"/>Nor was there either incentive to good music, or appreciation for it, among the masses of the fighters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3955"/>The drum and fife were the best they had known <quote>at musters;</quote> and they were good enough still, to fight by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3961"/>Such of these as displayed peculiar aptitude fcr painting, were usually sent abroad for perfecting; and returning, they almost invariably settled in northern cities, where were found both superior opportunities and larger and better-paying class of patrons.

<p>While neither in itself-perhaps not the combination of the twowas final and conclusive, the beginning of the end of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> may be dated from the loss of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and the simultaneous retreat from <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4260"/>For these <num value="2">two</num> disasters made all classes consider more deeply, both their inducing causes and the final results that must follow a succession of such crushing blows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4261"/>There can be little doubt that a complete victory at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, vigorously followed up, would have ended the war; and the generally-accepted belief in the <rs>South</rs> was that the exhaustive defeat was proportionately bad. The war had been going on <measure n="2.5years" type="date">two years and a half</measure>. Every device had been used to put the whole numerical strength of the country into the field and to utilize its every resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4262"/>The South had succeeded to a degree that stupefied the outside world and astonished even herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4263"/>But the effort had exhausted, and left her unfit to renew it. Over and again the armies of the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> had been re-enforced, reorganized and re-equipped-and ever came the heavy, relentless blows of the seemingly-exhaustless power, stluggled against so vainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4264"/>The South had inflicted heavy loss in men, material and prestige; but she wasted her strength in these blows, while unhappily she could not make them effective by quick repetition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4265"/>The people, too, had lost their early faith in the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>They had submitted to the most stringent levy of conscription and impressment ever imposed upon a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>They had willingly left their fields to grow weeds, their children to run wild and perhaps to starve; they had cheerfully divided their last supplies of food with the <rs>Government</rs>, and had gone to the front steadily and hopefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4268"/>But now they could not fail to see that, in some points at least, there had been gross mismanagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>The food for which their families were pinched and almost starved, did not come to the armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4270"/>Vast stores of provision and supplies were blocked on the roads, while <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> speculators' Ventures passed over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>This, the soldiers in the trench and the laborer at the anvil saw equally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4272"/>They saw, too, that the <rs>Government</rs> was divided against itself; for the worse than weak Congress &mdash; which had formerly been as a nose of wax in <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0035.00317.01169" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jeff,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>' fingers-had now turned dead against him. With the stolid obstinacy of stupidity it now refused to see any good in any measure, or in any man, approved by the <rs>Executive</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4273"/>Under the leadership of <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0035.00317.01170" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>--who wasted the precious time of Congress in windy personal diatribes against <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0035.00317.01171" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jeff,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his <quote>pets</quote> --nothing was done to combine and strengthen the rapidly sundering elements of Confederate strength; Long debates on <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n0014.0035.00317.01172" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>; weighty disquisitions on such grave subjects as the nulmber of pounds of pork on hand when <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was surrendered; and violent attacks on the whole <hi rend="italics">past</hi> course of the administration, occupied the minds of those lawgivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4274"/>But at this time there was no single measure originated that proposed to stop the troubles in thefuture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4275"/>Therefore, the people lost confidence in the divided Government;. and losing it began to distrust themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4276"/>Suffering so for it, they could not fail to know the terrible strain to which the country had been subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4277"/>They knew that her resources in men and material had been taxed to the limit; that there was no fresh supply of either upon which to draw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4278"/>This was the forlorn view that greeted them when they looked within.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4279"/>And outside, fresh armies faced and threatened them on every side-increased rather than diminished, and better armed and provided than ever before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4280"/>This state of things was too patent not to be seen by the plainest men; and seeing it, those became dispirited who never had doubted before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4281"/>And this time, the gloom did not lift; it became a settled and dogged conviction that we were fighting the good fight almost against hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4282"/>Not that this prevented the army and the people from working still, with every nerve strained to its utmost tension; but they worked without the cheery hopefulness of the past. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4283"/>Fate seemed against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4284"/>Had they been Turks they would have said: <quote>It is <hi rend="italics">kismet</hi>! Allah is great!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4285"/>As they were only staunch patriots, they reasoned: <quote>It is fearful odds-but we <hi rend="italics">may</hi> win.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4286"/>And so solemnly, gloomily-but none the less determinedthe <rs>South</rs> again prepared for the scarcely doubtful strife. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>The stringent addenda to the <name>Conscription</name> law &mdash; that had come too late &mdash; were put into force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>All men that could possibly be sparedand <pb id="p.318" n="318"/> whom the trickery of influence could not relieve &mdash; were sent to the front; and their places in the <rs>Government</rs> were filled by the aged, the disabled, and by women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4289"/>In the <rs>Government</rs> departments of Richmond-and in their branches further South--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ladies of the land took position as clerks-driven to it by stress of circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4290"/>And now as ever-whether in the arsenals, the factories, or the accountant's desk &mdash; the women of the <rs>South</rs> performed their labor faithfully, earnestly and well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4291"/>Those men who could not, possibly be spared, were formed into companies for local defense; were regularly drilled, mustered into service, and became in fact regular soldiers, simply detailed to perform other work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4292"/>When the wild notes of the alarm bell sent their frequent peals over <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and warned of an approaching raid-armorer, butcher and clerk threw down hammer and knife and pen, and seized their muskets to hasten to the rendezvous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>Even the shopkeepers and speculators, who seemed conscription-proof, were mustered into some sort of form; driven to make at least a show of resistance to the raid, by which they would suffer more than any others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>But it was only a show; and so much more attention was paid in these organizations to filling of the commissary wagon than of the cartridge-box, that the camps of such <quote>melish,</quote> in the woods around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, were converted more into a picnic than a defense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>Supplies of war material, of clothing, and of arms, had now become as scarce as men. The constant drain had to be supplied from manufactories, worked under great difficulties; and these now were almost paralyzed by the necessity for their operatives at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>Old supplies of iron, coal and ore had been worked up; and obtaining and utilizing fresh ones demanded an amount of labor that could not be spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>The blockade had now become thoroughly effective; and, except a rare venture at some unlooked &mdash; for spot upon the coast, no vessel was expected to come safely through the network of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>Blankets and shoes had almost completely given out; and a large proportion of the army went barefoot and wrapped in rugs given by the ladies of the cities, who cut up their carpets for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>Yet, in view of all this privation; with a keen sense of their own sacrifices and a growing conviction that they were made in vain, the army kept up in tone and spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>There was no intention or desire to yield, as long as a blow could be struck for the cause; and the veteran and the <quote>new issue</quote> --as the new conscripts were called in <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> derision of the currency-alike determined to work on as steadily, if not so cheerily, as before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>And still Congress wrangled on with Government and within itself; still <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0035.00319.01173" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName> blew clouds of vituperative gas at <rs type="role2">President</rs> and Cabinet; still <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0035.00319.01174" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jeff,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> retained, in council and field, the men he had chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>And daily he grew more unpopular with the people, who, disagreeing with him, still held him in awe, while they despised the <rs>Congress</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>Even in this strait, the old delusion about the collapse of Federal finance occasionally came up for hopeful discussion; and, from time to time, <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0035.00319.01175" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,Judah,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName> would put out a feeler about recognition from governments that remembered us less than had we really been behind the great wall of <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>After <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, came a lull in the heavier operations of the war. But raids of the enemy's cavalry were organized and sent to penetrate the interior <rs>South</rs>, in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>To meet them were only <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guards</orgName> and the militia; with sometimes a detachment of cavalry, hastily brought up from a distant point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>This latter branch of service, as well as <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, now began to give way. The fearful strain upon both, in forced and distant marches, added to the wearing campaigns over the <rs>Potomac</rs>, had used up the breed of horses in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>Those remaining were broken down by hard work and half feed; so that <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the cavalry was dismounted-belonging to <orgName type="company" n="Company Q">Company Q</orgName> the men called it-and the rest was scarcely available for a rapid march, or a very heavy shock. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>But the cavalry of the enemy had increased wonderfully in drill, discipline and general efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>Armed with the best weapons, mounted upon choice horses, composed of picked men and officered by the boldest spirits in the <rs>North</rs>, Federal cavalry now began tp be the most potent arm of their service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>Men sadly recalled the pleasant days when the brilliant squadrons of <persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n0014.0035.00319.01176" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Leethe,,Fitz,,," id="n0014.0035.00319.01177" reg="default:Leethe,Fitz,,,"><foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Leethe</surname></persName> flower of the <rs>South</rs>, mounted on its best blood stock-dashed laughingly down upon <num value="3">three</num> times their force, only to see them break and scatter; while many of their number rolled over the plain, by the acts of their own steeds rather than of hostile sabers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4311"/>Even much later, when the men were ragged and badly armed, and the horses were gaunt from famine, they still could meet the improving horsemen of the enemy and come off victors &mdash; as witness the battles of the <rs type="place">Fords</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4312"/>But now the <rs>Yankees</rs> had learned to fight-and more incomprehensible still to the <name>Reb</name>, they had learned to ride!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4313"/><pb id="p.320" n="320"/> They were superior in numbers, equipment, and &mdash; to be honest-in discipline; and could no longer be met with any certainty of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4314"/>It was a bitter thing for the <name>Golden</name> <rs n="horse shoe" type="product">Horse Shoe</rs> Knights; but like many ugly things about this time, it was true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4315"/>So the <rs>Yankee</rs> raids-aimed as a finality for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but ever failing approach to their object-still managed to do incalculable mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4316"/>They drove off the few remaining cattle, stole and destroyed the hoarded mite of the widowed and unprotected-burned barns-destroyed farming utensils; and, worse than all, they demoralized the people and kept them in constant dread. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4317"/>As a counter-irritant, and to teach the enemy a lesson, <persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n0014.0035.00320.01178" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, early in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, started on a raid into the <rs>Northwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4319"/>Great was the scare in the <rs>West</rs>, at this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taste the fine fruits of raiding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4320"/>Troops were telegraphed, engines flew up and down the roads as if possessed; and in short, <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guards</orgName>, and other troops, were collected to the number of nearly <num value="30000">30,000</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>Evading pursuit, and scattering the detached bands he met, <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0014.0035.00320.01179" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,,,:2"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> crossed the <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> line-tearing up roads, cutting telegraphs, and inflicting much damage and inconceivable panic-until he reached within <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>Of course, with his merely nominal force, he could make no attempt on the city; so, after <measure n="14days" type="date">fourteen days</measure> of unresting raiding-his command pressed, worn out and broken down-he headed for the river once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>A small portion of the command had already crossed, when the pursuing force came up. <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0014.0035.00320.01180" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,,,:2"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> made heavy fight, but his men were outnumbered and exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>A few, following him, cut their way through the enemy and fled along the north bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>The pursuit was fierce and hot; the flight determined, fertile in expedients, but hopeless in an enemy's country, raised to follow the cry. He was captured, with most of his staff and all of his command that was left-save the few <num value="100">hundred</num> who had crossed the river and escaped into the mountains of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>Then for <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>-until he dug his way out of his dungeon with a small knife-John <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0014.0035.00320.01181" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,John,,,:2"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> was locked up as a common felon, <pb id="p.321" n="321"/> starved, insulted and treated with brutality, the recital of which sickens-even having his head shave!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>There was no excuse ever attempted; no pretense that he was a guerrilla.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>There was a terrible shock to the people of the <rs>South</rs> in the fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>They knew its importance so fully that its loss was the more keenly felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>There came sudden revulsion from the hope that had begun once again to throb in the public pulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>The loud murmurs that had arisen after other defeats were wanting now; but a sullen and increasing gloom seemed to settle over the majority of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>It was as though they were stunned by the violence of the shock and felt already its paralyzing influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>Even the army itself-while still doggedly determined to strike its hardest to the bitter end-began to feel that it was fighting against hope. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>And in that <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> truce there was little chance for those worn and wasted battalions to recuperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>There were no fresh men to send to their aid; few, indeed, were the supplies that could be forwarded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>But they looked into the darkness ahead steadily and calmly; they might not see their path in it, but they were ready to march without the path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>And even as they watched and waited, <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> so at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> a small but sleepless <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> watched the grim <rs>Goliath</rs>, stretched in its huge bulk before their gates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>Ceaselessly the trains flashed back and forth over the iron link between those <num value="2">two</num> cities-now Siamese-twinned with a vital bond of endurance and endeavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>It is nowise within the scope of these sketches to detail that memorable siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, lasting nearly <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>It were needless to relate here, how &mdash; for more than <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure>--that long southern line of defense, constantly threatened and almost as constantly assailed, was held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>Men know now that it was not by strength, but by sleepless watch and dogged endurance, that less than <num value="30000">30,000</num> worn men-so dotted along works extending near <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>, that at points there was <num value="1">one</num> soldier to every rod of earthwork-held their own, even against the earlier onsets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>Men now realize why the <rs>Federal</rs> general-failing in every separate effort to buy. a key-position, even at the cost of <num value="6">six</num> lives for <num value="1">one</num>--was forced to sit down sullenly and wait the slow, but sure, process of attrition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>These matters are now stamped upon the minds of readers, on both sides of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>In the <rs>North</rs> they had voluminous reports of every detail; and the cessation of interest elsewhere gave full leisure to study them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>In the <rs>South</rs>, <num value="30000">30,000</num> earnest historians from the trenches were sought, each <num value="1">one</num> by eager crowds; and the story of every cannonade and skirmish and charge, told in honest but homely words, was burned into the memory of intent listeners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>Slowly that summer wore itself away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>Steadily that bloody history traced itself out; punctuated, now by many a fierce and sudden rush of crowding Federals-ever beaten back with frightful loss; again by rare sorties from our line, when our leaders saw the chance to strike some telling blow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>But spite of care in those leaders and superhuman endurance in the men, the southern troops were worn with watching and steadily melting away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>Close, ceaseless fighting thinned their ranks; there were no more men-even the youngest of the land, or its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> borns --to take the places of the lost veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0014.0038.00347.01469" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s words were strictly true-<quote>the <rs>South</rs> had robbed the cradle and the <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> grave</quote> The boasted army of the <rs>North</rs>, led by her latest-chcsen champion and strategist, was kept at bay by a skeleton of veterans, barely held together by the worn-out sinews and undeveloped muscle of old age and infancy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>Then the fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> came!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>The people were not to be deceived by platitudes about <quote>strategic purposes,</quote> or empty nothings about <quote>a campaign to nullify it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>They had gotten now beyond that; and saw the terrible blow that had been dealt them in all its naked strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>They felt that an army that had failed to check <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0014.0038.00348.01470" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, when it was behind strong works, would hardly do so in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>They felt that he could now at his leisure bore into the coveted heart of our territory; that the long-attempted <quote>bisection of the rebellion</quote> was accomplished; that further aid, or supplies, from that section was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>And then the people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> turned once more with unfailing pride, but lessening hope, toward the decreasing bands that still held their own gates secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>But they saw how the deadly strain was telling upon these; that the end was near. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>But even now there was no weak yielding &mdash; no despairing cry among the southern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>They looked at the coming end steadily and unflinchingly; and now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, they began to speculate upon the possible loss of their beloved Capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>It was rumored in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0014.0038.00348.01471" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had told the <rs>President</rs> that the lines were longer than he could hold; that the sole hope was to evacuate the town and collect the armies at some interior point for a final struggle that might yet sever the bonds, ever closing tighter and tighter upon us. And the rumor added that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0038.00348.01472" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> peremptorily and definitely rejected this counsel; declaring that he would hold the city, at any cost and any risk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>For once-whatever cause they had to credit these reports-the popular voice was louder on the side of the unpopular <rs>President</rs> than on that of the idolized general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>The tremendous efforts to capture the <rs>Capital</rs>; the superhuman exertions made to defend it in the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, <hi rend="italics">had made <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> the cause</hi>! People argued that if <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was lost, the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> was lost, too; that there was no point in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> where the army could make a stand, for even that <quote>interior line</quote> then became a frontier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>Beyond this the people felt the moral effect of such a step; and that the army, as such, <pb id="p.349" n="349"/> could never be carried out of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>And with the ceaseless discussion of this question, came the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> yearnings for peace propositions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>To this extremity, the <rs>South</rs> had been confident and fixed in her views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>Cheated of her hopes of foreign intervention, she had yet believed her ability to work out her own oracle; through blood and toil-even ruin, perhaps-but still to force a peace at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>But now the popular voice was raised in answer to the vague words of peace that found their way over the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>If there be any desire in the <rs>North</rs> for cessation of this strife, said the people, for <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake let us meet it half way. Even the <rs>Congress</rs> seemed impressed with the necessity of meeting any overtures from the <rs>North</rs>, before it was too late and our dire strait should be known there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>But it was already too late; and the resultless mission of <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n0014.0038.00349.01473" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> proved that the <rs>Washington Government</rs> now saw plainly that it could force upon us the terms it made the show of offering. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>The failure of this mission, no less than the great mystery in which the <rs>Government</rs> endeavored to wrap it, produced a decided gloom among the thinking classes; and it reacted upon the army as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/>The soldiers now began to lose hope for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>They saw they were fighting a hydra; for as fast as they lopped off heads in any direction, fresh ones sprang up in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>They began, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, to feel the contest unequal; and this depressing thoughtadded to the still greater privations following the loss of Georgiamade desertion fearfully common, and threatened to destroy, by that cause, an army that had withstood every device of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>And so the fall wore into winter; and the news from <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0014.0038.00349.01474" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s lines only added to the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>For a moment there was great exultation, for it was believed he would destroy the enemy's communications and then attack him, or force an attack on ground of his own choosing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>Great was the astonishment and great the disappointment, when <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n0014.0038.00349.01477" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> moved rapidly to <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> and thence into <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, leaving the whole country south of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> entirely open, defenseless, and at <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0014.0038.00349.01478" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s mercy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>Fragile, delicate women staggered under the heavy loads they bore to suffering children at home; the pale wife clutched hungrily at the huge ham, or the bag of coffee, for the wounded hero, pining at home for such a delicacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>Children were there with outstretched hands, crying for what they could carry; and hoary-headed men tugged wearily at the barrels of pork, flour, or sugar they strove to roll before their weak arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4821"/>Later in the evening, as the excitement increased, fierce crowds of skulking men, and course, half-drunken women, gathered before the stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4822"/>Half-starved and desperate, they swore and fought among themselves over the spoils they seized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4823"/>Orders had been given to destroy the whisky at once; but, either from lingering tenderness, or from the hurry of the movement, they were only partially obeyed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/>Now the uncontrolled swarms of men and women-especially the wharf rats at Rockett's where the navy storehouses were-seized the liquor and became more and more maddened by it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>Husbands hastily arranged what plans they might, for the safety of families they were forced to leave behind; women crept out into the midnight, to conceal the little jewelry, money or silver left them, fearing general sack of the city and treachery of even the most trusted negroes.

<p>Just as dawn broke through the smoke-eddies over the deserted Capital, the morning after its evacuation, <num value="2">two</num> carriages crept through the empty streets, toward the fortifications.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>Many a sad, a few terrified, faces peered at them through closed shutters; but the eager groups about the fires, striving still to secure scraps from the flames, never paused for a glance at the men who bore the form of the already accomplished fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>Before long, eager watchers from <placeName reg="Chimborazo Heights">Chimborazo Heights</placeName> saw bluecoats rise dim over the distant crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>Then came the clatter of cavalry, sabers drawn and at a trot; still cautiously feeling their way into the long-coveted stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>Behind followed artillery and infantry in compact column, up the <rs type="place">River Road</rs>, through Rockett's to <address><street n="Capitol Square">Capitol Square</street></address>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>It was a solemn and gloomy march; little resembling the people's idea of triumphal entry into a captured city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>The troops were quiet, showing little elation; their officers anxious and watchful ever; and dead silence reigned around them, broken only by the roar and hiss of flames, or the sharp explosion as they reached some magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>Not a cheer broke the stillness; and even the wrangling, half-drunken bummers round the fires slunk sullenly away; while but few negroes showed their faces, and those ashen-black from indefinite fear; their great mouths gaping and white eyes rolling in curious dread that took away their faculty for noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/><pb id="p.361" n="361"/> </p> 
<p>By the time <rs>Weitzel</rs>'s brigade of occupation had been posted-and several regiments massed on the <rs>Capitol</rs>--the fire had become general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>Intending only to destroy munitions and supplies of war-the firing party had been more hasty than discreet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>A strong breeze sprang up, off the river, and warehouse followed warehouse into the line of the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>Old, dry and crammed with cotton, or other inflammable material, these burned like tinder; and at many points, whole blocks were on fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>A dense pall of smoke hovered low over the entire city; and through it shone huge eddies of flames and sparks, carrying great blazing planks and rafters whirling over the shriveling buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>Little by little these drew closer together; and by noon, <num value="1">one</num> vast, livid flame roared and screamed before the wind, from <address><street n="10 Street">Tenth street</street></address> to Rockett's; licking its red tongue around all in its reach and drawing the hope &mdash; the very life of <num value="1000">thousands</num> into its relentless maw! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>Should the wind shift, that rapidly-gaining fire would sweep uptown and devour the whole city; but, while the few men left looked on in dismayed apathy, deliverance came from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>Down the deserted streets these marched; now hidden by eddying smoke-again showing like silhouettes, against the vivid glare behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>Once at their points for work, the men went at it with a will; and-so strong was force of discipline &mdash; with no single attempt at plunder reported! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>Military training never had better vindication than on that fearful day; for its bonds must have been strong indeed, to hold that army, suddenly in possession of city so coveted-so defiant-so deadly, for <num value="4">four</num> long years. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>Whatever the citizens may vaguely have expected from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00361.01508" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, what they received from it that day was aidprotection-safety!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>Demoralized and distracted by sorrow and imminent danger; with almost every male absent &mdash; with no organization and no means to fight the new and terrible enemy &mdash; the great bulk of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>'s population might have been houseless that night, but for the disciplined promptitude of the <rs>Union</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>The men worked with good will; their officers, with ubiquitous energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>If the fire could not be stayed, at any particular point, a squad entered each <pb id="p.362" n="362"/> house, bore its contents to a safe distance; and there a guard was placed over them, Sad and singular groups were there, too. <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>'s best and tenderest nurtured women moved among their household gods, hastily piled in the streets, selecting this or that sacred object, to carry it in their own hands &mdash; where?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>Poor families, utterly beggared, sat wringing their hands amid the wreck of what was left, homeless and hopeless; while, here and there, the shattered remnant of a soldier was borne, on a stretcher in kindly, if hostile, hands, through clouds of smoke and mourning relatives to some safer point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>Ever blacker and more dense floated the smoke-pall over the deserted city; ever louder and more near roared the hungry flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>And constantly, through all that dreadful day, the <hi rend="italics">whoo</hi> / of shells from magazines, followed by the thud of explosion, cut the dull roar of the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>For-whether through negligence or want of timecharged shells of all sizes had been left in the many ordnance stores when the torch was applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>These narrow brick chambers-now white hot and with a furnace-blast through them-swept the heaviest shells like cinders over the burning district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>Rising high in air, with hissing fuses, they burst at many points, adding new terrors to the infernal scene; and some of them, borne far beyond the fire's limit, burst over the houses, tearing and igniting their dry roofs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>Slowly the day, filled with its hideous sights and sounds, wore on; and slowly the perseverance of man told against the devouring element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>The fire was, at last, kept within its own bounds; then gradually forced backward, to leave a charred, steaming belt between it and the unharmed town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>Within this, the flames still leaped and writhed and wrangled in their devilish glee; but <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was now comparatively safe, and her wretched inhabitants might think of food and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>Little had they recked of either for many a dread hour past! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>, that unfailing adjunct to every occupation, had fixed his office at the court-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>There a mixed and singular crowd waited gloomily, or jostled eagerly, for speech of the autocrat of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>Captured officers stood quietly apart, or peered out earnestly through the smoke drifts, while their commitments to <placeName reg="Libby Prison">Libby Prison</placeName> were made out; anxious and wan women, of every sphere in life, besieged the clerk preparing <quote>protection papers;</quote> while a fussy <pb id="p.363" n="363"/> official, of higher grade, gave assurance to every <num value="1">one</num> that guards should be placed about their homes, For the deserted women of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> dreaded not only the presence of the victorious enemy, but also that of the drunken and brutalized <quote>bummers</quote> and deserters who stayed behind their own army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>The guards were really stationed as promptly as was practicable; the fire-brigade men were sent to quarters; pickets in blue patroled the outskirts; and, by nightfall, the proud Capital of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> was only a Federal barrack! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>For <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after their entrance the <rs>Union</rs> army might have supposed they had captured a city of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>The houses were all tightly closed, shutters fastened and curtains drawn down; and an occasional blue-coated sentry in porch, or front yard, was the sole sign of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>In the streets it was little different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>Crowds of soldiers moved curiously from point to point, large numbers of negroes mixing with them-anxious to assist their new found brotherhood, but wearing most awkwardly their vested rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>Here and there a gray jacket would appear for a moment &mdash; the pale and worn face above it watching with anxious eyes the unused scene; then it would disappear again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>This was all. The Federals had full sweep of the city &mdash; with its silent streets and its still smoking district, charred and blackened; where, for acre after acre, only fragments of walls remained, and where tall chimney stacks, gaunt and tottering, pointed to heaven in witness against the useless sacrifice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>For <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> this lasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>The curious soldiers lounged about the silent town, the burned desert still sent up its clouds of close, fetid smoke; the ladies of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> remained close prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>Then necessity drove them out, to seek food, or some means to obtain it; to visit the sick left behind; or to make charitable visits to those who might be even less provided than themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>Clad almost invariably in deep mourning &mdash; with heavy veils invariably hiding their faces &mdash; the broken-hearted daughters of the <rs>Capital</rs> moved like shadows of the past, through the places that were theirs no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>There was no ostentation of disdain for their conquerors --no assumption of horror if they passed a group of Federals-no affected brushing of the skirt from the contact with the blue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>There was only deep and real dejection-sorrow bearing too heavily on brain and heart to make an outward show &mdash; to even note smaller <pb id="p.364" n="364"/> annoyances that might else have proved so keen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>If forced into collision, or communication, with the northern officers, ladies were courteous as cold; they made no parade of hatred, but there was that in their cold dignity which spoke plainly of impassable barriers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>And, to their credit be it spoken, the soldiers of the <rs>North</rs> respected the distress they could but see; the bitterness they could not misunderstand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>They made few approaches toward forcing their society-even where billeted in the houses of the citizens, keeping aloof and never intruding on the family circle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>For several days the water-approaches to the city could not be cleared from the obstructions sunk in them; all railroad communication was destroyed, and the whole population was dependent upon the slender support of the wagon trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>Few even of the wealthiest families had been able to make provision ahead; scarcely any <num value="1">one</num> had either gold, or greenbacks; and suffering became actual and pinching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>Then came the order that the <rs>Federal</rs> commissary was to issue rations to those needing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>Pinching themselves, as they did; preferring to subsist on the slenderest food that would sustain life, to accepting the charity of the enemy-many of those suffering women were driven by sheer hunger-by the threatened starvation of their children, or of the loved wounded ones near them &mdash; to seek the proffered bounty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>They forced their way into the surging, fighting crowd of greasy and tattered negroes, of dark-faced <quote>bummers</quote> and <quote>loyal</quote> residents-and they received small rations of cornmeal and codfish; bearing them home to be eaten with what bitter seasoning they might of tears from pain and humiliation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>The direst destitution of the war had been nothing to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>With their own people around them, with hope and love to sustain them, the women of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> did not wince under the pinch of want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>But now, surrounded by enemies, with not a pound of flour, or a cent of currency, actual starvation &mdash; as well as humiliation-stared them in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>The few who went to draw rations, sat down in blank despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>They <hi rend="italics">could not</hi> make up their minds to go again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>The fewer still, who had the least surplus from immediate wants, distributed it freely; and a cup of sugar from a slender stock was bartered here for a few slices of the hoarded ham, or a pound or <num value="2">two</num> of necessary meal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>Meantime, sutlers, peddlers and hucksters swarmed in like locusts, <pb id="p.365" n="365"/> on the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> steamers up the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>They crowded <address><street n="Broad street">Broad street</street></address>, the unburned stores on Main, and even the alleyways, with great piles of every known thing that could be put up in tin. They had calculated on a rich harvest; but they had reckoned without their host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>There was no money in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to spend with them; and after a profitless sojourn, they took up their tin cans, and <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> returned North-certainly wiser and, possibly, better men. It was peculiar to note the universality of southern sympathy among these traders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>There was scarcely <num value="1">one</num> among them who didn't think the war <quote>a darned shame;</quote> they were intensely sympathetic and all came from South of the <placeName key="tgn,7007710" n="1.000 6" reg="pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</placeName> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>But the supporters, either of their principles, or their trade, were the few lucky negroes who could collect <quote>stamps,</quote> in never so small qualities; and to such the sutlers were a joy forever. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>Surely as this result should have been looked forward to-gradually as the popular mind had been led to it-still it came as a blow of terrific suddenness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>The people refused to believe it &mdash; they said it was a Yankee trick; and when the salute of <num value="100">one hundred</num> guns rang out from forts and shipping, they still said, bitterly, it was a ruse to make them commit themselves. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>False outcries were made every hour, only to result in sickening disappointment and suspense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>At last the evening of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day came and, just at dusk, a single horseman turned slowly into deserted <address><street n="Franklin street">Franklin street</street></address>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>At last <num value="1">one</num> fair wife, surrounded by her young children, stepped into the road and spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>The ice was broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>The soldier was surrounded; fair faces quivering with suspense, looked up to his, as <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> soft voices begged for news of--<quote>somebody's darling;</quote> and tender hands even patted the starved beast that had borne the hero home!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>The broad chest heaved as it would burst, a great sob shook the stalwart frame, and a huge teardrop rolled down the cheek that had never changed color in the hottest flashes of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>And then the sturdy soldier-conquering his emotion but with no shame for ittold all he could and lightened many a heavy heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>And up to his own door they walked by his side, bareheaded and in the roadway, and there they left him alone to be folded in the embrace of the mother to whom he still was <quote>glorious in the dust.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/></p> 
<p>Next morning a small group of horsemen appeared on the further side of the pontoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>By some strange intuition, it was known that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0014.0039.00367.01515" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was among them, and a crowd collected all along the route he would take, silent and bareheaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>There was no excitement, no hurrahing; but, as the great chief passed, a deep, loving murmur, greater than these, rose from the very hearts of the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>Taking off his hat and simply bowing his head, the man great in adversity passed silently to his own door; it closed upon him, and his people had seen him for the last time in his battle harness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>Later others came, by scores and hundreds; many a household was made glad that could not show a crust for dinner; and then for days <address><street n="Franklin street">Franklin street</street></address> lived again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>Once more the beloved gray was everywhere, and once more bright eyes regained a little of their brightness, as they looked upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>Then suddenly the reins were tightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th</day></dateStruct>, the news of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00367.01516" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s murder fell like a thunderclap upon victor and vanquished in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the news was not credited; then an indignant denial swelled up from the universal heart, that it was for southern vengeance, or that southern men could have sympathy in so vile an act. The sword and not the dagger was the weapon the <rs>South</rs> had proved she could use; and through the length and breadth of the conquered land was a universal condemnation of the deed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>But the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities-whether sincere in their belief, or not --made this the pretext for a thorough change of policy in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> came uniform orders, that none of the insignia, or rank marks, of the <rs>South</rs> should be worn &mdash; a measure peculiarly oppressive <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> to men who had but <num value="1">one</num> coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>Then came rules about <quote>congregations of rebels,</quote> and <num value="3">three</num> Confederates could not stand a moment on a corner, without dispersion by a <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost-guard</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>Finally came the news of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01517" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:7"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s surrender &mdash; of the last blow to the cause, now lost indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>Still this fact had been considered a certain <num value="1">one</num> from the date of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01518" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s surrender; and it bore none of the crushing weight that had made them refuse to believe in the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>Confident as all were in <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01519" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s ability to do all that man might, they still knew his numerical weakness; that he must ere long be crushed between the upper and nether millstones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>So this news was received with a sigh, rather than a groan. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>There was a momentary hope that the wise covenant between <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01520" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:7"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01521" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, as to the basis of the surrender, would be indorsed by the <rs>Government</rs>; but the result of its refusal and of the final surrender on the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num>--was after all little different from what all had expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>Even the wild and maddened spirits, who refused to accept <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01522" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s cartel, and started to work their way to <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01523" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:7"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, could have had no hope of his final success in their calmer moments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>But <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0014.0039.00368.01524" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:7"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s surrender did not lift the yoke from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, in any degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>Police regulations of the most annoying character were imposed; the fact of a parole bearing any significance was entirely ignored; no sort of grace was shown to its possessor, unless he took the oath; and many men, caught in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> at this time and far from home, were reduced to distress and almost starvation by the refusal of transportation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>All this the southern people bore with patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>They submitted to all things but <num value="2">two</num>: they would not take the oath and they would not mix socially with their conquerors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>In that respect the line was as rigorously drawn in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, at that time, as ever <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName> drew it against the <name>Austrian</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>Not that any attempt was omitted by the <rs>Federals</rs> to overcome what they called this <quote>prejudice.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>There was music in <address><street n="Capitol Square">Capitol Square</street></address>, by the best bands of the army, and the ladies were specially invited by the public prints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> went; and the officers listened to their own music in company with numbers of lusty black emancipated, who fully felt themselves women and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>Next it was given out that the negroes would not be admitted; but then the officers listened alone, and finally gave it up. Failing in <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> public, every effort-short of rudeness and intrusion, which were never resorted to &mdash; was made to effect a social lodgment in private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>But no Federal uniform ever crossed a rebel threshold, in those days, save on business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>The officers occupied parts of many houses; but they were made to feel that the other part, occupied by the household, was private still. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>Another infliction, harder to bear, was the well-meant intrusion of old friends from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>Pleasure parties to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were of constant occurrence; and for the time quite eclipsed in popularity, with the <rs>Washington</rs> idlers, the inevitable pilgrimage to <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111632">Mt. Vernon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>Gaily dressed and gushing over in the merriment of a party of pleasure, these visitors often sought out their <hi rend="italics">ante-bellum</hi> friends; and then and there would condone the crime of rebellion to them-sitting in desolation by the ashes of their household gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>It is not hard to understand how bitter was proffered forgiveness, to those who never admitted they could have been wrong; and perhaps the soft answer that turneth away wrath, was not always given to such zealously officious friends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>There was little bitterness expressed, however much may have fermented in the hearts of the captured; and, as a general thing, the people were grateful for the moderation of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, and appreciated the good they had done at the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>But, deeper than any bitterness could have sunk, was that ingrained feeling that there were <num value="2">two</num> peoples that these could never again mingle in former amity, till oil and water might mix. The men especially-and with much apparent reason &mdash; were utterly hopeless of the future; and, collecting in knots, they would gloomily discuss the prospect of emigration, as if that were the sole good the future held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>There can be little doubt that had the ability been theirs, a large majority of the young men of the <rs>South</rs> would have gone abroad, to seek their fortunes in new paths and under new skies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>Luckily, for their country, the commander at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> failed to keep his agreement with the paroled officers; and-after making out rolls of those who would be granted free permission and passage to <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or South Americathose rolls were suddenly annulled and the whole matter given up. Thus a number of useful, invaluable men who have ever since fought the good fight against that outrage &mdash; the imposition of negro dominance over her &mdash; were saved to the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/><num value="24">24</num> <pb id="p.370" n="370"/> </p> 
<p>And that good fight, begun in the natural law of self-preservation, has eventuated to the interests of a common country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>For no <num value="1">one</num> who does not intimately understand the character of the negro-his mental and moral, as well as his physical, constitution-can begin to comprehend the sin committed against him, even more than against the white man, by putting him in the false attitude of equality with, or antagonism to, the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, who did not move among the negroes, immediately after conquest of the South-and who did not see them with experienceopened eyes-can approach realization of the pernicious workings of that futile attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>Writing upon the inner details of the war and its resulting action upon the morale of the southern people, omission can not be made of that large and unfortunate class; driven-<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by blind fanaticism, later by fear of their own party-existence-into abnormal condition by the ultra radicals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>The negro rapidly changed; <quote>equality</quote> frittered away what good instincts he had and developed all the worst, innate with him. It changed him from a careless and thriftless, but happy and innocent producer, into a mere consumer, at best; often indeed, into a besotted and criminal idler, subsisting in part upon Nature's generosity in supplying cabbage and fish, in part upon the thoughtlessness of his neighbor in supplying chickens and eggs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>Yet-so powerful is result of habit; on so much foundation of nature is based the <name>Scythian</name> fable &mdash; the negroes of the <rs>South</rs>, immediately succeeding the surrender, used the new greatness thrust upon them with surprising innocence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>Laziness, liquor and loud asseverations of freedom and equality were its only blessings claimed; and the commission of overt acts, beyond those named, were rare enough to prove the rule of force of habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>Lured from old service for a time, most of them followed not far the gaudy and shining Will-o&lsquo;--the-Wisp; and almost all-especially the household and personal servants-soon returned to <quote>Ole Mas'r</quote> once more, sadder and wiser for the futile chase after freedom's joys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>But, even these were partly spoiled and rendered of far less practical use to themselves, or to their employers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>The <quote>negro question</quote> to-day is made merely a matter of politics, rather than <num value="1">one</num> of political economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>At the date of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>'s death, it is a matter of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>Little by little-forced by the necessities of themselves and of those still dearer-men went to work at new and strange occupations; doing not what they would, but what they could, in the bitter struggle with want for their daily bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>Little hands that had never held even a needle until the war, now wrought laboriously at the varied-sometimes even menial --occupations that the hour demanded.
