<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>No single work existed to inform the editors of this History systematically concerning that fighting and digging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>No single work described Federals and Confederates alike, and readably told the story of the great events with the guns and behind the ramparts from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/><num value="1">One</num> reason for this was that bronze and iron were used for making guns, and these metals could not withstand the exceedingly great pressures of heavy charges of powder unless the cannon were cast so large as to be unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>No scientific treatment of the subject of gun-strains had been attempted previous to this time, because it was assumed that all the powder in a charge was converted instantaneously into gas.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>However, as it was impossible to prevent the escape of the gas, the joint required for rapid loading was generally placed in front of the chamber, from which position the soldier suffered least from the discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>To facilitate loading, the mechanism of the gun was so arranged that, the paper or cloth cartridge having been broken or bitten open, the bullet acted as a stopper to hold the powder in place until the piece was closed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>The next improvement in ammunition was the introduction of the metallic cartridge-case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>These rimfire cartridges answered very well until the powder charges became heavier, when it was discovered that the weakening of the metal by folding to make the rim caused it to sheer off at the edge of the chamber of the gun, and the copper, of which they were made, would expand and render it almost impossible to extract the shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>And since the fulminate had to be placed entirely around the rim, a greater quantity was used than necessary for firing, and the distribution was imperfect, thus causing misfires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>A pin-fire cartridge was invented, but proved unsatisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>A pin projected from the rim and was intended to be struck by the hammer of the gun; but, of course, any object striking it would cause an explosion, and it was dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>The case formed a perfect gas-check; it gave the benefit of allowing a fulminate to be used in the case itself, which was an advantage over the former method of using a cap; there was a gain of time in that the piece did not have to be recapped with each new load; there was greater ease of loading, and the ammunition was waterproof.</p>
