<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>there is perhaps some temerity in publishing a work upon war, at the moment when the apostles of perpetual peace alone are heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But the industrial fever and the increase of riches expected from it, will not always be the only divinities to which societies will sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>War is ever a necessary evil, not only for elevating or saving States, but yet for guaranteeing even the social body from dissolution, as the illustrious <rs>Ancillon</rs> has so judiciously observed in his brilliant picture of the revolutions of the <rs>European</rs> political system.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>I am decided then upon the publication of this Summary, preceding it by some explanations upon the divers metamorphoses which it has undergone, and upon the motives which have prompted them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><name n="his Majesty" type="role">His Majesty</name> the <rs>Emperor</rs> having ordered the translation of my Treatise upon grand military operations, which had never been terminated as a complete work, I resolved <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to fill the omissions in it by writing, in <dateStruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Analytical Compend</rs> of the principal combinations of war. Executed rather precipitately, and conceived with the only object of serving as an appendant to my aforesaid Treatise, this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essay ought not to be considered as a separate work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Called last year to give it some developments in order to make it serve for the instruction of an august prince, I rendered it sufficiently complete to accord it a <hi rend="italics">brevet d'emancipation</hi> and to make of it a work independent of every other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Several new articles on wars of opinion and national wars, upon the supreme direction of the operations of war, upon the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of armies, upon lines of defense, upon zones and lines of operations, upon strategic reserves and transient bases, finally upon strategy in mountain warfare, on the manner of judging of the movements of the enemy and on grand detachments, have made of it an altogether new work, without speaking of the numerous ameliorations made in the other articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Despite those changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>however, it appeared at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> under its old title; but, yielding to the opinion of the publishers themselves, I was convinced of the necessity of giving it a new <num value="1">one</num> in order to distinguish it from the partial essays which had preceded it. I named it then <hi rend="italics">Summary of the art of war, or new analytical compend</hi>, (<hi rend="italics">precis de l'art de la guerre on nouveau tableau analytique</hi>,) &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I give the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> edition of this Summary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>as my last word upon the great speculative combinations of war; it will be augmented still by several interesting articles on the bases and fronts of operations, on logistics (<hi rend="italics">la logistique</hi>) or the practical art of moving armies, on remote grand invasions, on strategic lines, and manoeuvres for turning lines of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Besides that, almost all the other articles have received new developments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>Not having been able to extend farther investigations upon the practical details of the art to which my limits and my object are equally opposed, I have indicated the works in which those details are found taught as far as feasible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It is to the proper application of the speculative combinations of grand warfare that all those details ought to tend; but every <num value="1">one</num> will naturally proceed to this application according to his character, his genius, his capacity; here precepts become difficult and serve only as approximate landmarks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>I shall be happy if my readers find in this book the essential bases of those combinations, and if they accept it with kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>I ask pardon for its style, above all for the constant repetition of technical expressions; now that the art of making phrases has become so common, every <num value="1">one</num> has the right to be difficult; but the real merit of a didactic work, full of complicated definitions, is incontestably that of being perspicuous: now, to succeed in this, it is necessary to make up <num value="1">one</num>'s mind to those frequent repetitions of words and even of ideas which nothing could replace, and not to aim at elegance of phrases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>I shall be reproached perhaps with having pushed rather far the mania for definitions; but I own I make a merit of it: for in order to lay down the basis of a science until now little known, it is essential to have an understanding before all upon the different denominations that must be given to the combinations of which it is composed; otherwise it would be impossible to designate them and to qualify them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I do not dissemble that some of mine might yet be ameliorated, and as I have no pretension to infallibility, I am quite ready to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to admit those which should be more satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Finally, if I have often cited the same events as examples, I have decided to do so for the convenience of readers who have not all the campaigns in their memory or in their library.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It will suffice thus to be acquainted with the events cited in order to render the demonstrations intelligible; a greater series of proofs will not be wanting to those who are acquainted with modern military history.</p>

<head>Translators' preface.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In offering to the public a translation of the <quote><hi rend="italics">Precis de l'art de la Guerre</hi></quote> of <persName n="Jomini,General,,,," id="n0051.0001.00007.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jomini</surname></persName>, the undersigned are conscious that they have assumed a responsibility which should have devolved upon some officer of acknowledged professional attainments and experience, and the only motive they can plead in excuse of an enterprise so worthy of abler pens, is an earnest desire to see placed within the reach of every military reader, a book from which they themselves have derived so much interesting and valuable instruction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It is indeed strange that the works of the greatest military historian and critic of the age, have not, long since, all been translated into the <rs>English</rs> language; and the undersigned can only account for this omission upon the supposition that these works are necessarily very expensive, owing to the little encouragement they receive from the general reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Otherwise, the circumstance that no <num value="1">one</num> has yet been found in either the <rs>British</rs> or <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName> to undertake a labor which would reflect so much credit upon himself and render such an important service to the profession, must be regarded as reflecting upon the industry and enterprise of the officers of those armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It is possible that the undersigned are mistaken in their assumption that <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n0051.0001.00007.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>'s works are not translated into <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0051.0001.00007.00007" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, but if so, they can only reply that, after the most careful inquiries of the book sellers in this country, they have been able neither to find, nor hear of any such translations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It has often been urged, in discouragement of such enterprises, that those who are the most likely to read foreign military books prefer the originals to translations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>This objection is opposed to our experience and common sense, and is founded at best upon the assumption that a translator is less capable and less careful to render the author's meaning than will be the majority of his readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It is true that the <rs>French</rs> language, particularly, is a part of the course of instruction of every military school; but it is equally true that it is lost almost as soon as it is attained when the necessity or the will for its acquisition ceases to operate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Moreover, military studies are by no means confined to military colleges; and in this country, especially, students in the art of war are to be found in nearly all the occupations of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>To those students, whether in the military profession or not, the undersigned feel confident that they risk nothing in commending the book of which the following pages are an unpretending, but, as they trust, a faithful translation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Nothing has been added to, or subtracted from the original except a small map intended to illustrate the author's views upon lines of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>This map and the single paragraph <pb id="p.8" n="8"/>in the text referring thereto, have been omitted; the former increasing the cost of the work without a corresponding benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The same information can be conveyed to the intelligent reader by the ordinary school atlases of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It is not for the undersigned to go into any particular details as to the merits of the author, either as a writer or as a soldier; they have been recognized by the highest military authorities in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and rewarded in a conspicuous manner by the greatest military power in Christendom; a power remarkable for discovering this kind of merit and for turning it to its own account, whether found in a native or a foreigner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/><persName n="Jomini,General,,,," id="n0051.0001.00008.00008" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jomini</surname></persName> learned the art of war in the school of experience, the best and only finishing school of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>He served with distinction in nearly all the campaigns of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0001.00008.00009" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and it was mainly from the gigantic military operations of this matchless master of the art, that he was enabled to discover its true principles and to ascertain the best means of their application in the infinity of combinations which actual war presents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Those principles, he has laid down with so much clearness and precision, has illustrated them with so much force, and has supported them by so many incontestable facts drawn from the military history of all ages, that the reader rises from the perusal of his arguments with an irresistible conviction that he is at last possessed of the true secret of success in war, and that henceforth the chances of this great game of nations can be calculated with something approaching to certainty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>With such a guide then as <persName n="Jomini,,,,," id="n0051.0001.00008.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jomini,nomatch:0"><surname>Jomini</surname></persName>, the military student is in no danger of being lost in the labarynth of confused and conflicting maxims and systems of war; for with him everything is tried by the touchstone of a few distinct regulating principles, and whatever does not stand this test is unceremoniously rejected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>In conclusion, the most that the undersigned have to apprehend is, that they may not in every instance have rendered the author's ideas in all their force and integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>If they shall be fond to have succeeded in this, they will have accomplished all they could desire and more than they have a right to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Meanwhile they are not without hope that this, their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> undertaking of the kind, will at least have the effect to stimulate their brother officers of the army and militia to similar and more important enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>We may then reasonably expect to see, ere long, those vast stores of military science and literature which are hoarded up in the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>German</rs> languages, opened in all their rich and varied profusion to the <rs>American</rs> student.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>A consummation all the more to be desired that the policy of our government, in accordance with the universal sentiment and practice of the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0051.0001.00008.00011" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race, confides the defense of our territory to the citizen soldiery; thereby rendering it imperative to have choice works upon all the branches of the military art, in order, as far as possible, to make science supply the place of practical skill and experience in actual war.</p>

<head>Notice of the present theory of war, and of its utility.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>the summary of the art of war, which I submit to the public, was written originally for the instruction of an august prince, and in view of the numerous additions which I have just made to it, I flatter myself that it will be worthy of its destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>To the end of causing its object to be better appreciated, I believe it my duty to precede it by a few lines upon the present state of the theory of war. I shall be forced to speak a little of myself and my works; I hope I shall be pardoned for it, for it would have been difficult to explain what I think of this theory, and the part which I may have had in it, without saying how I have conceived it myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>As I have said in my chapter of principles, published by itself in <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, <hi rend="italics">the art of war has existed in all time</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">strategy</hi> especially was the same under <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00009.00014" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> as under <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00009.00015" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>But the art, confined to the understanding of great captains, existed in no written treatise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The books all gave but fragments of systems, born of the imagination of their authors, and containing ordinarily details the most minute (not to say the most puerile,) upon the most accessory points of tactics, the only part of war, perhaps, which it is possible to subject to fixed rules.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Among the moderns, Feuquires,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> 
<p>Feuquieres was not sufficiently appreciated by his cotemperaries, at least as a writer; he had the instiuct of strategy as Folard, that of tactics, and Puysegur that of <hi rend="italics">la logistique</hi>.</p></note> Folard and Puysegur had opened the quarry: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by very interesting, critical and dogmatical accounts; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> by his commentaries upon <persName n="Polybus,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00009.00016" reg="mostcommon:Polybus,nomatch:0"><surname>Polybus</surname></persName> and his treatise upon the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/>column; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> by a work which was, I believe, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> logistic essay, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> applications of the oblique order of the ancients.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>But those writers had not penetrated very far into the mine which they wished to explore, and in order to form a just idea of the state of the art in the middle of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> century, it is necessary to read what <persName n="Saxe,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0002.00010.00017" reg="mostcommon:Saxe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Saxe</surname></persName> wrote in the preface to his Reveries.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>All sciences have principles, war alone has yet none; the great captains who have written do not give us any; <num value="1">one</num> must be profound to comprehend them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>This was. written about the time when <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> preluded the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War by his victories of Hohenfriedberg, of Soor, &amp;c.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>At the end of the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War, some good works appeared; <placeName key="tgn,7016855;tgn,2002161;tgn,2047202" n="0.109 000000.5454	placename;tgn,7016855;frederick, frederick, maryland,Frederick,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.109 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2002161;frederick, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.055 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2047202;Fredericktown, Cecil, Maryland,Cecil,Maryland,United States,North and Central America" reg="frederick, frederick, maryland,Frederick,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;frederick, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Fredericktown, Cecil, Maryland,Cecil,Maryland,United States,North and Central America">Frederick</placeName> himself, not content with being a great king, a great captain, a great philosopher and great historian, made himself also a didactic author by his instructions to his generals.

But although the author has resolved none of those questions in a manner to make of them a connected system, it is necessary to render him the justice to say that he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pointed out the good route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>However, his narrative of the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War, of which he finished but <num value="2">two</num> campaigns, was more instructive (for me at least,) than all he had written dogmatically.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>I could not doubt this truth in reading again, subsequently, the campaigns of <persName n="Turenne,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00012.00037" reg="mostcommon:Turenne,nomatch:0"><surname>Turenne</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,2050078" n="1.000 4" reg="marlborough, middlesex county, massachusetts">Marlborough</placeName>, of <persName><foreName>Eugene</foreName></persName> of <placeName reg="Cluses, Haute-Savoie, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7009045">Savoy</placeName>, and in comparing them with those of <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName>, which Tempelhoff had just published with details so full of interest, although somewhat heavy and by far too much repeated.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Convinced that I had seized the true point of view under which it was necessary to regard the theory of war in order to discover its veritable rules, and to quit the always so uncertain field of personal systems, I set myself to the work with all the ardor of a neophyte.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>I wrote in the course of the year <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct>, a volume which I presented, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to M. d'oubril, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of the <rs>Russian</rs> legation at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, then to <persName n="Ney,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0002.00012.00039" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Ney</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> essay was a didactic treatise upon the orders of battle, strategic marches and lines of operations; it was arid from its nature and quite interspersed with historical citations which, grouped by species, had the inconvenience of presenting together, in the same chapter, events often separated by a whole century; <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00012.00043" reg="mostcommon:Lloyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> especially convinced me that the critical and argumentative <pb id="p.13" n="13"/>relation of the whole of a war had the advantage of preserving connection and unity in the recital and in the events, without detriment to the exposition of maxims, since a series of <num value="10">ten</num> campaigns is amply sufficient for presenting the application of all the possible maxims of war. I burned then my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> work, and re-commenced, with the project of giving the sequel of the <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war which <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00013.00044" reg="mostcommon:Lloyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> had not finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This mode suited me all the better, as I was but <measure n="24years" type="date">twenty-four years</measure> old and had but little experience, whilst I was about to attack many prejudices and great reputations somewhat usurped, so that there was necessary to me the powerful support of the events which I should allow to speak, as it were, for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>I resolved then upon this last plan, which appeared moreover, more suitable to all classes of readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Doubtless a didactic treatise would have been preferable, either for a public course, or for retracing with more ensemble the combinations of the science somewhat scattered in the narration of those campaigns; but, as for myself, I confess I have profited much more from the attentive reading of a discussed campaign, than from all the dogmatic works put together; and my book, published in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, was designed for officers of a superior grade, and not for schoolboys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The war with <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> supervening the same year, did not permit me to give the work all the care desirable, and I was able to execute but a part of my project.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Some years afterwards, the <rs>Arch Duke</rs> gave an introduction to his fine work by a folio volume on grand warfare, in which the genius of the master already showed itself.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Finally, <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> after my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> treatise on grand operations, appeared the important work of the <name>Arch</name> <persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0002.00013.00047" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName>, which united the <num value="2">two</num> kinds, didactic and historic; this prince having at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> given a small volume of strategic maxims, then <num value="4">four</num> volumes of critical history on the campaigns of <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, for developing their practical application.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Meanwhile, it must be owned, to render theory as complete as possible, there is an important work wanting, which, according to all appearances, will be wanting yet a long time; it is a thoroughly profound examination of the <num value="4">four</num> different systems followed within a century past: that of the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War; that of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaigns of the <name>Revolution</name>; that of the grand invasions of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00017.00080" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>; finally, that of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0002.00017.00081" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>I have sketched a view of this important labor, in article <num value="24">24</num>, chapter <num value="3">III</num>: but as the subject would require whole volumes, I have been obliged to limit myself to indicating the task to him who should have the courage and the leisure to accomplish it well, and who should at the same time be fortunate enough to find the justification of those mixed doctrines, in new events which should serve him as tests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>In the meantime, I will terminate this rapid sketch by a profession of faith upon the polemics of which this compend and my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> treatise have been the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>In weighing all that has been said for or against, in comparing the immense progress made in the science for the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, with the incredulity of <persName n="Clausewitz,,M.,,," id="n0051.0002.00017.00083" reg="default:Clausewitz,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Clausewitz</surname></persName>, I believe I am correct in concluding that the ensemble of my principles and of the maxims which are derived from them, has been badly comprehended by several writers; that some have made the most erroneous application of them; that others have drawn from them exaggerated consequences which have never been able to enter my head, for a general officer, after having assisted in a dozen campaigns, <hi rend="italics">ought to know that war is a great drama, in which a <num value="1000">thousand</num></hi> <pb id="p.18" n="18"/><hi rend="italics">physical or moral causes operate more or less powerfully, and which cannot be reduced to mathematical calculations</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>But, I ought equally to avow without circumlocution, that <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of experience have but fortified me in the following convictions: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/></p> 
<p>There exists a small number of fundamental principles of war, which could not be deviated from without danger, and the application of which, on the contrary, has been in almost all time crowned with success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The maxims of application which are derived from those principles are also small in number, and if they are found sometimes modified according to circumstances, they can nevertheless serve in general as a compass to the chief of an army to guide him in the task, always difficult and complicated, of conducting grand operations in the midst of the noise and tumult of combats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Natural genius will doubtless know how, by happy inspirations, to apply principles as well as the best studied theory could do it; but a simple theory, disengaged from all pedantry, ascending to causes without giving absolute t e systems, based in a word upon a few fundamental maxims, will often supply genius, and will even serve to extend its development by augmenting its confidence in its own inspirations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Of all theories on the art of war, the only reasonable <num value="1">one</num> is that which, founded upon the study of military history, admits a certain number of regulating principles, but leaves to natural genius the greatest part in the general conduct of a war without trammeling it with exclusive rules.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>On the contrary, nothing is better calculated to kill natural genius and to cause error to triumph, than those pedantic theories, based upon the false idea that war is a positive science, all the operations of which can be reduced to infallible calculations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Finally, the metaphysical and skeptical works of a few writers will not succeed, either, in causing it to be believed that there exists no rule for war, for their writings prove absolutely nothing against maxims supported upon the most brilliant modern feats of arms, and justified by the reasoning even of those who believe they are combatting them.</p></quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>I hope, that after these avowals, I could not be accused of wishing to make of this art a mechanism of determined wheelworks, nor of pretending on the contrary that the reading of a single chapter of principles is able to give, all at once, the talent of conducting an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>In all the arts, as in all the situations of life, <hi rend="italics">knowledge</hi> and <hi rend="italics">skill</hi> are <num value="2">two</num> allogether different things, and if <num value="1">one</num> often succeed through the latter alone, it is <pb id="p.19" n="19"/>never but the union of the <num value="2">two</num> that constitutes a superior man and assures complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Meanwhile, in order not to be accused of pedantry, I hasten to avow that, by <hi rend="italics">knowledge</hi>, I do not mean a vast erudition; it is not the question to <hi rend="italics">know a great deal</hi> but to <hi rend="italics">know well;</hi> to know especially what relates to the mission appointed us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>I pray that my readers, well penetrated with these truths, may receive with kindness this new summary, which may now, I believe, be offered as the book most suitable for the instruction of a prince or a statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Without doubt each of those wars can be offensive or defensive; even he who should be the aggressor will, perhaps, be anticipated, and reduced <pb id="p.26" n="26"/>to defend himself, and the attacked will be able to take immediately the initiative if he has known how to prepare himself for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It is conceived that a regiment ought always to fight very nearly the same, but it is not so with generals-in-chief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>To these different combinations, which belong more or less to diplomatic policy, may be added others, which have relation only to the conduct of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Let us commence by analyzing the combinations which relate to diplomacy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>When a state has rights over a neighboring country, it is not always a reason for claiming them by main force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The convenience of the public interest must be consulted before determining thereto.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The most just war will be that which, founded upon incontestable rights, shall yet offer to the state positive advantages, proportionate to the sacrifices and the chances to which it is exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But there present themselves unfortunately, in our day, so many rights contestable and contested, that the greater part of wars, although founded in appearance upon heritages, testaments and marriages, are in reality no more than wars of convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The question of the <rs>Spanish</rs> succession under <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>, was the most natural in right, since it reposed on a solemn testament supported by family ties, and by the general wish of the <rs>Spanish</rs> nation; nevertheless it was, <num value="1">one</num> of the most contested by all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; it produced a general coalition against the legitimate legatee.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The success and importance of this resolution made it a master stroke; for, if <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> had not succeeded, it would have been unjust however to blame him for it: the magnitude of the enterprise and its opportuneness could excuse such an irruption, as far as an inroad is excusable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>In such a war, there are no rules to give; <hi rend="italics">to know how to wait and to profit is everything</hi>. Offensive operations ought to be proportioned to the end proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is naturally that of occupying the provinces claimed; the. offensive can afterwards be pushed according to circumstances and the respective forces, to the end of obtaining the cession desired, <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>by menacing the adversary at home; all depends upon the alliances which <num value="1">one</num> will have been able to secure, and upon the military means of the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>the essential in such an offensive, is to have a scrupulous care not to awaken the jealousy of <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party, who might come to the succor of the power which it is proposed to attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>it is for policy to forsee this case, and to parry an intervention, by giving all the guaranties necessary to <num value="1">one</num>'s neighbors.

<div2 id="c.1.2" type="section" n="c.1.2"> 
<head>Article <num value="2">II</num>: wars defensive in policy and offensive militarily.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>A state attacked by its neighbor, who claims old rights upon a province, rarely decides to yield it without combat, and through pure conviction of those rights, it prefers to defend the territory demanded of it, which is always more honorable and more natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>But, instead of remaining passively on the frontier, awaiting its aggressor, it may suit it to take the initiative or offensive; all depends then on the reciprocal military positions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>There is often an advantage in making a war of invasion; there is often <num value="1">one</num> also in awaiting the enemy at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>A power, strongly constituted within itself, which has no cause for divisions, nor fear from <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> aggression upon its own territory, will always find a real advantage in carrying hostilities upon the enemy's soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>In the first place, it will avoid the ravaging of its provinces, then it will carry on the war at the expense of its adversary, finally it will put all the moral chances on its side, by exciting the ardor of its people, and striking the enemy on the contrary with stupor, from the commencement of the war. Meanwhile, under the purely military point of view, it is certain that an army operating in its own country, upon an <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> of which all the natural or artificial obstacles are in its favor or in its power, where all its manoeuvres are free and seconded by the country, by its inhabitants and its authorities, may expect great advantages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>These truths, which seem incontestable, are susceptible of being applied to every kind of war; but if the principles of strategy are immutable, it is <pb id="p.29" n="29"/>not the same with the truths of the policy of war, which undergo modifications through the moral condition of the people, the localities, and the men who are at the head of armies and of states.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>These are the divers shades which have given credit to the gross error that there are no fixed rules in war. We hope to prove that the military science has principles that could not be violated without defeat, when a skillful enemy has to be dealt with; it is the political and moral part of war alone which offers differences that cannot be subjected to any positive calculation, but which are nevertheless susceptible of being subjected to the calculations of probabilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It is necessary then to modify plans of operations according to circumstances, although in order to execute those plans it is necessary to remain faithful to the principles of the art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Doubtless a great State will be more sure of succeeding, than <num value="2">two</num> weaker States which should ally themselves against it; but yet is it better to have the reinforcement of a neighbor than to struggle alone; not only do you find yourself reinforced by the contingent which he furnishes you, but the enemy is enfeebled in a still greater proportion, for he will not have need merely of a considerable corps to oppose to that contingent, he will be obliged still to watch portions of his territory which otherwise would have been secure from insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It will be seen, in the following paragraph, that there are no allies so insignificant as to be disdained with impunity by a never so formidable State; a truth which, for the rest, could not be called in question without denying all the teachings of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Of all wars that a State can undertake, the most suitable, the most advantageous for it, is certainly the war of intervention in a struggle already engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The cause for it will easily be comprehended: a State which thus intervenes, puts in the balance all the weight of its power, in common with the power in favor of which it interferes; it enters therein when it wishes, and when the moment is most opportune for giving decisive action to the means it brings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/><pb id="p.31" n="31"/></p> 
<p>There are <num value="2">two</num> kinds of intervention: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that which a State seeks to introduce in the interior affairs of its neighbors, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is to intervene seasonably in its exterior relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Publicists have never been agreed as to the right of internal intervention; we shall not dispute with them upon the point of right, but we will say that the fact has often happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The <rs>Romans</rs> owed a part of their grandeur to those interventions, and the empire of the <rs>English Company</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> is no otherwise explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><hi rend="italics">Interior</hi> interventions do not always succeed; <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 6" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> owes in part the development of her greatness to that which her sovereigns knew how to bring into the affairs of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>; <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, on the contrary, came near being ruined for having attempted to interfere in the affairs of the <rs>French</rs> revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>These kinds of combinations are not in our province.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Intervention in the <hi rend="italics">external relations</hi> of <num value="1">one</num>'s neighbors, is more legitimate, more natural and more advantageous perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>In fact, doubtful as it is, that a State has the right to meddle with what passes within the interior jurisdiction of its neighbors, equally certain is it that it will be accorded the right to oppose whatever of trouble and disorder the latter may carry outside, which could reach it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/><num value="3">Three</num> motives may engage us to intervene in the exterior wars of our neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a treaty of alliance offensive and defensive, which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>engages us to sustain an ally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, is the maintainance of what is termed the political equilibrium: a combination of modern ages, as admirable as it appears simple, and which was, nevertheless, too often forgotten by those even who should have been its most fervent apostles.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> 
<p>To believe in the possibility of a perfect equilibrium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>would be absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>It can be but a question of a relative and approximate balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The principle of the maintainance of the equilibrium ought to be the basis of policy, as the art of putting in action the most possible forces on the decisive point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>is the regulating principle of war. Of course, the maritime equilibrium is an essential portion of the <rs>European</rs> political balance.</p></note> The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> motive, is to profit by a war engaged, not only with the object of preventing bad consequences from it, but also for causing the advantages of it to turn to the profit of him who intervenes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>History offers a <num value="1000">thousand</num> examples of powers which have decayed for having forgotten these truths: <quote>that a State decline when it suffers the immoderate aggrandizement of a rival State, and that a State, though it even be of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> order, can become the arbiter of the political balance, when it knows how seasonably to put a weight in that balance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/><pb id="p.32" n="32"/>This is enough to demonstrate the advantage of wars of intervention under an elevated political point of view.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>With regard to the military point of view, it is plain that an army, appearing as <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party in a struggle already established, becomes preponderant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Its influence will be all the more decisive, in proportion as its geographical situation shall have importance relatively to the positions of the <num value="2">two</num> armies already at war. Let us cite an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00032.00128" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> crossed the <name>Vistula</name>, and ventured under the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7012518" n="1.000 1" reg="konigsberg in bayern,unterfranken,bayern,deutschland,europe">Konigsberg</placeName>, having <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> in his rear, and the whole mass of the <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russian empire</placeName> before him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/><placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> preferred waiting to have its army increased to <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men; it took then the offensive with this formidable mass <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> after and was conquered; whilst that with a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men engaged at the proper moment, she would have decided more surely and more easily the fate of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>If interventions are of different natures, the wars which result from them are also of several kinds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/><num value="1">1</num>. You intervene as an auxiliary, in consequence of anterior treaties, and by means of secondary corps, the strength of which is determined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/><num value="2">2</num>. You intervene as a principal party, to sustain a more feeble neighbor, whose States you go to defend, which carries the theatre of war far from your frontiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/><num value="3">3</num>. You intervene also as principal party, when you are in the neighborhood of the theatre of war, which supposes a coalition of several great powers against <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/><num value="4">4</num>. You intervene in a struggle already begun, or before the declaration of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>When you intervene only with a moderate contingent, in consequence of stipulated treaties, you are but an accessory, and the operations are directed by the principal power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>When you intervene by coalition and with an imposing army, the case is different.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The military chances of those wars are various.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> army, in the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War, was, in reality, an auxiliary of <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>; it was, however, a principal party in the north, until the occupation of <pb id="p.33" n="33"/>Old Prussia by its troops; but when <persName n="Fermor,General,,,," id="n0051.0003.00033.00130" reg="mostcommon:Fermor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Fermor</surname></persName> and <persName n="Soltikoff,General,,,," id="n0051.0003.00033.00131" reg="mostcommon:Soltikoff,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Soltikoff</surname></persName> conducted the army into <placeName key="tgn,7016340" n="1.000 5" reg="brandenburg, meade, kentucky">Brandenburg</placeName>, then it no longer acted but in the <name>Austrian</name> interest; those troops, thrown far from their base, were at the mercy of a good or bad manoeuvre of their allies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Such remote excursions expose to dangers, and are ordinarily very delicate for the general of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The campaign of <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, and of <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, furnished sad proofs of this, which we shall recall in treating of those expeditions under the military aspect, (art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/><num value="30">30</num>.)</p> 
<p>It results from these examples, that those remote interventions often compromise the armies which are charged with them; but on the other hand, <num value="1">one</num> has the advantage that his own country at least could not be so easily invaded, since the theatre of war is carried far from his frontiers; what makes the misfortune of a general, is here a benefit for the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>In wars of this nature, the essential thing is, <hi rend="italics">to select a chief who is at once a politician and a military man; to stipulate well with your allies the part which each is to take in the operations; finally to determine an objective point which shall be in harmony with the common interests;</hi> it is by the neglect of these precautions that the greater part of coalitions have failed, or struggled with difficulty against a power less strong as a whole, but more united.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> kind of war of intervention, or of seasonableness, indicated above, that in a word which consists in intervening with all <num value="1">one</num>'s power, and in proximity with his frontiers, is more favorable than the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It is the situation in which <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> would leave been found in <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, had she known how to profit from her position; it is also that in which she was found in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Adjacent to <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName>, where <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00033.00132" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had just united his forces, taking in reverse, even the front of the <rs>French</rs> operations on the <rs>Elbe</rs>, she put <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men in the balance, with almost a certainty of success; the empire of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> and her influence over <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, lost through <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of reverses, were re-conquered in <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>. <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> had, in this intervention, not only the political chances, but moreover the military chances in her favor: a double result, which indicates the highest degree of advantages to which the chiefs of a State can aspire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The cabinet of <placeName reg="Wien, Wien, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName> succeeded all the more surely, as its intervention was not merely of the nature of those mentioned in article <num value="3">3</num>, that is to say, sufficiently contiguous to her frontiers to permit the greatest possible development of her strength, but because still she intervened in a struggle already commenced, in which she entered with all the weight of her means, and at the instant which suited her. <pb id="p.34" n="34"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>This double advantage is so decisive that we have seen, not only the great monarchies, but even very small States, become preponderant, by knowing how to seize this fitness of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/><num value="2">Two</num> examples will suffice to prove this.

<head>Article <num value="6">VI</num>: wars of invasion through a spirit of conquest or other causes.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It is important before all, to remark that there are <num value="2">two</num> very different kinds of invasions: those which attack neighboring powers, and those which are carried to a distance, traversing vast countries, that population of which might be more or less neutral, doubtful or hostile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Wars of invasion, made through a spirit of conquest, are not unfortunately always the most disadvantageous; <persName><foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00034.00134" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00034.00135" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in the half of his career, have only too well proved this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>However, those advantages have limits fixed by nature even, and which it is necessary to guard against crossing, because <num value="1">one</num> falls then into disastrous extremes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/><pb id="p.35" n="35"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Cambyses,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00035.00136" reg="mostcommon:Cambyses,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambyses</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,6004345" n="1.000 3" reg="nubia">Nubia</placeName>, <persName><foreName>Darius</foreName></persName> among the <name>Scythians</name>, <persName n="Crassus,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00035.00137" reg="mostcommon:Crassus,nomatch:0"><surname>Crassus</surname></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Julian</foreName></persName> among the <name>Parthians</name>, finally, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00035.00138" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 6" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, furnish bloody testimony to those truths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It must be owned, nevertheless, the mania for conquest was not always the only motive of the conduct of the latter; his personal position, and his struggle with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> urged him to enterprises, the evident object of which was to come out victorious in this struggle; love of war and its hazards was manifest in him, but he was still drawn on by necessity to bend under <persName n="England,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00035.00139" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> or to triumph in his efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/><num value="1">One</num> might say that he was sent into this world to teach generals of armies and statesmen all that which they ought to avoid; his vietories are lessons of skill, activity and audacity; his disasters are moderating examples imposed by prudence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>A war of invasion without plausible motives, is an outrage against humanity, like those of Zingis Khan; but when it can be justified by a great interest and a laudable motive, it is susceptible of excuses, if not even of approbation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, executed in <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, and that which had place in <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>, differ certainly as much in their object as in their results; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, dictated by a spirit of invasion, and. conducted with cunning, menaced the existence of the <rs>Spanish Nation</rs>, and was fatal to its author; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, combatting only dangerous doctrines, and looking to general interests, succeeded all the better that it found a decisive point of support in the majority of the people whose territory it for a moment violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We shall not undertake to judge them according to natural right; such questions belong to the political right of intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Far from discussing them, we merely present them here as proofs that an invasion is not always of the <rs>Zingis Khan</rs> species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> which we have just cited, contributed to the ruin of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00035.00140" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>; the other replaced <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> in the relative situation to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> which she ought never to have lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Let us entreat Heaven to render those invasions as rare as possible; but let us acknowledge that a State does better in invading its neighbors than in allowing itself to be attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Let us acknowledge also that the most sure means against fostering the spirit of conquest and usurpation is to know how to intervene at the proper moment for placing barriers to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Supposing then, a war of invasion resolved upon and justified, not upon an immoderate desire of conquest, but upon sound State reasons, it is important to measure this invasion by the object proposed and by the obstacles which may be encountered in it, either from the country itself, or from its allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><pb id="p.36" n="36"/></p> 
<p>An invasion against a people exasperated and ready for all sacrifices, who can expect to be sustained in men and money by a powerful neighbor, is a hazardous enterprise; the war of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0003.00036.00141" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, plainly proves this; the wars of the <rs>French Revolution</rs> in <dateStruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></dateStruct>, demonstrate it still better; for if this last power was taken, less unprovided than <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, neither had it a great alliance for assisting in its defence; it was assailed by all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, both by land and by sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>In view of such examples, of what interest could dry maxims be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>It is from the history of those great events that it is necessary to draw rules of conduct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The invasions of the <name>Russians</name> in <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, presented, in some respects, the same symptoms of national resistance; meanwhile it must be owned that the conditions were different; the religious hatred of the <name>Ottomans</name> might make them fly to arms; but settled in the midst of a Greek population twice as numerous as themselves, the <name>Turks</name> did not find, in a general insurrection, that support which they would have found if all the empire had been mussulman, or if they had mingled the interests of the <name>Greeks</name> with those of the conquerors, as <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> knew how to do with the people of Alsace, the best <rs>Frenchmen</rs> of the kingdom: in this case they would have been stronger; but there would have been no longer any religious fanaticism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The war of <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>, has proved that the <name>Turks</name> were respectable only on their frontiers, where were found united their most warlike militia, whilst the interior is falling into ruins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>When an invasion has nothing to fear from the people, and when it is applied to a bordering State, then there are strategic laws which decide in regard to it and which must above all be consulted; this is what rendered the invasions of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, so prompt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Those military chances will be treated of in Article <num value="30">30</num>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>But when on the contrary, an invasion is remote and is to traverse vast countries to arrive at its end, it is policy much more than strategy to which it is necessary to have recourse in order to prepare for its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>In fact, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> condition of this success will always be the sincere and devoted alliance of a power in the neighborhood of that it is wished to attack, since there will be found in its frank and interested concurrence, not only an increase of strength, but yet a solid base for establishing your depots beforehand, and for basing your operations, and finally, an assured refuge in case of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Now, in order to expect such an alliance, it is necessary that the power upon which you would count, have the same interest as yourself in the success of the enterprise.

<head>Article <num value="7">VII</num>: wars of opinion.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Although wars of opinion, national struggles and civil wars are sometimes confounded in the same conflict, they differ meanwhile sufficiently from each other to make it our duty to treat of them separately.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Wars of opinion present themselves under <num value="3">three</num> aspects: they are limited to an intestine struggle, that is to say, to civil war, or they are at the same time interior and exterior; it may happen also, but rarely, that they be confined to a conflict with the foreigner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Wars of opinion or doctrine between <num value="2">two</num> States,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> 
<p>I speak here of wars between <num value="2">two</num> powers and not of intestine wars, which make a separate article.</p></note> belong also to the class of wars of intervention, for they will always result either from doctrines which a party would impose upon its neighbors through propagandism, or from doctrines which it will be wished to combat and to put down, which leads in every case to intervention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>These wars, whether they arise from religious dogmas or from political dogmas, are not for that the less deplorable, for, as well as national wars, <pb id="p.38" n="38"/>they always excite violent passions which render them hateful, cruel and terrible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The wars of Islamism, those of the <name>Crusades</name>, the <measure n="30Years" type="date">Thirty Years</measure> War, Chose of the <name>League</name>, all offer, with more or less force, the symptoms of their species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Doubtless, religion was sometimes a political pretext or means, rather than an affair of dogmas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It is probable that the successors of Mahomet troubled themselves more with extending their empire than with preaching the <name>Koran</name>, and it was doubtless not for making the <orgName n="Rome Church" type="church">church of Rome</orgName> triumph, that <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName> sustained the <name>League</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>We agree even with <persName n="Ancelot,,M.,,," id="n0051.0003.00038.00142" reg="default:Ancelot,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Ancelot</surname></persName>, that <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="9">IX</genName></persName>, when he made his crusade to <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, thought more of the commerce of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> than of conquering the <rs>Holy Sepulcher</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>When it is thus, the dogma is not merely the pretext, it is also sometimes a powerful means, for it fulfills the double object of exciting the ardor of <num value="1">one</num>'s own people, and of creating for himself a party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>For example, the <name>Swedes</name>, in the <measure n="30Years" type="date">Thirty Years</measure> War, and <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, had in the, country an auxiliary more powerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>than their own armies, But it happens also that the dogma which is combatted for has none but enemies, and then the struggle is terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>This was the case with the struggles of Islamism and the <name>Crusades</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Wars of political opinions present nearly the same categories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>It is true that in <dateStruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></dateStruct>, extravagant societies were seen who really thought to spread the famous declaration of the rights of man over all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and governments, justly alarmed, took up arms doubtless with the only idea of rolling back the lava of this volcano into its crater and of stifling it therein.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But the means were not happy, for war and aggression are bad measures for arresting an evil which lies entirely in passions excited by a momentary paroxysm, all the less durable for being the most violent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Time is the true remedy against all bad passions, and against anarchical doctrines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>An enlightened nation may submit an instant to the yoke of an exasperated and factious multitude, but those storms pass away and reason returns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Attempting to arrest such a multitude by a foreign force is very like attempting to stay a mine at the moment when the match has just reached the powder and caused its explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Is it not wiser to allow the mine to spring and to fill the funnel afterwards than to be exposed to being blown up with it?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>A profound study of the <rs>French Revolution</rs> has convinced me that if the <name>Girondins</name> and the <orgName n="National Assembly" type="assembly">National Assembly</orgName> had not been menaced by <pb id="p.39" n="39"/>armaments, they never would have dared to lay a sacrilegious hand upon the feeble but venerable <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="16">XVI</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The <rs>Gironde</rs> would never have been crushed by the <rs type="place">Mountain</rs> but for the reverses of Dumouriez and the menaces of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>And if the parties had been left to jostle each other at their ease, it is probable that the <orgName n="National Assembly" type="assembly">National Assembly</orgName>, instead of giving place to the terrible convention, would have returned by degrees to the restoration of good monarchical doctrines tempered according to the wants and immemorial usages of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Considered under the military relation, those wars are terrible, for the invading army attacks not only the military forces of the enemy, but his exasperated masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>It may be objected, it is true, that the violence of a party will procure of itself a support by the creation of a contrary party; it is incontestable that this result is more certain still than in religious struggles; but if the exasperated party hold all the resources of the public strength, the armies, the places, the arsenals, and if it support itself upon masses the most numerous, what can the support of a party destitute of all those means effect?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>What were a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> Vendeans and a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> federalists able to do for the coalition of <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>History offers but a single example of a struggle like that of the <rs>French</rs> revolution, and it seems to demonstrate all the danger of attacking an excited nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Meanwhile, the bad conduct of the military operations could have contributed also to this result, and in order to be able to deduce certain maxims from this war, it would be necessary to know what would have happened if, after the flight of Dumouriez, the allies, instead of destroying the fortresses with cannon shots, and of taking possession of them in their name, had written to the commandants of those fortresses, that they wanted neither <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, nor its places, nor its brave army, and had marched with <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men upon <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Perhaps, they would there have restored the monarchy, but perhaps also they would not have returned, unless an equal force had protected their retreat upon the <rs>Rhine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>This is what would be difficult to decide, since the trial was never made, and everything would have depended in this case upon the course which the <rs>French</rs> army would have taken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The problem then presents <num value="2">two</num> equally grave hypotheses; the campaign of <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct> has resolved it but in <num value="1">one</num> sense: it would be difficult to resolve it in the other; it is to experience alone that like solutions belong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>With regard to the military rules to be given for these wars, they are nearly the same as those for national struggles; they differ; however, in <num value="1">one</num> capital point; it is that in the latter, the country ought to be occupied and subjected, the places besieged and reduced, the armies destroyed, all the provinces <pb id="p.40" n="40"/>subjugated; whereas, in affairs of opinion, it is not so much the object to subdue the country, and to occupy <num value="1">one</num>'s self with accessories; there are necessary sufficient means for moving directly to the end, without halting at any consideration of detail, and endeavoring, above all things, to shun whatever could alarm the nation as to its independence and the integrity of its territory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The war made in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>, and of which we have spoken in the preceding article, is an example to cite in favor of those truths, and in opposition to that of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Doubtless the conditions were somewhat different, for the <rs>French</rs> army of <dateStruct value="1792--"><year reg="1792">1792</year></dateStruct>, was composed of elements more solid than that of the radicals of the island of <placeName key="tgn,2035103;tgn,2070191" n="0.010 000000.0620	placename;tgn,2035103;leon, decatur, iowa,Decatur,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.002 000000.0124	placename;tgn,2070191;leon, cattaraugus, new york,Cattaraugus,New York,United States,North and Central America" reg="leon, decatur, iowa,Decatur,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;leon, cattaraugus, new york,Cattaraugus,New York,United States,North and Central America">Leon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The war of the <name>Revolution</name> was at once a war of opinion, a national and civil war, whilst, if the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> war with <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, was altogether national, that of <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct> was a partial struggle of opinions without nationality: hence the enormous difference in the results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The expedition of the <rs>Duke</rs> d'angouleme was, moreover, well conducted in regard to execution.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> 
<p>There were some faults committed under the triple relation, political, military and administrative but they were, it is said, the work of coteries which are never wanting at every general head quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>For the rest, the ensemble of the operations did honor to <persName n="Guilleminot,General,,,," id="n0051.0003.00040.00143" reg="mostcommon:Guilleminot,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Guilleminot</surname></persName>, who directed them under the prince, and who, according to the <name>Spaniards</name>, could claim the principal part of the success.</p></note> Far from amusing himself with taking places, his army acted conformably to the maxims above mentioned; after having pushed briskly to the <name>Ebro</name>, it was divided here to cut off at their sources, all the elements of the hostile strength, because it well knew that, seconded by a majority of the inhabitants of the country, it could be divided without danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>If it had followed the instructions of the ministry, who prescribed to it to subdue methodically all the country and places situated between the <placeName reg="Pyrenees" key="tgn,7016876">Pyrenees</placeName> and the <name>Ebro</name>, in order to base itself militarily, it would, perhaps, have failed in its object, or at least, rendered the struggle long and bloody, by rousing the national pride with the idea of an occupation like that of <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>But, emboldened by the good reception of all the population, it comprehended that it was an operation more political than military, and that it was a question of leading on rapidly to the end. Its conduct, very different from that of the allies in <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, merits the reflection of all those who should have like expeditions to direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>It was, therefore, in less than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> under the walls of <placeName reg="Cadiz, Cadiz, Andalucia" key="tgn,7007512">Cadiz</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Arbiter between <num value="2">two</num> hostile interests, <persName><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName></persName> blindly threw himself into the arms of that <num value="1">one</num> of the parties which affected a great veneration for the throne, but which counted to make the most of the royal authority for its own profit, without troubling itself about future consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Society remained divided into <num value="2">two</num> hostile camps, which it would not have been impossible to calm and to bring together in course of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>Those camps have come anew to blows, as I had predicted at <placeName reg="Verona, Verona, Veneto" key="tgn,7003262">Verona</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>; a great lesson, from which it appears for the rest, that no person is disposed to profit in this beautiful and too unhappy country, although history is not wanting in examples to attest that violent reactions are, no more than revolutions, proper elements for constructing and consolidating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>National wars, of which we have already been forced to say a few words in speaking of those of invasion, are the most formidable of all; this name can be given only to those which are made against a whole population, or at least against the majority of that population, animated by a noble fire for its independence; then every step is disputed by a combat; the army which enters into such a country holds in it only the field where it encamps; its supplies can only be obtained at the point of the sword, its convoys are every where menaced or carried away.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Such a movement may be produced by the most opposite causes: a serf people can be raised in mass at the voice of its government, and its masters even set the example by putting themselves at its head, when they are animated by a noble love for their sovereign and for their country; in tile sane manner a fanatic people arm themselves at the voice of their monks, and a people excited by political opinions, or by the sacred love they bear for their institutions, precipitate themselves to meet the enemy in order to defend what they hold most dear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The command of the sea enters for much in the results of a national invasion; if the people aroused has a great extent of coast, and is master of the sea, or in alliance with a power which commands it, then its resistance is centupled, not only through the facility had for feeding the fire of insurrection, of alarming the enemy on all points of the country which he occupies, but still by the difficulties which will be interposed to its supplies by the maritime route.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The nature of the country contributes also a great deal to the facility of a national defense; mountainous countries are always those in which a people is most formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Otherwise, what means would there exist of knowing when and how it would be suitable to excite a national war?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The difficulty of answering these <num value="2">two</num> questions thus proposed, would seem to militate in favor of national wars; but are there no means of repelling such an aggression without recourse to risings in mass, and a war of extermination?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Does there not exist a medium between those struggles of populations, and the ancient regular wars, made only by permanent armies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Does it not suffice, in order to defend a country well, to organize a militia or <hi rend="italics">landwehr</hi> which, clad in uniform, and called by government to intervene in the struggle, would regulate thus the part which the populations were to take in the controversy, would not put them entirely out of the pale of the laws of nations, and would place just limits to a war of extermination?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>For my part, I shall answer affirmatively, and in applying this, mixed system to the questions above propounded, I would guarantee that <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> <name>French</name> regular troops, supported by the <orgName n="National Guard" type="militia">national guards</orgName> of the <rs>East</rs>, would have an easy affair with that <name>German</name> army which should have crossed the <placeName reg="Vosges" key="tgn,1109783">Vosges</placeName>; for, reduced to <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men by a host of detachments, it would have, on arriving near the <name>Meuse</name>, or in the <name>Argonne</name>, more than a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men on its back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>It is precisely in order to succeed in this <hi rend="italics">juste milieu</hi>, that we have presented as an invariable maxim, the necessity of preparing for the army good national reserves; a system which offers the advantage of diminishing the expenses in time of peace, and of assuring the defense of the country in case of war.

<p>Let us return to the necessity of being well acquainted with the geography and military statistics of an empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The greater part of those reasonings are open to the same criticism; he has seen things too materially.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>But if these sciences are not publicly taught, the archives of the <rs>European</rs> staffs must be rich with valuable documents for teaching them, at least in the special schools of this corps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>In waiting for some studious officer to profit from those documents, published or unpublished, for giving the public a good military and strategical geography, it may, thanks to the immense progress which topography has made in our day, be supplied in part, by means of the excellent maps published within the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> in all countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>At the epoch of the commencement of the <rs>French</rs> revolution, topography was yet in its infancy; excepting the semi-topographical map of <placeName reg="Cassi">Cassi</placeName>, there was scarcely any but the works of Bakenberg, which would have merited that name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Military statistics is scarcely better known than geography; there are only a few vague and superficial tables, in which are thrown at hazard the number of armed men and vessels which a State possesses, as well as the revenues that it is supposed to have, which is far from constituting entirely a science necessary for combining operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>In general, a cherished cause, and a chief who inspires confidence by past victories, are great means for electrifying an army and facilitating its successes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Some military men have contested the advantages of enthusiasm, and preferred to it imperturbable sang-froid in combats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Both have advantages and inconveniences which it is impossible to mistake; enthusiasm leads to the greatest actions, the difficulty is to sustain it constantly; and when an excited troop is discouraged, disorder is introduced into it more rapidly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The greater or less activity and audacity in the chiefs of the respective armies is an element of success or of reverse which could not be subjected to rules.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>A cabinet and a general-in-chief ought to take into consideration the intrinsic value of their troops, and their constitutive force compared with <pb id="p.56" n="56"/>that of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>A Russian general, commanding troops the most solidly constituted in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, may undertake every thing in open field against undisciplined and disordered masses, however brave elsewhere may be the individuals who compose them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The action of the cabinet upon the armies has an influence also upon the audacity of their enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Would it be just, for that reason, to deny the influence of principles or of science, under ordinary circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Undoubtedly not, for this hazard even produces the finest triumph of principles, since they will be found applied by the army against which it was wished to employ them, and it will conquer through their ascendancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>But in yielding to the evidence of those reasons, it will be inferred from them, perhaps, that they militate against science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>That would not be better founded, since the science consists in putting on <num value="1">one</num>'s side all the chances possible to foresee, and it cannot be extended to the caprices of destiny.

<p>To these different conditions may be added a good system of clothing and equipment, for, if these articles have a less direct influence in the operations of the field of battle than the armament, they contribute, nevertheless, to the preservation of the troops; now, in the long run. an army which shall take the best care of its old soldiers, may hope for a notable superiority over young levies incessantly renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>It must be said none of these conditions could be neglected without grave conveniences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>A fine army well manoeuvred, well disciplined, but without skillful conductors, and without national resources, allowed <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> to fall in <measure n="15days" type="date">fifteen days</measure> under the blows of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00058.00184" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>On the other hand, it has been seen, in very many circumstances, how much a State ought to congratulate itself for having a good army; it was the care and the skill of <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00058.00185" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> in forming and instructing their phalanxes, which rendered those masses so movable, and so fit to execute the most rapid manoeuvres, and which permitted the <name>Macedonians</name> to subjugate <placeName reg="Iran" key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName> with that handful of choice soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>It was the excessive love of the father of <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> for soldiers, which procured this great king an army capable of executing all his enterprises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>A government which neglects its army under any pretext whatever, is then a government guilty in the eyes of posterity, since it prepares humiliations for its colors and its country, instead of preparing them for successes by following a contrary course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Far from us the thought that a government ought to sacrifice every thing for the army!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>This would be an absurdity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>But it ought to make it the object of its constant cares, and if the prince have not himself a military education, it is difficult to attain that end. In this case, which, unfortunately, happens but too often, it must be supplied by wise and provident institutions, at the head of which will be placed, without doubt, a good staff system, a good system of recruiting, and a good system of national reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>It is, especially in times of protracted peace, that it is important to watch over the preservation of armies, for it is then that they can more easily degenerate, and that it is important to maintain in them a proper spirit, and to exercise <pb id="p.59" n="59"/>them in great manoeuvres, very incomplete semblances, doubtless, of effective wars, but which incontestably prepare troops for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It is not less important to prevent them from falling into effeminacy, by employing them in labors useful for the defense of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The isolation of troops by reigments in garrisons, is <num value="1">one</num> of the worst systems that can be followed, and the <rs>Russian</rs> and Prussian formation by permanent divisions and corps d'armee, seems much preferable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>In general, the <rs>Russian</rs> army might at this day be offered as a model in a great many respects, and if, in many points, what is practiced therein, would become useless and impracticable elsewhere, we must acknowledge that in general, we could borrow from it many good institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>With regard to recompenses and advancement, it is essential to protect seniority of service, at the same time opening a door to merit; <num value="3">three</num> quarters of the promotions ought to be according to the order of the register, and the other quarter reserved to men who should make themselves remarkable by their merit and their zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Superiority of armament may augment the chances of success in war; it does not of itself gain battles, but it contributes to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>It is recollected also, what the <rs>French</rs> heavy cavalry have gained in adopting the cuirass, which it had so long repulsed; each <num value="1">one</num> knows finally, of what advantage is the lance; doubtless lancers as foragers are no better than hussars; but charging in line is a very different affair; how many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of brave horsemen have been victims of the prejudice they had against the lance, because it constrains a little more in carrying than the sabre!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The armament of armies is still susceptible of many improvements, and that <num value="1">one</num> who shall take the initiative in these ameliorations, will assure to itself great advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>We may then see again the famous gendarmerie, men and horses, all barbed with iron.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>In awaiting these circumstances, yet consigned to scarcely probable eventualities, it is certain that the artillery, and every kind of murderous pyrotechny, have made advances which ought to lead us to think of the modification of the deep order, which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00060.00187" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> abused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>We shall return to this subject in the chapter on tactics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Let us resume then, finally, in a few words the essential bases of the military policy which a wise government ought to adopt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/><num value="1">1</num>. Is to give to the prince an education at the same time political and military; he will find in his councils rather good administrators than statesmen and soldiers; he ought then to seek to be <num value="1">one</num> himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/><num value="2">2</num>. If the prince does not conduct his armies in person, the most important of his duties and the dearest of his interests will be that of causing himself to be well replaced; that is to say, to confide the glory of his reign and the security of his States, to the general the most capable of directing his armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/><num value="3">3</num>. The permanent army ought not only always to be found on a respectable footing; it must be in condition to be doubled at need by reserves wisely prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Its instruction and its discipline should be in accordance with its good organization: finally, the system of armament should be equal at least, if not superior, to its neighbors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/><num value="4">4</num>. The <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> should equally be upon the best footing, and to have the necessary reserves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/><num value="5">5</num>. It is important that the study of the military sciences be protected <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>and recompensed, as well as courage and zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>The corps to which those sciences are necessary ought to be esteemed and honored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>It is the only means of calling into them from all parts men of merit and genius.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/><num value="6">6</num>. The <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs> should be employed in time of peace in labors preparatory to all possible eventualities of war. Its archives ought to be found provided with numerous historical details of the past, and with all the documents statistical, geographical, topographical and strategical of the present and the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>It is essential then that the chief of this corps and a part of its officers be permanently in the <rs>Capitol</rs> in time of peace, and that the depot of war be nothing else than the depot of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, with the exception of a secret section to be given to it for documents which should be concealed from the subaltern officers of the corps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/><num value="7">7</num>. Nothing should be neglected to have the military geography and statistics of neighboring States, to the end of knowing their material and moral means of attack and defense, as well as the strategical chances of the <num value="2">two</num> parties; there should be employed in those scientific labors, distinguished officers, and they should be recompensed when they acquit themselves of them in a remarkable manner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/><num value="8">8</num>. War once decided upon, it is necessary to resolve upon, if not an entire plan of operations, which is always impossible, at least a system of operations in which there shall be proposed an object, and a base shall be assured, as well as the material means necessary for guaranteeing the success of the enterprise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/><num value="9">9</num>. The system of operations ought to be in unison with the object of the war, with the kind of enemies we will have to fight, with the nature and resources of the country, with the character of the nations and that of the chiefs who conduct them, either with the army or in the interior of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>It ought to be calculated upon the natural and moral means of attack or defense which the enemies may have to oppose to us; finally, we ought to take into consideration the probable alliances which may supervene for or against the <num value="2">two</num> parties in the course of the war, and which would complicate the chances of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/><num value="10">10</num>. The state of the finances of a nation should not be omitted in the list of the chances of war which we are called upon to weigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Nevertheless it would be dangerous to accord to it all the importance which <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> seems to attach to it in the history of his times This great <persName n="King,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00061.00188" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> may have been right at a time when armies were recruited in most part by voluntary enlistment; then the last crown gave <pb id="p.62" n="62"/>the last soldier; but if national levies are well organized, money will have no longer the same influence, at least for <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has proved that money procured soldiers and auxiliaries, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> has proved that love of country and honor equally gave soldiers, and that at need war supported war. Doubtless <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> found in the richness of its soil and in the exaltation of its chiefs, sources of transient power which could not be admitted as the general base of a system; but the results of its efforts were not less striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Each year the numerous echos of the cabinet of <persName n="London,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00062.00189" reg="mostcommon:London,nomatch:0"><surname>London</surname></persName>, and <persName n="D'Yvernois,,M.,,," id="n0051.0004.00062.00190" reg="default:D'Yvernois,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>D'Yvernois</surname></persName> especially, announced that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> was about to succumb for the want of money, whilst that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00062.00191" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was keeping up <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of savings in the <name>Tuileries</name>, at the same time cancelling regularly the expenses of the <rs>State</rs> and the pay of his armies.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> 
<p>There was a deficit at his fall, but there was none in <dateStruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></dateStruct>; it was the result of his disasters, and of the extraordinary efforts which he was required to make.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>A power which should abound in gold could badly defend itself; history attests that the richest people are not the strongest nor the happiest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Iron weighs as much at least as gold in the scales of military force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Meanwhile let us hasten to acknowledge the happy union of wise military institutions, of patriotism, of order in the finances, of internal riches and public credit, will constitute the strongest nation, and the <num value="1">one</num> most capable of sustaining a long war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>A volume would be necessary to discuss all the circumstances in which a nation may develop more or less of power, whether through gold or through iron, and to determine the case in which war may be supported by war. This result obtains only in directing your armies abroad, and all countries are not equally of a nature to furnish resources to an assailant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>We should go beyond our limits by treating thoroughly these matters; it will suffice, for the object which we propose, to indicate the relations which they have to a project of war; it is for the statesman to grasp the modifications which circumstances and localities may bring into those relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Before passing to the chapter on strategy, we shall terminate this sketch of the military policy of States, by a few observations upon the choice of generals-in-chief, upon the superior direction of the operations of war, and upon the military spirit to be impressed upon armies. </p></div2>

<head>Article <num value="14">XIV</num> command of armies, and the superior direction of military operations.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>There has been a great deal of argument as to the advantage and the inconveniences which would result to a State whose monarch should march in person at the head of his armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Whatever may be thought of it, it is certain, that if the prince feels within himself the capacity and the genius of a Frederick, of a Peter the <rs>Great</rs>, or of a Napoleon, he will take good care not to leave to his generals the honor of doing great things which he could do himself, for this would be wanting to his own glory, as well as to the good of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Not having the mission to debate whether warrior kings are better for the people than pacific ones, a philanthropic question, foreign to our subject, we must limit ourselves to acknowledging, that with equality of merit and of chances, a sovereign will always have the advantage over a general who shall not himself be the chief of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Without taking into the account that he is responsible only to himself for the bold enterprises which he might form, he will be able still to do a great deal through the certainty he will have of the disposition of all the public resources for arriving at the object which he shall propose to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>He will have moreover, the powerful vehicle of favors, of recompenses and of punishments; he will have the utmost devotion at his command for the greatest good of his enterprises; no jealousy will be able to trouble the execution of his projects, or, at least, it will be very rare, and will happen only far from his presence on secondary points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>These are doubtless motives sufficient for deciding a prince to put himself at the head of his armies, whenever he shall have a decided vocation to that effect, and the struggle shall be worthy of him. But if, far from having the genius for war, he is of a feeble character, and easy to circumvent, then his presence in the army, instead of producing any good, would open the way for every intrigue: each <num value="1">one</num> would offer him his projects and as he would not have the necessary experience to judge of the best, he would abandon himself to the counsels of his familiars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The general who <pb id="p.64" n="64"/>should command under him, constrained and thwarted in all his enterprises, would be out of condition for doing anything good, though even he should have all the talent necessary for conducting a war. It will be objected that the prince could well be present with the army, without constraining the generalissimo, by placing on the contrary all confidence in him alone, and aiding him with his sovereign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>In this case, that presence might produce some good, but it would often cause great embarrassment; if the army were ever turned, cut off from its communications, and obliged to open itself a way sword in hand, what sad results would not this position of the monarch at the head quarters produce?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>When <rs type="role" reg="Prince">the prince</rs> shall feel the necessity of placing himself at the head of his armies, but without possessing yet the confidence in himself necessary for directing every thing according to his own will, the best system which he can adopt, will be to imitate precisely what the <name>Prussian</name> government did with <persName n="Blucher,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00192" reg="mostcommon:Blucher,nomatch:0"><surname>Blucher</surname></persName>; that is to say, to call to his assistance <num value="2">two</num> generals the most famed for their capacity, the <num value="1">one</num> taken from among men of acknowledged executive qualities, the other taken from among the best instructed chiefs of the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>This trinity, if it agree well, can give excellent results, as had place in the army of <placeName key="tgn,7007552" n="1.000 5" reg="silesia">Silesia</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>The same system would be suitable also in the case where the monarch should judge it proper to confide the command to a prince of his house, as has frequently been seen since the time of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>. <rs type="role" reg="Prince">The prince</rs> was often decorated only with the titular command, whilst a counselor was imposed upon him who commanded in reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>This was the case with the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Orleans, Loiret, Centre" key="tgn,7008337">Orleans</placeName> and <persName n="Marsin,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00193" reg="mostcommon:Marsin,nomatch:0"><surname>Marsin</surname></persName>, at the famous battle of <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName>, then with the <rs>Duke</rs> of Burgundy and <persName n="Vendome,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00194" reg="mostcommon:Vendome,nomatch:0"><surname>Vendome</surname></persName>, at the battle of Oudenard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>I believe even that it was so at <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00195" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, between the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Ferdinand,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00196" reg="mostcommon:Ferdinand,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Ferdinand</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00197" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>This last mode is deplorable, for then, in fact, no person is responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that at <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName>, the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Orleans, Loiret, Centre" key="tgn,7008337">Orleans</placeName> judged with more sagacity than <persName n="Marsin,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0004.00064.00198" reg="mostcommon:Marsin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Marsin</surname></persName>, and the exhibition of full secret powers from the king was necessary, to cause the battle to be lost against the advice of the prince who commanded.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>We have said above, that if the prince does not himself conduct his armies, the most important of his duties will be that of causing himself to be well replaced, and this, unfortunately, is what scarcely ever happens.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Setting aside even all the chances taken in the nature of the human heart, it is just to acknowledge how difficult such selections are, even for Chiefs of the government the most ardent in their desires for the public welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>In the first place, to choose a skillful general, <num value="1">one</num> must be a military man himself, and in condition to judge, or else refer to the judgments of others, which involves necessarily the inconvenience of coteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The embarrassment is, doubtless, not so great, when there is at command a general already illustrious from many victories; but, besides that every general is not a great captain for having gained a battle, (witness <persName n="Jourdan,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00065.00206" reg="mostcommon:Jourdan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jourdan</surname></persName>, <persName n="Scherer,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00065.00207" reg="mostcommon:Scherer,nomatch:0"><surname>Scherer</surname></persName>, and many others,) it does not always happen that a State has a victorious general at its disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>After long intervals of peace, it might chance that no <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> general should have commanded-in-chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>In this case, it would be difficult to know by what title <num value="1">one</num> general should be preferred to another; those who, by long peace services, shall be at the head of the list, and shall have the grade requisite for commanding the army, will they be the most capable of doing it?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>Moreover, the communications of chiefs of the <rs>State</rs> with their subordinates, are so rare and so transient, that there is no occasion for astonishment at the difficulty of putting men in their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The faith of the prince, seduced by appearances, will then sometimes be surprised, and <pb id="p.66" n="66"/>with sentiments the most elevated, he can be deceived in his selections, without being liable to be reproached for it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/><num value="1">One</num> of the surest means for avoiding this misfortune, would seem to be to realize the fine fiction of <persName n="Fenelon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00066.00208" reg="mostcommon:Fenelon,nomatch:0"><surname>Fenelon</surname></persName> in <persName n="Telemachus,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00066.00209" reg="mostcommon:Telemachus,nomatch:0"><surname>Telemachus</surname></persName>, and to seek the faithful <rs>Philocles</rs>, sincere and generous, who placed between the prince and all aspirants to the command, would be able, by his more direct relations with the public, to enlighten the monarch as to the choice of individuals, the best recommended by their talents, as well as by their character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>But will this faithful friend himself never yield to personal affections?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It has been thought that public opinion would be the best guide; nothing is more hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>Has not public opinion mode a Caesar of Dumouriez, who understood nothing of great warfare?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Meanwhile it must be acknowledged that this opinion, if it be not always infallible, is none the more to be disdained, especially, when it survives great crises and the experience of events.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The qualities most essential for a general-in-chief will ever be: <hi rend="italics">A great character, or moral courage which leads to great resolutions; then sang-froid or physical courage which predominates over dangers</hi>. Knowledge appears but in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> rank; it were blindness not to acknowledge that it will be a powerful auxiliary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Moreover, as I have already said elsewhere, we must not understand thereby a vast erudition; it is not necessary to know a great deal, but to understand well, and above all to be deeply penetrated with regulating principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>At the end of all these qualities will come personal character; a man brave, just, firm, equitable, knowing how to esteem the merit of others instead of being jealous of it, and skillful in making it serve to his own glory, will ever be a good general, and may even pass for a great man. Unfortunately this eagerness to render justice to merit is not the most common quality, mediocre minds are always jealous, and inclined to surround themselves badly, fearing to pass in the world for being led, and not knowing how to comprehend that the man nominally placed at the head of armies has always nearly the entire glory of their successes, even though he should have the least part therein.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The question has often been agitated whether the command should be <pb id="p.67" n="67"/>given in preference to the general habituated from long experience to the conduct of troops, or to generals of the staff or scientific arms, little habituated, themselves to managing troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>It is incontestable that grand warfare is a science altogether separate, and that <num value="1">one</num> may very well combine operations without having himself led a regiment to the enemy; <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>, Conda,acute; <placeName key="tgn,7016855;tgn,2002161;tgn,2047202" n="0.005 000000.0248	placename;tgn,7016855;frederick, frederick, maryland,Frederick,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.005 000000.0248	placename;tgn,2002161;frederick, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.002 000000.0124	placename;tgn,2047202;Fredericktown, Cecil, Maryland,Cecil,Maryland,United States,North and Central America" reg="frederick, frederick, maryland,Frederick,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;frederick, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Fredericktown, Cecil, Maryland,Cecil,Maryland,United States,North and Central America">Frederick</placeName> and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00067.00211" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> are in point to prove it. It cannot be denied then that a man come from the staff may become a great captain as well as any other; but it will not be for having grown old in the functions of quarter-master that he will have the capacity for supreme command, it will be because he possesses in himself the natural genius for war and the requisite character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>In the same manner, a general from the ranks of the infantry or of the cavalry, will be as fit as a learned tactician to command an army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The question seems then difficult to resolve in an absolute manner, and here still individualities will be everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>In order to arrive at a rational solution, it is necessary to take a middle course and recognize:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>That a general of the staff, the artillery or engineers, who shall also have conducted a division or a corps d'armee, will have, with equal chances, a real superiority over him who shall only be acquainted with the service of <num value="1">one</num> arm or of a special corps;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>That a general of troops who shall have studied war will be equally proper for command;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>That great character precedes all the qualities requisite for a general-in-chief;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Finally that the union of wise theory with a great character will constitute the great captain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The difficulty of assuring constantly a good choice, has give rise to the idea of supplying it by a good staff, which, placed as advisers of the generals, would have a real influence over the operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Undoubtedly a superior staff corps, in which should be perpetuated good traditions, will always be <num value="1">one</num> of the most useful and happy of institutions; but it will be necessary to watch that false doctrines are not introduced therein, for then this institution would become fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Frederick the <rs>Great</rs>, in founding his <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">military academy</orgName> at <placeName reg="Potsdam, Potsdam, Brandenburg" key="tgn,7004463">Potsdam</placeName>, scarcely expected that it would terminate in the <hi rend="italics">rechte schulter vor</hi> of <persName n="Ruchel,General,,,," id="n0051.0004.00067.00212" reg="mostcommon:Ruchel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ruchel</surname></persName>,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/> 
<p>This General believed, at the battle of Gena, that he could save the army by commanding his soldiers to advance the right shoulder in order to form an oblique line!</p></note> and in presenting the oblique order as the infallible talisman, which causes the gain of battles: so true is it that from the sublime to the ridiculous there is often but a step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/><pb id="p.68" n="68"/></p> 
<p>Besides that, it would be necessary to avoid with great care exciting a conflict between the generalissimo and his chief of staff; and if the latter ought to be taken from amongst the best recognized notabilities of this corps, still it will be necessary to leave to the generals the choice of the individuals with whom he will best sympathise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>To impose a chief of staff on the generalissimo would be to lead to a confusion of powers; to allow him to take a man who is a cypher among his clients would be more dangerous still, for if he is himself a mediocre man, placed by favor or chance, his choice will be felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>The mean term for avoiding these evils, will be to give to the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, the choice amongst many generals of an incontestable capacity who will be designated for him, but leaving him to take the <num value="1">one</num> who shall sui him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>It has been thought also, in almost all armies successively, that more solemnity and weight would be given to the direction of military operations, by assembling often councils of war to aid the generalissimo with their advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Undoubtedly, if the chief of the army is a Soubise, a Clermont, or a Mack, a mediocre man in a word, he could often find in the <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> better opinions than his own; the majority even could make better decisions than he; but what success could be expected from operations conducted by others than those who have planned and combined them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>What will the execution of a project lead to, which the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> only half comprehends, since it will not be his own thought?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>I have had myself a terrible experience of this pitiful part of prompter at head quarters, and no <num value="1">one</num> perhaps can better than myself appreciate it at its just value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>It is especially in the midst of a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> that this part must be absurd, and the more numerous,the council, and the higher the military dignitaries of which it shall be composed, the more difficult it will be to cause truth and reason to triumph in it if there be ever so little dissidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>What would a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> have done in which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00068.00213" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in quality of counselor, should have proposed the movement of <placeName key="tgn,2026356" n="1.000 4" reg="arcola, douglas, illinois">Arcola</placeName>, the plan of <placeName key="tgn,7005763" n="1.000 10" reg="Rivoli,Torino,Piemonte,Italia,Europe">Rivoli</placeName>, the march by the <rs>St. Bernard</rs>, the movement of <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00068.00214" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and that upon <placeName reg="Gera, Como, Lombardia" key="tgn,7024451">Gera</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>The timid would have found those operations rash even to folly; others would have seen a <num value="1000">thousand</num> difficulties of execution; all would have rejected them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>If, on the contrary, the council should have accepted them, and another than <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00068.00215" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> should have conducted them, would they not certainly have failed?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Therefore, in my opinion, councils of war are a deplorable resource; it can only have <num value="1">one</num> favorable side, which is when the council is of the same <pb id="p.69" n="69"/>opinion as the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>It may then give to the latter more confidence in his own resolutions, and he will have, moreover, the conviction that each of his lieutenants, penetrated with the same idea as himself, will do his best to assure its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>This is the only good which a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> can produce, which, besides, ought always to be a council purely consultative and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>But if, in place of this perfect accord, there be dissidence, then such a council can have only unfortunate results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>From what precedes, I think it may be concluded, that the best manner of organizing the command of an army, when we shall not have a great captain, who has already given numerous proofs, will be:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/><num value="1">1</num>. To confide this command to a man of tried bravery, bold in combat, immoveable in danger;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/><num value="2">2</num>. To give him for a chief of staff, a man of high capacity, of a frank and loyal character, with whom the generalissimo may live in good harmony; the glory is sufficiently great to yield a part of it to a friend who should have concurred in preparing successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>It was thus that <persName n="Blucher,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00069.00216" reg="mostcommon:Blucher,nomatch:0"><surname>Blucher</surname></persName>, assisted by the <name>Gneisenaus</name> and Mufflings, covered himself with a glory which probably he never would have acquired all alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Without doubt, this kind of double command would never equal that of a Frederick, of a Napoleon, or of a Suwarof, but, in default of this unity of a great captain, it is certainly the preferable mode.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Before finishing upon these important matters, is remains for me yet to say a few words upon another manner of influencing military operations: it is that of councils of war established in the <placeName key="tgn,2220712;tgn,2115442;tgn,2061164" n="0.004 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2220712;Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah,Salt Lake,Utah,United States,North and Central America;0.004 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2115442;Capitol, Thurston, Washington,Thurston,Washington,United States,North and Central America;0.004 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2061164;Capitol, Carter, Montana,Carter,Montana,United States,North and Central America" reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah,Salt Lake,Utah,United States,North and Central America;Capitol, Thurston, Washington,Thurston,Washington,United States,North and Central America;Capitol, Carter, Montana,Carter,Montana,United States,North and Central America">capitol</placeName> near the government.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>As far as I am concerned, I think that the only attribute which such a I council should have, is reduced to the adoption of a general plan of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>It is already known that I do not understand by that, a plan which would trace out a whole campaign, would constrain generals and can <pb id="p.70" n="70"/>them to be beaten inevitably; but I understand the plan which should determine the aim of the campaign, the offensive or defensive nature of the operations, then the material means which it would be necessary to prepare beforehand for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enterprises, then for the reserves, then for possible levies in case of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>It cannot be denied that all these things may and even must be discussed, in a government council, composed of generals and ministers; but there, ought to be limited the action of such a council, for if it has the pretention to tell the generalissimo not only to march to <placeName reg="Wien, Wien, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName> or to <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, but still to indicate to him the manner in which he must manoeuvre in order to arrive there, then the poor general will be certainly beaten, and all the responsibility of his reverses will weigh upon those who, at <num value="200">two hundred</num> leagues from the enemy, pretend to direct an army, which it is already so difficult to direct well when <num value="1">one</num> is upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>It would be a subject worthy of the most serious consideration, that of comparing the ancient military institutions of <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName> with those of <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>, and of drawing afterwards the parallel between them and the doctrines of modern Utopists who, declaiming against all participation of the officers of the army in the other public functions, no longer wish any but rhetoricians in the great offices.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> 
<p>For example, in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, in place of excluding the military from elections, the right of elector ought to be given to all colonels, and that of eligibility to all generals; the most venal of the deputies will not be the military men.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Without doubt, there are many employments which require special studies; but would it not be possible for the military man to devote himself, in the numerous leisures of peace, to the study of the career which he should wish to embrace, after having paid his debt to his country in that of arms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>And if administrative places were given by preference to officers retired from service with the grade of captain at least, would it not be a great stimulant for them to seek to arrive at this grade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>Would it not also be a stimulant for officers to think, in their garrisons, of seeking their recreations elsewhere than in the theatres and public cafes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Perhaps it will be found that this facility of passing from the military service to places of civil administration, would be rather injurious than favorable to the military spirit, and that, in order to strengthen the latter, it would be suitable on the contrary to place the condition of soldier altogether beyond other careers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>The Janizaries and the <name>Mamelukes</name> had their origin in this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>These soldiers were bought at the age of <num value="7">seven</num> <pb id="p.72" n="72"/>or <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure>, and they were reared in the idea that they must die under their colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The <rs>English</rs> even, those men so proud of their rights, on becoming soldiers, contract the obligation for life ; and the <rs>Russian</rs> soldier must serve for <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>, which is almost equivalent to a life enlistment like that of the <rs>English</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>With such armies, as well as in those which are recruited by voluntary enlistment, perhaps it wouln be in fact, more suitable not to admit a fusion between the posts of military officers and civil places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>But, whenever the military service shall be a temporary duty imposed on the population, the case seems different, and the <rs>Roman</rs> institutions which required a service of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> in the legions, before being able to aspire to the various public functions, appears rather in effect the best means of preserving the martial spirit, especially at an epoch when the general tendency to material well-being, seems to become the dominant passion of societies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>However that may be, I think, that under all possible regimes, the constant aim of a wise government will be to elevate the military service to the end of nourishing the love of glory and all the warlike virtues, under penalty of incurring the blame of posterity, and of experiencing the fate of the <rs>Roman</rs> empire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>It will not be all to inspire the military spirit in the populations; it will be necessary still to encourage it in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>What, in fact, would be gained, though the uniform should be honored in the city aid imposed as a civic duty, if men did not carry under their colors all the warlike virtues?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>We should have a militia numerous, but without valor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The moral exaltation of an army and military spirit are <num value="2">two</num> very different things which we must take care not to confound, and which produce nevertheless, the same effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, as has been said, produced by passions more or less transient, such as political or religious opinions, and a great love of country; whilst that military spirit being inspired by the skill of a chief or by wise institutions, depends less on circumstances and ought to be the work of a far seeing government.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> 
<p>It is important especially that this spirit should animate the lists of officers and noncommissioned officers; soldiers always go well when those lists are good and the nation is brave.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Let courage be recompensed and honored, let the grades be respected, and let discipline be in sentiment and in conviction still more than in form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Let the body of officers and the ranks in general be convinced that resignation, bravery and the sentiment of duty, are virtues without which no <pb id="p.73" n="73"/>army is respectable, no glory possible; let all know well that firmness in reverses is more honorable than enthusiasm in successes, for there is only courage necessary for taking a position, whilst heroism is required for making a difflcult retreat before a victorious and enterprising enemy, without being disconcerted, and opposing to it a bold front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>It is the duty of the prince to recompense a handsome retreat as highly as the finest victory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>To harden the armies to labor and fatigue; not to allow them to be idle in the effeminacy of garrisons in times of peace; to inculcate in them the sentiment of their superiority over the enemy; without, however lowering the latter too much; to inspire the love of great actions; in a word, to excite enthusiasm by inspirations in harmony with the spirit which governs the masses; to decorate valor and punish weakness; and finally to brand cowardice; these are the means of forming a good military spirit,</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>It was effeminacy above all which was the ruin of the <rs>Roman</rs> legions; those formidable soldiers who carried casque, buckler and cuirass under the burning sky of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> in the days of the <name>Scipios</name>, found them too heavy under the cold sky of <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00073.00222" reg="mostcommon:Gaul,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>; then the empire was lost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>I have said that it is necessary never to inspire too much contempt for the enemy, because that where you should find an obstinate resistance, the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of the soldier might he shaken by it. <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00073.00223" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, addressing himself at <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> to the corps of Lannes, praised the <name>Prussian</name> cavalry, but promised that it could do nothing against the bayonets of his <persName><foreName>Egyptians</foreName></persName>!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>It is necessary also to forewarn the officers, and through them the soldiers, against those sudden turns which often seize the bravest armies when they are not restrained by the curb of discipline, and by the conviction that order in a troop is the pledge of its safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>It was not for the want of courage that a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> Turks were beaten at Peterwaradin by <persName><roleName n="Prince">the Prince</roleName> <foreName>Eugene</foreName></persName>, and at Kagoul by Roumanzof; it was because that once repulsed in their disorderly charges, each <num value="1">one</num> found himself delivered to his personal inspirations, all fighting individually without any order in the masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>A troop seized with panic finds itself in the same state of demoralization, for disorder being once introduced, all concert and all ensemble in the individual wills becomes impossible; the voice of the chiefs can no longer make itself heard; every manoeuvre for re-establishing the combat becomes impossible of execution, and then there remains safety only in a shameful flight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>The people of lively and ardent imagination are more subject than <pb id="p.74" n="74"/>others to these panics, and those of the south are almost all in this category.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The remedy is in strong institutions and skillful chiefs alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>The <rs>French</rs> even, whose military virtues have never been questioned when they have been well conducted, have often witnessed those alarms which it is permitted to call rediculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Who does not recall the inconceivable panic terror with which the infantry of <persName n="Villars,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0004.00074.00224" reg="mostcommon:Villars,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Villars</surname></persName> was seized after having gained the battle of Friedlingen (<dateStruct value="1704--"><year reg="1704">1704</year></dateStruct>)? The same thing had place in the infantry of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0004.00074.00225" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> after the victory of <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName>, when the enemy was in full retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>And, what is more extraordinary still, is the rout of the <num value="97" type="ordinal">97th</num> demi-brigade at the seige of <placeName key="tgn,7008546" n="1.000 5" reg="genova,genova,liguria,italia,europe">Genoa</placeName>, where <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men fled before a platoon of hussars, whilst that those same men took <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after the <rs>Diamond Fort</rs> by <num value="1">one</num> of the most vigorous coups-de-main of modern history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>It would seem, nevertheless, very easy to convince brave soldiers that death strikes more quickly and more surely men flying in disorder, than those who remian united to present a bold front to the enemy, or rally promptly if they happen to be momentarily forced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> army in this respect, may serve as a model for all those of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and the steadiness which it has displayed in all its retreats, belong as much to the national character as to the national instinct of the soldiers and to the establishment of a rigid discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>It is not indeed always the vivacity of imagination of troops which introduces disorder among them, the want of habits of order has much to do with it, and the want of precautions in the chiefs to assure the maintainance of them, contributes still more to it. I have been often astonished at the indifference of the greater part of generals on this subject; not only did they disdain to take the least logistic precaution for assuring the direction of small detachments and isolated men, they adopted no rallying signals in order to facilitate, in the different corps of an army, the reunion of the fractions which might be scattered in consequence of a sudden terror, or even an irresistible charge of the enemy; but they were even offended that any <num value="1">one</num> should think of proposing to them such precautions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>In the meantime the most incontestable courage, and the severest discipline would be often impotent for remedying a great disorder, which the good habit of division rallying signals would much more easily obviate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Without doubt there are cases where all human resources would be insufficient for the maintainance of order; such, for example, is that where the physical sufferings to which the troops should find themselves a prey, should have succeeded in rendering them deaf to all kinds of appeal, and where the chiefs themselves should be unable to do anything to reorganize them; this is what happened in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>But beyond these <pb id="p.75" n="75"/>exceptionable cases, good habits of order, good logistic precautions, and a good discipline will succeed the most often, if not in preventing all panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>at least in carrying a prompt remedy thereto.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>the art of war, independently of the parts which we have just succinctly explained, is composed yet, as has been seen above, of <num value="5">five</num> principal branches: strategy, grand tactics, logistics, (<foreign lang="fr">la logistique</foreign>) elementary tactics, (<foreign lang="fr">la tactique de detail</foreign>,) and the art of the engineer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>We shall treat only of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="3">three</num>, for reasons already indicated; it is necessary then to commence by defining them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>In order to do so more surely, we shall follow the order in which the combinations which an army may have to make, present themselves to its chiefs at the moment when war is declared ; commencing naturally with the most important, which constitute in some sort the plan of operations, and proceeding thus the reverse of tactics, which should begin with small details in order to arrive at the formation and the employment of a great army.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>But in strategy we begin at the top, that is to say, with the plan of campaign.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>We will suppose then the army about to take the field; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> care of its chief will be to settle with the government upon the nature of the <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>war which it shall make; afterwards it will be his duty to study well the theatre of its enterprises; then he will choose, in concert with the chief of the <rs>State</rs>, the most suitable base of operations, according as its frontiers and those of its allies shall favor thereto.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The choice of this base, and still more the end which it shall be proposed to attain, will contribute to determine the zone of operations that will be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>The generalissimo will take a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective point for his enterprises; he will choose the line of operations which would lead to this point, whether as a temporary line, or as a definitive line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The army marching upon this line of operations, will have a front of operations or a strategic front; behind this front it will do well to have a line of defense, to serve as a support in case of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>The transient positions which its <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> will take on the front of operations, or upon the line of defense, will be strategic positions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>When the army shall arrive near its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective point, and the enemy shall commence to oppose its enterprises, it will attack him, or manoeuvre to constrain him to a retreat; it will adopt to this effect <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> strategic lines of manoeuvres, which being temporary, may deviate to a certain point from the general line of operations, with which they must not be confounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>To connect the front of operations with the base, <num value="1">one</num> will form as he advances, his staple line and lines of supply, depots, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>If the line of operations be somewhat lengthened in depth, and there be hostile corps in reach of disturbing it, choice will have to be made between the attack and expulsion of those corps, and the pursuit of the enterprise against the hostile army, paying no attention to them, or merely observing them; if this latter course be resolved upon, there will result from it a double front of operations and great detachments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>The army being near obtaining its objective point, and the enemy wishing to oppose this, there will be a battle ; when this shock shall be indecisive, it will be resolved to recommence the struggle; if a victory be gained, our enterprises will be carried on for attaining or passing beyond the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective point and adopting a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>When the aim of this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective shall be the taking of an important place of arms, the siege will commence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>If the army is not sufficiently numerous for continuing its march, leaving a siege corps behind it, it will take a strategic position for covering it; thus, in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, the army of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, not numbering <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> combattants, was not able to pass <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, in order to penetrate to the heart of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, leaving <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> <pb id="p.78" n="78"/>men before the place, and having besides <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men in front, upon the double line of the <name>Tyrol</name> and the <name>Frioul</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>In the case, on the contrary, where the army should have sufficient forces to obtain greater advantages from its victory, or rather where it should have no siege to make, it would march to a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> objective point more important still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>If this point be found at a certain distance, it will be necessary to procure an intermediate point of support; an eventual base will then be formed by means of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> cities secure from insult, which will doubtless have been occupied; in the contrary case, a small strategic reserve will be formed, which will cover the rear and protect the grand depot by field works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>When the army shall pass considerable rivers, <hi rend="italics">tetes de ponts</hi> will be hastily constructed there, and if the bridges are in cities enclosed by walls, a few intrenchments will be raised to augment the defense of those posts, and to double thus the solidity of the eventual base, or of the strategic reserve which should there be placed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>If, on the contrary, the battle has been lost, there will be a retreat to the end of approaching the base, and of drawing therefrom new forces, as well from the detachments which would be drawn in, as from the places and intrenched camps, which would arrest the enemy or oblige him to divide his means.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>When winter approaches, there will be winter cantonments, or else operations will be continued by that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> armies which, having obtained a decided superiority, and finding no serious obstacles in the hostile line of defense, should wish to profit from its ascendancy; there would then be a winter campaign; this resolution, which, in, all cases, becomes equally painful for both armies, presents no special combinations; unless it be the necessity for a redoubled activity in the enterprises, in order to obtain the most prompt <hi rend="italics">denoument</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Such is the ordinary movement of a war; such will also be that which we shall follow, in order to proceed to the examination of the different combinations which those operations lead to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>All those which embrace the ensemble of the theatre of war, are in the domain of strategy, which will thus comprehend:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/><num value="13">13</num>. Diversions and great detachments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>Independently of those combinations which enter principally in the projection of the general plan for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enterprises of the campaign, there are other mixed operations, which participate of strategy for the direction to be given them, and of tactics for their execution; as the passage of rivers, and streams, retreats, winter quarters, surprises, descents, great convoys, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> branch is tactics, that is to say, the manoeuvres of an army on the field of battle, or of, combat, and the different formations for leading troops to the attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> branch is logistics, (<hi rend="italics">la logistique</hi>) or the practical art of moving armies, the material details of marches and of formations, the situation of non-intrenched camps and cantonments, in a word, the execution of the combinations of strategy and of tactics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>Several futile controversies have had place for determining, in an absolute manner, the line of demarkation which separates those divers branches of the science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>I have said that strategy is the art of making war upon the map, the art of embracing the whole of a theatre of war; tactics is the art of combatting on the ground, of placing thereon <num value="1">one</num>'s forces according to the localities, and of putting them in action on the different points of the field of battle, that is to say, within a space of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> leagues, in such a manner that all the acting corps may receive orders and execute them in the course even of the action; finally, <hi rend="italics">la logistique</hi> is in substance only the science of preparing the application of the other <pb id="p.80" n="80"/><num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>My definition has been criticised without a better <num value="1">one</num> being given; it is certain that many battles have been decided by strategical movements, and have been even but a series of such movements; but that has never been the case except against dispersed armies, which is an exception; now the general definition, being applicable only to pitched battles, is none the less exact.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> 
<p>It may be said that tactics is the combat, and that strategy is all the war before and after the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>sieges alone excepted, even they belong to strategy so far as the deciding upon those necessary to be made, and how they must be covered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Strategy decides where we should act, <hi rend="italics">la logistique</hi> conducts and places the troops there; tactics decides their employment and the mode of execution.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>Thus, independently of the measures of local execution which are within its province, grand tactics, in my view, will comprehend the following objects:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>The essential object of this work is to demonstrate that there excists a fundamental principle of all the operations of war, a principle which <pb id="p.81" n="81"/>ought to preside over all the combinations in order that they be good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>It consists:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/><num value="1">1</num>. In carrying by strategic combinations the mass of the forces of an army successively upon the decisive points of a theatre of war, and as much as possible upon the communications of the enemy, without endangering its own;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/><num value="2">2</num>. In manoeuvering in such a manner as to engage this mass of the forces with fractions only of the hostile army;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/><num value="3">3</num>. In directing equally, on the day of battle, by tactical manoeuvres, the mass of <num value="1">one</num>'s forces upon the decisive point of the field of battle, or upon that of the hostile line which it would be important to overwhelm;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/><num value="4">4</num>. In managing so that those masses be not merely present upon the decisive point, but that they be put in action there with energy and concert, in a manner to produce a simultaneous effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>This <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> has been found so simple that it has not lacked criticisms.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> 
<p>To meet these criticisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>I ought, perhaps, to place here the entire chapter of the general principles of the art of war, which terminates my Treatise on Grand Operations, (chap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/><num value="35">XXXV</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> edition) ; but powerful motives have prevented me from despoiling my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> work of the chapter which makes its principal merit, and which my censors ought at least to read.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>It has been objected that it were very easy to recommend the carrying <num value="1">one</num>'s principal force upon the decisive points, and to know how to engage them thereon; but that the art consists precisely in recognizing these points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Far from contesting so <hi rend="italics">naive</hi> a truth; I own that it would be at least ridiculous to utter a like <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs>, without accompanying it with all the developments necessary for causing its different chances of application to be comprehended; I have, therefore, neglected nothing for putting every studious officer in condition to determine easily the decisive points of a strategical or tactical field (<hi rend="italics">un &eacute;chiquier strategique ou tactique</hi>.) There will be found in article <num value="19">19</num>, the definition of those different points, and there will be recognized in all articles from the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> to the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>, those which apply to the divers combinations of a war. Military men who, after having meditated upon them attentively, should still believe that the determination of those decisive points is an insoluble problem, ought to despair of ever comprehending any thing of strategy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>In fact, a theatre of operations never presents but <num value="3">three</num> zones, <num value="1">one</num> to the right, <num value="1">one</num> to the left, and <num value="1">one</num> at the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>In the same manner each zone, each front of operations, each strategical position and line of <pb id="p.82" n="82"/>defense, as well as each tactical line of battle, has never but those same subdivisions, that is to say, <num value="2">two</num> extremeties and a centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>Now, there will always be <num value="1">one</num> of those <num value="3">three</num> directions which it will be proper to follow, in order to reach the important object desired, <num value="1">one</num> of the other <num value="2">two</num> will be more or less removed from it, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> will be altogether opposed to it. Hence, in combining hostile positions with geographical points, and with the projects which should be formed, it seems that every question of strategic movement, as well as of tactical manoeuvre, would always be reduced to knowing whether we ought to manoeuvre to the right, to the left, or directly to the front; the choice between <num value="3">three</num> alternatives so simple, could not be an enigma worthy of a new sphinx.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>I am far from pretending, nevertheless, that the whole art of war consists merely in the choice of a good direction to be given to masses, but it could not be denied that it is at least the fundamental point of strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>It will be for talent of execution, skill, energy, and <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi>, to complete what good combinations will have been able to propose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>We are about to apply then the principle indicated, to the different combinations of strategy and tactics, then to prove, by the history of <num value="20">twenty</num> celebrated campaigns, that all their successes or reverses were the result of the application, or of the neglect of this principle.<note anchored="yes">

<head>Article <num value="16">XVI</num>: system of offensive of defensive operations.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>War once resolved upon, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be decided, is to know whether it is to be offensive or defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all, it is proper to define well what is understood by these words: <pb id="p.83" n="83"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The offensive presents itself under several aspects; if it be directed against a great State, which it embraces entirely, it is then <hi rend="italics">an invasion;</hi> if it be applied only to the attack of a province, or of a line of defense more or less limited, it is no longer an invasion, but an ordinary offensive; finally, if it be but an attack upon any position whatever of the hostile army, and limited to a single operation, it is called <hi rend="italics">the initiative of movements</hi>. As we have said in the preceding chapter, the offensive considered morally and politically, is almost always advantageous, because it carries the war upon foreign soil, spares your own country, diminishes the resources of the enemy, and augments yours; it elevates the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of the army, and often imposes dread upon the adversary; meanwhile it happens also that it excites his ardor, when it makes him feel that the question is to save his menaced country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Under the military relation, the offensive has its good and its bad side; in strategy, if it be pushed to an invasion, it gives lines of operations <hi rend="italics">lengthened in depth</hi>, which are always dangerous in an enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>All the theatre of operations, the mountains, the rivers, the defiles, the fortifications, being obstacles favorable to the defense, are thus against the offensive; the inhabitants and the authorities of the country will be hostile to it, instead of being instruments in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>But if it obtain a success, it strikes the hostile power to the heart, deprives it of the means of war, and may bring about a prompt <hi rend="italics">denoument</hi> to the struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Applied to a mere transient operation, that is to say, considered as the initiative of movements, the offensive is always advantageous, especially in strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>In fact, if the art of war consist in directing <num value="1">one</num>'s forces upon the decisive point, it is comprehended that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> means of applying this principle will be to take the initiative of movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>He who has taken this initiative knows beforehand what he is doing and what he wishes; he arrives with his masses at the point where it is convenient for him to strike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>He who waits is anticipated every where; the enemy falls upon fractions of his army; he neither knows where his adversary means to direct his efforts, nor the means which he ought to oppose to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>In tactics, the offensive has also its advantages; but they are less positive, because the operations not being upon so large a sphere, he who has the initiative cannot conceal them from the enemy, who, discovering this instantly, can, by the aid of good reserves, remedy it upon the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Besides that, he who marches upon the enemy has against him all the disadvantages resulting from the obstacles of the ground which he will be obliged to overcome in order to approach the line of his adversary, which leads to the belief, that in tactics especially, the chances of the <num value="2">two</num> systems <pb id="p.84" n="84"/>are pretty nearly balanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>For the rest, whatever advantages could be expected from the offensive strategically and politically, it is obvious that this system could not be adopted exclusively for a whole war, for it is not even certain that a campaign commenced offensively may not finish with the defensive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Defensive war, as we have already said, has also its advantages when it is wisely combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>It is of <num value="2">two</num> kinds: the inert or passive defense, and the active defense with offensive returns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is always pernicious; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> may procure great success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The aim of a defensive war being to cover, as long as possible, the portion of the territory menaced by the enemy, it is evident that all the operations should have for object the retarding of his progress, the thwarting of his enterprises, by multiplying the difficulties of his march, without, meanwhile, allowing the army to be seriously broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>He who decides upon invasion, does it always in consequence of any ascendancy whatever, he should aim then at as prompt a <hi rend="italics">denoument</hi> as possible; the defender, on the contrary, ought to put it off until his adversary is weakened by detachments, marches, fatigues, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>An army is scarcely reduced to a positive defense but in consequence of reverses or a notable inferiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>In this case it seeks, by the support of its places, and by favor of natural or artificial barriers, the means of re-establishing the equilibrium of chances, by multiplying the obstacles which it can oppose to the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>This sytem, when it is not pushed too far, presents also happy chances but it is in the case only when the general who believes himself compelled to resort to it, has the good sense not to be reduced to an inert defense; that is to say, when he shall take care not to await passively, in fixed posts, all the blows which the enemy should be pleased to deliver him. He must apply himself on the contrary, to redouble the activity of his operations, and to seize every occasion which presents, of falling upon the feeble points of the enemy, by taking the initiative of movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>This kind of warfare, which I have heretofore named the offensive-defensive,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/> 
<p>Others have named it the active defensive, which is not correct, since the defense could be very active without being offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>We may, nevertheless, adopt the term, which is more grammatical.</p></note> may be advantageous in strategy as well as in tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>In acting thus, you have the advantages of the <num value="2">two</num> systems, for you have that of the initiative, and you are better able to seize the moment when it is suitable to strike, when you find yourself in the midst of a theatre which has been prepared beforehand, at the centre of the resources and supports of your country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>The theatre of a war embraces all the countries in which <num value="2">two</num> powers may attack, whether by their own territory, or by that of their allies, or of the secondary powers which they will draw into the vortex through fear or through interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>When a war is complicated with maritime operations, then its theatre is not restrained to the frontiers of a State, but may embrace the <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres, as has happened in the struggles between <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, from <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName> down to our day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Thus, the general theatre of a war is a thing so vague, and so dependent upon incidents, that it must not be confounded with the theatre of operations which each army may embrace, independently of all complications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>The theatre of a continental war between <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, may embrace <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> alone, or <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, if the <name>German</name> princes take part in it. <pb id="p.86" n="86"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>It may happen that the operations are combined, or that each army is destined to act separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, the general theatre of opertions ought to be considered only as the same <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>, upon which strategy should cause the armies to move with the common object which shall have been resolved upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> case, each army will have its special theatre of operations, independent of the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>The theatre of operations of an army comprehends all the ground which it should seek to invade, as well as that which it may have to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>If it is to operate by itself, this theatre forms its whole <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>, out of which it might indeed seek an issue in the case where it should find itself invested therein on <num value="3">three</num> sides, but out of which it ought never to combine any manoeuvre, since nothing would be provided for a common action with the secondary army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>If, on the contrary, the operations are concerted, then the theatre of operations of each army, taken separately, becomes, in some sort, but <num value="1">one</num> of the zones of operations of the <hi rend="italics">general &eacute;chiquier</hi> where the belligerents are to operate with the same object.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Independently of the topographical accidents with which it is strewn, each theatre or <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>, which is to be operated upon by <num value="1">one</num> or several armies, is composed for both parties:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/><num value="1">1</num>. Of a fixed base (or basis) of operations;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/><num value="2">2</num>. Of an objective aim;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/><num value="3">3</num>. Of fronts of operations and lines of defense;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/><num value="5">5</num>. Of strategic lines and lines of communications;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/><num value="6">6</num>. Of natural or artificial obstacles to conquer or to oppose to the enemy;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/><num value="7">7</num>. Of important geographical strategic points to occupy in the offensive, or to cover defensively;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/><num value="8">8</num>. Of accidental bases of operations intermediate between the objective aim and the positive base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/><num value="9">9</num>. Of points of refuge in case of reverses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>To render the demonstration more intelligible, I will suppose <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, wishing to invade <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> armies, destined to be united under <num value="1">one</num> chief, and departing from Mayence, from the <rs>Upper Rhine</rs>, from <placeName reg="Cluses, Haute-Savoie, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7009045">Savoy</placeName>, or from the maritime <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>Each country, which <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these armies would have to pass over, will be, in some sort, a zone of operations of the <hi rend="italics">general &eacute;chiquier</hi>. But if the army of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> is to act <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>only as far as the <name>Adige</name>, without concerting any thing with the army of the <rs>Rhine</rs>, then what was considered only as a zone of operations in the general plan, becomes the sole <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> of that army and its theatre of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>Hence each <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> should have its special base, its objective point, its zones and lines of operations Which lead from the base to the objective aim in the offensive, or from the objective aim to the base in the defensive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>With regard to the material or topographical points, with which a theatre of operations is found more or less furrowed in every direction, the art is not wanting in works which have discussed their different strategical or tactical properties; the routes, the rivers, the mountains, the forests, the cities offering resources, or secure from a <hi rend="italics">coup de main</hi>, the strong holds, have been the object of many debates, in which the most erudite have not always been the most luminous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>Some have given to names strange significations; it has been published and taught, that rivers were lines of operations <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>! Now, as such a line could not exist without having <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> roads for moving the army within the sphere of its enterprises, and at least <num value="1">one</num> line of retreat, those modern Moseses pretended thus to transform rivers into lines of retreat, and even into lines of manoeuvre!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>It would appear much more natural and correct to say that rivers are excellent lines of supply, powerful auxiliaries for the establishment of a good line of operations, but are never this line itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>It is not with less astonishment that we have seen it affirmed by a grave writer, that, <hi rend="italics">if a country were to be created to make of it a good theatre of war, it would be necessary to avoid constructing converging routes therein, because they facilitate invasion</hi>! As if a country could exist without a capital, without rich and industrious cities, and as if the routes did not per force converge towards those points where the interests of a whole country are naturally and irresistably concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Even though a steppe were made of all <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, in order to reconstruct in it a theatre of war to the liking of the author, commercial cities would rise again, chief towns would be re-established, and all the roads would converge anew towards those vivificating arteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>Besides, did not the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00087.00229" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> owe to these converging routes the facility with which he beat <persName n="Jourdan,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00087.00230" reg="mostcommon:Jourdan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jourdan</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>And, in fact, do not those routes favor the defense as much as the attack, since <num value="2">two</num> masses, falling back on <num value="2">two</num> converging rays, can unite quicker than the <num value="2">two</num> masses which should follow, and thus beat them separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/><pb id="p.88" n="88"/></p> 
<p>Other authors have insisted that mountainous countries are full of strategic points, and the antagonists of this opinion have affirmed that strategical points were, on the contrary, more rare in the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> than in the plains, but that, on the other hand, if they were less numerous, they were for that reason all the more important and decisive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>Some writers have presented also high mountains as so many Chinese Walls, inaccessible for every thing; whereas, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00088.00231" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, in speaking of the <name>Rhetian</name> <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, said, <quote><hi rend="italics">that an army ought to pass wherever a man could plant his foot</hi>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/><rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, experienced also in mountain warfare, have acknowledged, in the same manner, the great difficulty of conducting therein a defensive war, except by uniting the advantages of a rising in mass of the populations to those of a reuglar army, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for guarding the summits and harrassing the enemy, the latter for delivering him battle upon the decisive points at the junction of the great valleys.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>In animadverting upon these contradictions, we do not yield to a futile spirit of criticism, but merely to the desire of demonstrating to our readers that, far from having carried the art to its utmost limits, there still exist a multitude of points to discuss:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point in a plan of operations is to be assured of a good base; this name is applied to the extent of the frontiers of a State from whence <pb id="p.89" n="89"/>an army will draw its resources and reinforcements; that from whence it will have to depart for an offensive expedition, and where it will find a refuge in time of need; that, in fine, upon which it will have to support itself, if it covers its country defensively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>In this last case, the line of the frontiers will become the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of defense, and the army will then have to provide itself with a base in <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, either in the direction of the centre of the <rs>State</rs>, or in a direction nearly parallel to the frontier, according to what will be explained in article <num value="38">38</num>, upon so styled excentric retreats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Although the base of operations is also ordinarily that of resources, meanwhile, every line by which a part of those resources should come, vould not for that be a line of operations, but a line of supply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>Each army may have several successive bases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>A French army operating in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, has for a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> base the <rs>Rhine</rs>; but if it be withdrawn behind that river, it has a new base upon the <rs>Moselle</rs>; it may have <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> upon Seine, and a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> upon the <name>Loire</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>When an army is repulsed upon its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> base, this becomes then a line of defense, especially if it be fortified; in this case, the army must have a new base in <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>A base, supported upon a large and impetuous river, the banks of which should be held by good fortresses, situated in command of this river, would be, without contradiction, the most favorable that could be desired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>The larger the base, the less easy it is to cover, but the less easy will it be also to cut off the army from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>A State, the capital or centre of power of which, is too near the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> frontier, offers less advantages for basing its defenders, than a State whose capital is more removed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>Every base, to be perfect, should offer <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> places, of a capacity sufficient for establishing thereon magazines, depots, &amp;c. It should have at least <num value="1">one</num> intrenched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/><hi rend="italics">tete de pont</hi>, upon each of the unfordable rivers found upon it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Until now, there has generally been sufficient accord upon all the requisites we have just enumerated; but there are other points upon which opinions have been more divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>Several writers have insisted that, to be perfect, a base should be parallel with that of the adversary; whereas, on the contrary, I have uttered the opinion that bases, perpendicular to those of the enemy, are the most advantageous, particularly those which, presenting <num value="2">two</num> faces nearly perpendicular, the <num value="1">one</num> to the other, and forming a reentrant angle, would assure a double base at need, <pb id="p.90" n="90"/>would control <num value="2">two</num> sides of the strategic field (<hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier strategique</hi>,) would procure <num value="2">two</num> lines of retreat very distant from each other, and finally, would facilitate every change of the line of operations which the unexpected turn of the chances of war could render necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>I demonstrated nearly <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, in my treatise on grand military operations, the influence which the direction of frontiers ought to exercise upon that of the base and of the lines of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>It is recollected that, in applying those truths to the different theatres of war, I compared the latter to an <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>, bounded on <num value="1">one</num> side or the other by a sea, or by a great neutral power, which would form equally an insurmountable obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>See how I expressed myself: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/></p> 
<p>The general configuration of the theatre of war may have also a great influence upon the direction to be given to lines of operations, (and consequently to the bases.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>In fact, if the whole theatre of war form a field, or figure, presenting <num value="4">four</num> faces, more or less regular, it may happen that <num value="1">one</num> of the armies, at the commencement of the campaign, occupies a single <num value="1">one</num> of those faces, as it is possible that it may hold <num value="2">two</num> of them, whilst the enemy should occupy but <num value="1">one</num> only, and that the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> should form an insurmountable obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>The manner in which this theatre of war would be embraced, would present then very different combinations in each of those hypotheses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>In order better to make this comprehended, I will cite the theatre of war of the <rs>French</rs> armies in <placeName key="tgn,7012772" n="1.000 1" reg="rhine-westphalia">Westphalia</placeName>, from <dateStruct value="1757--"><year reg="1757">1757</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1762--"><year reg="1762">1762</year></dateStruct>, and that of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00090.00232" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>.</p></quote> (See Fig. <num value="1">1</num>.) <figure id="fig.090"> 
<head>Figure I.</head></figure> <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/></p> 
<p>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these theatres of war, the side <rs>Ab</rs> was formed by the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>, the side <rs>Bd</rs> by the line of the <name>Weser</name>, base of the army of the <rs>Duke Ferdinand</rs>; the line of the <rs>Main</rs> formed the side <rs>Cd</rs>, base of the <rs>French</rs> army, and the face <rs>Ac</rs> was formed by the line of the <rs>Rhine</rs>, equally guarded by the armies of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="15">XV</genName></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>It is seen, then, that the <rs>French</rs> armies, operating offensively, and holding <num value="2">two</num> faces, had in their favor the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>, forming the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> side, and that consequently they had only to gain the side <rs>Bd</rs> by manoeuvres, in order to be masters of the <num value="4">four</num> faces, that is to say, the base and all the communications of the enemy, as the above figure shows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>The French Army E, departing from the base <rs>Cd</rs>, to gain the front of operations Fgh, cut off the allied Army J, from the side <rs>Bd</rs>, which formed its base; this latter would then have been thrown back upon the angle L, A, M, formed near <placeName key="tgn,7005300" n="1.000 2" reg="emden,weser-ems,niedersachsen,deutschland,europe">Emden</placeName>, by the lines of the <rs>Rhine</rs>, the <name>Ems</name> and the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>; whilst the <rs>French</rs> army, E, could always communicate with its bases of the <rs>Main</rs> and <rs>Rhine</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The manoeuvre of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00091.00233" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> upon the <name>Saale</name> in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>, was combined absolutely in the same manner; he occupied at <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> and at <placeName reg="Naumburg, Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt" key="tgn,7012847">Naumburg</placeName> the line <rs>Fgh</rs>, and marched afterwards by <persName n="Halle,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00091.00234" reg="mostcommon:Halle,nomatch:0"><surname>Halle</surname></persName> and Dessau, in order to throw back the <rs>Prussian Army</rs> J, upon the side <rs>Ab</rs>, formed by the sea. The result is sufficiently well known.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>The great art of directing properly <num value="1">one</num>'s lines of operations consists then in combining his marches in such a manner as to seize the hostile communication, without losing his own; it is easily seen that the line <rs>Fgh</rs>, in consequence of its prolonged position, and the crotchet left upon the extremity of the enemy, preserves always <num value="1">one</num>'s communications with the base <rs>Cd</rs>; it is.the exact application of the manoeuvres at <placeName key="tgn,2035190;tgn,2028962" n="0.014 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2035190;marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.011 000000.0992	placename;tgn,2028962;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America" reg="marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America">Marengo</placeName>, <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00091.00235" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>When the theatre of war shall not be adjacent to the sea, it will always be limited by a great neutral power, which will guard its frontiers and close <num value="1">one</num> of the sides of the square; doubtless it will not be a barrier as insurmountable as the sea; but, in general thesis it can always be considered an obstacle upon which it would be dangerous to fall back after a defeat, and advantageous for the same reason to crowd an enemy upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The territory of a power which should have a <num value="150">hundred and fifty</num> or <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men, is not violated with impunity, and if a beaten army took this course, it would be none the less cut off from its base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>If it were a small power which limited the theatre of war, it is probable <pb id="p.92" n="92"/>that it would soon be united with it, and the face of the square would be found merely a little more retired, to the frontiers of a great power or to a sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>To be assured of the correctness of these ideas, it is sufficient to cast an eye over the theatre of the campaign of <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The <placeName reg="Baltic Sea" key="tgn,7013200">Baltic Sea</placeName>, and the frontiers of Austrian Gallicia, formed the <num value="2">two</num> faces Ab and Cd of the square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>I think that it was very important to both the parties, not to allow themselves, to be thrown upon either of those obstacles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>The configuration of the frontiers will sometimes modify the form of the faces of the square, or, more correctly speaking, the faces of the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>. It may have the form of a trapezoid, as in the following figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/><figure id="fig.092"> 
<head>Figure <num value="2">II</num>.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>In this latter case, the <rs>Army Gh</rs>, which should be master of the faces <rs>Ac</rs> and <rs>Cd</rs>, would have still greater advantages, since the base of its adversary narrowing towards Bd, the latter would have many more difficulties in regaining his communications; the front of this base offering less development, would present also less resources for manoeuvering, and it would give, on the contrary, to the <rs>Army Gh</rs>, the means of operating with more success, since the direction of its line Cd, would naturally lead it upon the communications of its adversary, and the space which it would have to occupy, in order to cut them off, would be less extended, consequently more easy to take up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>The theatre of war in <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Polska" key="tgn,7006366">Poland</placeName>, of which we have just <pb id="p.93" n="93"/>spoken, was actually similar to this, for the frontiers of Gallicia, prolonged to the <name>Narew</name>, formed, with the line of the <name>Vistula</name>, the contracted side Bd. The manner in which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00093.00236" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> manoeuvred before the battle of <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>, was absolutely the same as that which is found traced; a fortuitous incident prevented him from obtaining from it all the success which he expected, but his manoeuvre was none the less wise for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Meanwhile, this operation offered also its unfavorable chances, because of political antecedents; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was founded upon the small confidence which could be accorded to the <name>Austrian</name> neutrality; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> upon the great remoteness of the base of the <rs>French</rs> army which put its communications with the <rs>Elbe</rs> at the mercy of the cabinet of <placeName reg="Wien, Wien, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003321">Vienna</placeName>; it depended only upon the latter, from this epoch, to put an end to those immoderate invasions; the manoeuvre of the <rs>French</rs> general might be strategically good, whilst the operations of the statesman was nothing else than audacious.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>The base in Bohemia in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, proves, as well as all that precedes, in favor of my opinion; for it was by the perpendicular direction of that base to that of the <rs>French</rs> army, that the <name>Allies</name> succeeded in paralyzing the immense advantages which the line of the <rs>Elbe</rs> would, but for that, have procured for <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00093.00237" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>; a circumstance which made all the chances of the campaign turn in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>In the same manner, in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, it was, by basing themselves perpendicularly upon the <name>Oka</name> and Kalouga, that the <name>Russians</name> were able to execute their flank march upon Wiazma and <placeName key="tgn,7010181" n="1.000 10" reg="Krasnoi,lost and found/Moldova,Moldova,Europe">Krasnoi</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Moreover, to be convinced of this, it is sufficient to reflect, that the front of operations of an army, the base of which should be perpendicular to that of the enemy, would be found established parallelly to the line of operations of its adversaries, and that it would thus become very easy to operate upon their communications and their line of retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>I have already said that perpendicular bases would be especially favorable when they should present a double frontier, as will be seen in the above-mentioned figures; now, the critics will not fail to object that this does not accord with what I have said in favor of frontiers salient to the side of the enemy, and against double lines of operations with an equality of forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>The objection would be more specious than just, for the greatest advantage of a perpendicular base results precisely in that it forms a salient which takes in reverse a part of the theatre of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>Again, the possession of a base with <num value="2">two</num> faces by no means implies the necessity of occupying both in force; it suffices on the contrary, to have upon <num value="1">one</num> of then a few fortified points, with a small corps of observation, whilst the <pb id="p.94" n="94"/>weight of <num value="1">one</num>'s forces would be carried on the other face, as had place in the campaigns of <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>The nearly right angle, formed by the <rs>Rhine</rs>, from <persName><foreName>Constance</foreName></persName> to <placeName key="tgn,7007269" n="1.000 1" reg="basel,basel-stadt,schweiz,europe">Basle</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName key="tgn,1039835" n="1.000 10" reg="Kehl,Freiburg,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Kehl</placeName>, offered to <persName n="Moreau,General,,,," id="n0051.0005.00094.00238" reg="mostcommon:Moreau,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Moreau</surname></persName> <num value="1">one</num> base parallel, and another perpendicular to that of his antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>He pushed <num value="2">two</num> divisions by his left upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of those bases, towards <placeName key="tgn,1039835" n="1.000 10" reg="Kehl,Freiburg,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Kehl</placeName>, in order to draw the attention of the enemy in that direction, whilst he filed with <num value="9">nine</num> divisions upon the extremity of the perpendicular face to the side of <placeName key="tgn,7007462" n="1.000 2" reg="schaffhausen,schaffhausen,schweiz,europe">Schaffhausen</placeName>, which brought him, in a few marches, to the gates of <placeName key="tgn,7004324" n="1.000 1" reg="augsburg,schwaben,bayern,deutschland,europe">Augsburg</placeName>, after the <num value="2">two</num> detached divisions had already rejoined him.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>Here are, I trust, sufficient proofs to demonstrate the necessity of suspecting somewhat, that strategy, which is treated too geometrically, and to convince <num value="1">one</num> that if this science has made great progress, it can still be improved by modifying the <hi rend="italics">geometrical systems</hi>, by those founded upon the principles and the experience of war, which counsel a slight deviation from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Another not less important question, as to the best direction to be given to bases of operations, is that which has respect to bases established upon the sea shore, and which has also given rise to grave errors; for, as favorable as they are for some, equally formidable would they be for others, as may be seen from all that precedes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>After having pointed out the danger there would be for a continental army to be thrown back upon the sea, it should appear astonishing that any <num value="1">one</num> could have vaunted the advantages of bases established upon its shores, and that they could suit any but an insular army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>In fact, <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00094.00241" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, coming with this fleet to the succor of <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, could adopt no better base than that of <placeName reg="Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,7010978">Lisbon</placeName>, or, more properly speaking, the <hi rend="italics">presqu&lsquo; &icirc;le</hi> of <persName n="Torres,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00094.00242" reg="mostcommon:Torres,nomatch:0"><surname>Torres</surname></persName>-Vedras, which covers the only avenues to that capital on the land side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Here the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7016546" n="1.000 2" reg="tagus,europe">Tagus</placeName>, and those of the sea, covered not only his <num value="2">two</num> flanks, but they yet assured his line of retreat, which could have place only upon his vessels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Seduced by the advantages which this famous intrenched <placeName reg="camp of Torres-Vedras">camp of Torres-Vedras</placeName> had procured the <rs>English</rs> general, and only judging from effects, without going back to causes, many generals, very learned in other <pb id="p.95" n="95"/>respects, would no longer acknowledge as good bases, any but those which, situated on the sea shore, would procure the army easy supplies, and places of refuge, with flanks secure from insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>This blindness was pushed to such a degree, that <persName n="Pfuhl,General,,,," id="n0051.0005.00095.00243" reg="mostcommon:Pfuhl,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pfuhl</surname></persName> sustained, in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, that the natural base of the <name>Russians</name> was at <placeName reg="Riga, Irkutskaya Oblast', Rossiya" key="tgn,7010267">Riga</placeName>, a strategical blasphemy, which was also uttered in my presence, by <num value="1">one</num> of the most renowned of the <rs>French</rs> generals.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>Forgetting that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rule of all bases of a continental army, is that they rest upon the front the most opposite to the sea; that is to say, upon that which would place the army at the centre of all the elements of its military power, and if its population, from which it would be found separated and, cut off, if it committed the grave fault of resting upon the sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>An insular power, acting upon the continent, ought naturally to make the diametrically opposite calculation, to the end, nevertheless, of applying the same axiom, which prescribes to each, <hi rend="italics">to seek his base upon the points where he can be sustained by all his means of war, and find, at the same time, a certain refuge</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>A power, strong both upon sea and land, and whose numerous squadrons command a sea adjacent to the theatre of operations, might, indeed, be able still to base a small army of <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men upon its shore, by assuring it a well protected refuge, and supplies of every kind; but to give such a base to continental masses of a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num> men, engaged with forces disciplined and nearly equal in numbers, would ever be an act of folly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Meanwhile as every maxim has its exceptions, there is a case in which it might be proper to deviate from what we have just said, and to carry ones operations to the sea side; it is when we should have to do with an adversary little to be dreaded in the field, and when being decided masters of that sea, we could supply ourselves easily from that quarter, whilst it would be difficult to do so in the interior of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Although it is very rare to see those <num value="3">three</num> conditions united, it was, nevertheless, what happened in the war with <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Besides the permanent bases, which are ordinarily found established on <num value="1">one</num>'s own frontiers, or at least in the country of an ally that can be counted upon, there are also eventual or temporary ones, which depend upon operations undertaken in a hostile country; but as these are rather transient points of support we shall say a few words of them in a special article, to the end of avoiding the confusion which might result from a similitude of denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>(See article <num value="23">23</num>.) <milestone unit="hr"/> </p></div2>

<head>Article <num value="19">XIX</num>: strategical points and lines, decisive points of a theatre of war, and objectives of operations.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>There are strategic points and lines of divers natures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>Some receive this name from the fact alone of their situation, from which results all their importance on the field of operations; they are then permanent geographical strategic points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>Others acquire their value from the relations which they have with the position of the hostile forces, and with the enterprises which it should be designed to form against them; <hi rend="italics">these, then, are strategic points of manoeuvre</hi>, and altogether eventual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Finally, there are strategic points and lines which have but a secondary importance, and others the importance of which is at once immense and incessant; these last I have named <hi rend="italics">decisive strategic points</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>I am about to endeavor to explain those relations as clearly as I myself conceive them, which is not always so easy as is believed in such matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/><pb id="p.97" n="97"/></p> 
<p>Every point of the theatre of war which should lave a military importance, either from its situation at the centre of communications, or from military establishments and fortified works of whatever description, which would have an influence over the strategic field, will be, in reality a territorial or geographical strategic point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>An illustrious general affirms, on the contract, that every point which might unite the above-mentioned conditions, would not be for that a strategic point, if it were not found in a suitable direction relatively to the operations which should be had in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>If shall be pardoned for declaring a different opinion, for a strategical point is always such from its nature, and that on even which should be the farthest removed from the theatre of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enterprises, could be drawn into it by the unxpected turn of events, and thus acquire all the importance of which it Would be susceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>It had been more exact then, in my opinion, to say that all strategic points were not decisive points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>Strategic lines are equally either geographical or relative only to temporary manoeuvres; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> may be subdivided into <num value="2">two</num> classes, namely, the geographical lines which from their permanent importance, belong to the decisive points of the theatre of war,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/> 
<p>I shall be reproached yet, perhaps, for a barbarism, because I give the name decisive or objective point to lines, and that a point could not be a line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>It is useless to observe to my readers, that objective points are not geometrical points but a grammatical formula, expressing the object which an army proposes to itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>And if the word <hi rend="italics">decisive</hi> be objected to, seeing that a point by itself is rarely decisive, the word <hi rend="italics">important</hi>, may be substituted for it. although it does not express so strongly the idea which I attach to it.</p></note> and those which have value only because they connect <num value="2">two</num> strategical points together.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>For fear of confounding these different subjects, we shall treat separately of the strategic lines which relate to a combined manoeuvre, in order to limit ourselves here to what concerns <hi rend="italics">the decisive and objective points</hi> of the zone of operations upon which the enterprises will be directed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>Although there exist intimate relations between these <num value="2">two</num> kinds of points, seeing that every objective must necessarily be <num value="1">one</num> of the decisive points of the theatre of war, there is, meanwhile, a distinction to be made, for all decisive points could not be at the same time the objective aim of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Let us occupy ourselves, then, in the first place, in defining he former, which will conduct more easily to the good choice of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>If think the name <hi rend="italics">decisive strategic point</hi>, may be given to all those <pb id="p.98" n="98"/>which are susceptible of exercising a notable influence, whether upon the whole of the campaign, or upon a single enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>All points, the geographical situation and artificial advantages of which would favor the attack or defense of a front of operations, or of a line of defense, are of this number, and the great well situated places of arms hold the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rank among them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>The decisive points of a theatre of war are then of several kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> are the geographical points, or lines, the importance of which is permanent, and is derived from the configuration even of the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquzer</hi>. Let us take, for example, the theatre of war of the <rs>French</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>; it is quite plain that the <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> parties which shall be master of the course of the <name>Meuse</name>, will be master of the country; for its adversary, outflanked and shut up between the <name>Meuse</name> and the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>, could not receive battle parallelly to this sea, without running the risk of a total loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>In the same manner, the <rs type="place">valley of the Danube</rs> presents a series of important points, which have caused it to be regarded as the key to <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Southern Germany</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Geographical decisive points are also those which would control the junction of several valleys, and the centre of the great communications which intersect a country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>For example, <persName n="Lyons,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00098.00246" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyons</surname></persName> is an important strategic point, because it commands the <num value="2">two</num> valleys of the <name>Rhone</name> and the <name>Saone</name>, and is found at the centre of the communications of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> with <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and of the south with the east; but it would be decisive only so far as there should be found there a strong place, or intrenched camp with <hi rend="italics">tetes de ponts</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/><placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName> is incontestably a strategic point, because it is found at the junction of all the communications of the north of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>If this city were fortified, and situated on the <num value="2">two</num> banks of a large river, it would be almost the key of the country, (if a country has a key, and this figurative expression means any thing else than a decisive point.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>All capitals, being at the centre of the routes of a country, would thus be decisive strategic points, not only for that reason, but through other motives which add to this importance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Besides those points, there exist, in mountainous countries, defiles which are the only practicable issues for an army; these geographical points may be decisive in an enterprise upon the country; it is known what importance the defile of Bard, covered by a little fort, had in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> kind of decisive points is that of eventual points of monoeuvre, which are relative, and result from the situation of the troops of the <pb id="p.99" n="99"/><num value="2">two</num> parties; for example, <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00247" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName>, being found concentrated in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, near <placeName reg="Ulm">Ulm</placeName>, and awaiting the <rs>Russian</rs> army by <placeName reg="Morava" key="tgn,7006467">Moravia</placeName>, the decisive point for attacking him was Donauwerth, or the <rs>Lower-Lech</rs>, for, in gaining it before him, <num value="1">one</num> cut off his line of retreat upon <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, and upon the army destined to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> him. On the contrary, in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Kray,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00248" reg="mostcommon:Kray,nomatch:0"><surname>Kray</surname></persName>, finding himself in the same position at <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00249" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, did not wait for the concurrence of any army from the side of Bohemia, but rather from the <name>Tyrol</name> and the victorious <orgName>army of <persName n="Melas,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00250" reg="mostcommon:Melas,nomatch:0"><surname>Melas</surname></persName></orgName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>; hence the decisive point for attacking him was no longer Donauwerth, but the side opposite in preference, that is to say, by <placeName key="tgn,7007462" n="1.000 2" reg="schaffhausen,schaffhausen,schweiz,europe">Schaffhausen</placeName>, since it was the means of taking in reverse his front of operations, of cutting off his retreat, and of isolating him from the secondary army, as well as from his base, by throwing him back upon the <rs>Maine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>In the same campaign of <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective point of <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00251" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, was to fall upon the right of <persName n="Melas,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00252" reg="mostcommon:Melas,nomatch:0"><surname>Melas</surname></persName> by the <rs>St. Bernard</rs>, in order to seize his communications; it is judged that the <rs>St. Bernard</rs> and <rs>Aosta</rs> were not decisive geographical points, but rather those of manoeuvre, since their importance depended upon the march of <persName n="Melas,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00099.00253" reg="mostcommon:Melas,nomatch:0"><surname>Melas</surname></persName> on Nice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>It may be laid down as a <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs>, that the decisive points of manoeuvre, are upon that <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities of the enemy from whence he could be the more easily separated from his base and from his secondary armies, without exposing <num value="1">one</num>'s self to running the same risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>The extremity opposite to the sea ought always to be preferred, because it is as advantageous to drive the enemy upon the sea, as it is dangerous to expose yourself to a like chance; unless you have to do with an insular and inferior army, in which case you may seek to cut it off from its vessels.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>If the hostile army be scattered, or extended over a very long line, then the decisive point will be the centre; for, by penetrating there, the division of the hostile forces will be augmented, that is to say, their weakness will be doubled, and these troops overwhelmed in detail, will doubtless be ruined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>The decisive point of a field of battle is determined:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/><num value="1">1</num>. From the configuration of the ground;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/><num value="2">2</num>. From the combination of the localities with the strategic aim of an army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/><num value="3">3</num>. From the positions of the respective forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>But, in order not to anticipate the combinations of tactics, we shall treat of those points in the chapter on battles. </p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.3.23" type="section" n="c.3.23"> <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> 
<head>Objective points.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>It is with these points as with the preceding, that is to say, there are objective points of manoeuvre, and others which are geographical, such as an important fortress, the line of a river, a front of operations which would offer good lines of defense, or good points of support for ulteroar enterprises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>In strategy, the object of a campaign determines the objective point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>If this object be offensive, the point will be the occupation of the hostile capital, or that of a military province, the loss of which could determine the enemy to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>In a war of invasion, the capital is ordinarily the objective point which the assailant proposes to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>However, the geographical situation of that capital, the political relations of the belligerent powers with neighboring powers, their reciprocal resources, whether positive or federative, form as many combinations, foreign in reality to the science of combat, but very intimately connected, nevertheless, with plans of operations, and which may decide whether an army should desire or fear to push to the hostile capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>In default of this capital, the objective point will be any front of operations whatever, which should serve as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> base to the enemy, and where should be found certain important places, the possession of which would secure to the army that of the territory occupied; for example, in a war against <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, if <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective would be to attain the line of the <name>Ticino</name> and of the <rs>Po</rs>; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> objective would be <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName> and the line of the <name>Adige</name>; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> would be the <name>Noric</name> <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>In the defensive, the objective point, instead of being that which we should wish to conquer, would be that which we should seek to cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>The capital being looked upon as the focus of a power, becomes the principal objective point in the defensive; but there may be points nearer, as, for example, the defense of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> front and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> base of operations; thus, a French army, being reduced to the defensive behind the <rs>Rhine</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>will have for a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objective point the preventing the passage of the river; it will seek to succor the places of Alsace, if the enemy succeed in effecting his passage and in besieging them; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> objective will be to cover the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> base of operations, which shall be found on the <name>Meuse</name>, or the <rs>Moselle</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>With regard to objective points of <hi rend="italics">manoeuvre</hi>, their whole importance <pb id="p.101" n="101"/>will be judged by what we have already said above of decisive points of the same kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>It is, in some sort, in the good choice of those points of manoeuvre, that consists the most valuable talent of a general, and the surest pledge of great successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>It is certain, at least, that it was the the most incontestable merit of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00101.00254" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>Rejecting the old routine, which looked only to the capture of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places, or to the occupation of a petty adjacent province, he appeared convinced that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> means of doing great things, was to strive, above all, to dislocate and to ruin the hostile army; certain that States and provinces fall of themselves, when they have no longer organized forces for covering them.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/> 
<p>The war in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and all national wars, may be cited as exceptions; meanwhile, without the succor of an organized army, either foreign or national, every partial struggle of populations will succumb in the long run.</p></note> To measure, with a sure <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi>, the chances which the different zones of a theatre of war would offer; to direct your masses concentrically upon that <num value="1">one</num> of your zones which should evidently be the most advantageous; to neglect nothing for instructing yourself as to the approximate position of the hostile masses; then to burst, with the rapidity of lightning, upon the centre of this army, if it be divided, or upon that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> extremities which should conduct the most directly upon its communications, to outflank it, to cut it off, to break it up, to pursue it to the utmost, forcing it in divergent directions; finally, quitting it only after having annihilated or dispersed it &mdash; this is what all the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaigns of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00101.00255" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> indicate as <num value="1">one</num> of the best systems, or at least, as the basis of that which he preferred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>Applied later to the immense distances, and to the inhospitable countries of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 6" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, those manoeuvres had not, in truth, the same success as in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>; however, it must be acknowledged, that if this kind of warfare is not suited to all capacities, nor to all countries, nor to all circumstances, its chances are none the less vast, and are really founded on the application of principles; the excessive abuse which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00101.00256" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> made of this system, could not destroy the real advantages which might be expected from it, when <num value="1">one</num> knows how to impose a limit to his successes, and to put his enterprises in harmony with the respective condition of the armies and the nations adjacent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>The maxims which could be given upon these important strategical operations, are almost wholly contained in what we have just said upon decisive points, and in what we shall explain further on, in speaking of the choice of lines of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>(Art. <num value="21">21</num>.)</p> 
<p>As for what concerns the choice of objective points of manoeuvre, all will depend ordinarily upon the object of the war, upon the character <pb id="p.102" n="102"/>which circumstances or the will of cabinets should impress upon it; finally, upon the reciprocal means of war. In many instances, objective points will be principally geographical, for there will then be had in view only the taking of a few cities, or the obtaining the evacuation of petty adjacent provinces; in others it will be, as with <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00102.00257" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, the destruction of the hostile army that must be aimed at. The manoeuvres at <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00102.00258" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> could not be advised to an army which should march merely to besiege <persName n="Antwerp,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00102.00259" reg="mostcommon:Antwerp,nomatch:0"><surname>Antwerp</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>For far different motives it would not have been prudent, to counsel them to the <rs>French</rs> army beyond the <name>Niemen</name>, <num value="500">five hundred</num> leagues from its frontiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>There is yet a particular kind of objective points which could not be passed over in silence; they are those which, having for object any military point whatever, relate, nevertheless, to the combinations of policy, much more than to those of strategy; in coalitions, especially, it is rare that they do not play a very great part, by the influence they have upon the operations and combinations of cabinets; they might be named then, <hi rend="italics">political objective points</hi>, without the charge of technological maina.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>In fact, besides the intimate relations which exist between policy and war for the preparation of the latter, there are, in almost all campaigns, military enterprises, formed for satisfying political views, often very important, but frequently very unreasonable, and which, strategically speaking, would be grave faults, rather than useful operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>We shall limit ourselves to citing <num value="2">two</num> examples of them: the expedition of the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="York, York, England" key="tgn,7011995">York</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2068864" n="1.000 13" reg="dunkirk, chautauqua, new york">Dunkirk</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, suggested to the <rs>English</rs>, by ancient maritime and commercial views, gave to the operations of the <name>Allies</name> a divergent direction which caused their failure, and this objective point was good neither in strategy nor in tactics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>The expedition of the same prince to <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00102.00260" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>, equally dictated by the same views of the cabinet of <persName n="London,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00102.00261" reg="mostcommon:London,nomatch:0"><surname>London</surname></persName>, strengthened by the mental reservations of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> upon <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>, was not less fatal, in causing the march of the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00102.00262" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> from <placeName key="tgn,7007302" n="1.000 3" reg="zurich,zurich,schweiz,europe">Zurich</placeName> upon <placeName key="tgn,7013993" n="1.000 6" reg="manheim, lancaster, pennsylvania">Manheim</placeName>, an operation quite contrary to the manifest interests of the <name>Allies</name> at the epoch in which it was resolved upon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>These truths prove that the choice of political objective points ought to be subordinate to those of strategy, at least, so far as great military questions may be decided by arms.</p> 
<p>

<head>Lines of defense.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>Lines of defense are of several natures; they are strategical and tactical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/><pb id="p.104" n="104"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, there are those which are permanent, and relate to the system of defense of the <rs>State</rs>, as fortified frontier lines, &amp;c.; others which are only eventual, and have reference merely to the transient posisition where an army is found.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>The lines of frontiers are the permanent lines of defense, when they present a mixture of natural and artificial obstacles, such as chains of mountains, great rivers and fortresses, forming between each other a well connected system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Thus, the chain of the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> between <placeName reg="Piedmont" key="tgn,7003120">Piedmont</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, is a line of defense, since the practicable passages are garnished with forts which would interpose great obstacles to the enterprises of an army, and at the outlets of the gorges, great places of arms cover the different valleys of <placeName reg="Piemonte, Italia, Europe" key="tgn,7003120">Piedmont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>In the same manner the <rs>Rhine</rs>, the <name>Oder</name> and the <rs>Elbe</rs> may, in some respects, also be considered as permanent lines of defense, because of the important places which cover them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>All those combinations relating rather to a system of places than to the operations of a campaign, we shall treat of them in the article on fortresses, (Art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/><num value="26">26</num>.)</p> 
<p>With regard to <hi rend="italics">eventual lines of defense</hi>, it may be said that every considerable river, every chain of mountains, and every great defile, having upon its accessible points a few temporary intrenchments, may be regarded as a line of defense at once strategical and tactical, since it serves to suspend, for some days, the march of the enemy, and compels him often to deviate from his direct route to seek a less difficult passage; in this case it procures an evident strategic advantage; but if the enemy attack it in front, it has, unquestionably, a tactical advantage, since it is always more difficult to force an army behind a river, or in a post strong by nature and art, than to attack it in an open plain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>However, this tactical advantage must not be exaggerated, lest we should fall into the system of positions (<hi rend="italics">starke positionen</hi>,) which has caused the ruin of so many armies; for, whatever may be the difficulties at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of a defensive camp, it is certain that he who waits in it passively will end by succumbing.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/> 
<p>It must be observed that it is not a question here of fortified camps, which make a great difference, and will be treated of in Art. <num value="36">36</num>.</p></note> Besides, every position which is very strong by nature, being of difficult access,<note anchored="yes">

<head>Fronts of operations.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>A front of operations is the extent of a line which an army occupies in advance of its base, and in the sphere of which it acts momentarily, whether in an enemy's country, or in its own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>The front of operations seems, then, to be, in reality, only what is also called a transient line of defense; however, they are <num value="2">two</num> things which it is useful to distinguish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>In general, the line of defense implies with it a defensive idea, for an army which invades a country rarely occupies itself with choosing therein a line of defense, unless it be constrained to it by the unexpected turn of events; but, although it should not look to this precaution, that would not prevent its having a front of operations, even though it should move forward from success to success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>In my view, the term general front of operations ought to be applied to the whole front which an army presents to the enemy, within the extent of the zone adopted, and which can also be named the strategic front; whilst the line of defense will oftener be but a part of this front, where the army will have assembled its principal forces when it shall await the enemy in its positions; from whence it may be concluded: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, that the front of operations is a whole of which the line of defense forms but a part; 2dly, that the latter is ordinarily found in rear, or as a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of the former; 3dly, that the <num value="1">one</num> is applied especially to an army on the defensive, whilst the other is applicable equally to all acting armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>For example, at the time of the commencement of hostilities, at the end of <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, the general front of operations of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00105.00264" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> extended <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> from <placeName reg="Hamburg, Hamburg, Deutschland" key="tgn,7005289">Hamburg</placeName> to Wittenburg, from whence it ran along the line of the <name>Allies</name> to near Glogau and <placeName reg="Breslau, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086640">Breslau</placeName>, since his right was at Lowenberg; finally, he fell back in rear upon the frontier of Bohemia to <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>His forces were distributed upon this great front in <num value="4">four</num> masses, the strategic positions of which were interior or central.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Withdrawn later behind the <rs>Elbe</rs>, his real line of defense then extended only from <placeName key="tgn,2778530" n="1.000 1" reg="wittenberg, somerset, pennsylvania">Wittenberg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName>, with a crotchet in rear on <placeName reg="Marienberg, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz" key="tgn,1040244">Marienberg</placeName>; for <placeName reg="Hamburg, Hamburg, Deutschland" key="tgn,7005289">Hamburg</placeName> and Magdeberg even, were found already outside of his strategic field, and he would have been lost if he had thought of carrying his operations in that direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>As another example, I will cite his position around <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>His front of operations extended, in reality, from the mountains of <placeName key="tgn,7005025" n="1.000 1" reg="bergamo,bergamo,lombardia,italia,europe">Bergamo</placeName> <pb id="p.106" n="106"/>to the <rs type="place">Adriatic Sea</rs>, whilst that in need his true line of defense was upon the <name>Adige</name>, between <placeName reg="Lago di Garda, Italia, Europe" key="tgn,7008869">Lake Garda</placeName> and Legnano, afterwards on the <name>Mincio</name>, between Peschiera and <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>In a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> edition of this chapter, I cited for examples, the lines of the <name>Lech</name>, of the <name>Iser</name>, and of the <rs type="place">Inn</rs>, as fronts of operations for a French army acting in <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>, from whence it will be concluded, perhaps, that I confounded here the lines of defense with the front of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>But I spoke thus, regarding <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName> only as an isolated <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>, which it might be the question to cover; in reality, if we attach to the operations of that <name>French</name> army an idea more general, and based upon the lessons of history, it is certain that those rivers would be veritable lines of defense; whilst that in consequence of the combinations of the <name>Austrians</name>, the front of operations would embrace, perhaps, the <num value="2">two</num> banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913" n="1.000 10" reg="Donau,Europe">Danube</placeName>, and the part of the <name>Tyrol</name> the most adjacent to the theatre of war, that is to say, the <placeName reg="Tirol" key="tgn,7003029"><rs type="direction">northern</rs> Tyrol</placeName> to the <name>Brenner</name>; not that it would be necessary that all this space should be at the same time the theatre of simultaneous manoeuvres, but from the fact alone, that at any moment the presence of the enemy at a given point thereon, might be discovered, and the carrying there of considerable forces rendered necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>As fronts of operations and lines of defense are determined by circumstances and localities, there are few axioms to give relative thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>For the <num value="1">one</num> as for the other, it is important to have sure communications with the different points of the line of operations; it is advantageous also to have upon the flanks, the same as upon the front, great natural or artificial obstacles which may serve as points of support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>The points of support which a front of operations should offer, are also called <hi rend="italics">pivots of operations</hi>, these are partial bases for a given time, and must not be confounded with the pivots of a manoeuvre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>For example, in the campaign of <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, <placeName reg="Verona, Verona, Veneto" key="tgn,7003262">Verona</placeName> was an excellent pivot of operations for all the enterprises which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00106.00265" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> undertook around <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName> during <num value="8">eight</num> whole months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/><placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName> was in like manner in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, the pivot of all his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>Those points are temporary or eventual places of arms.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>The pivots of manoeuvre are the moveable corps that are left upon a point, the occupation of which is essential, whilst the bulk of the army marches to great enterprises; thus the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00106.00266" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName></orgName> was the pivot of the manoeuvre which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00106.00267" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> made by Donauwerth and <placeName key="tgn,7004324" n="1.000 1" reg="augsburg,schwaben,bayern,deutschland,europe">Augsburg</placeName>, to cut off <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00106.00268" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName> from his line of retreat; this corps increased to <num value="5">five</num> divisions, masked <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00106.00269" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, and held the left bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7012913" n="1.000 10" reg="Donau,Europe">Danube</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>The manoeuvre finished, the pivot ceased to exist, whereas, a pivot of operations is a material point, advantageous under the double strategical and tactical relation, and serves as a support for an entire period of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/><pb id="p.107" n="107"/></p> 
<p>With regard to the line of defense, the most desirable quality, in my view, is that this line be as little extended as possible, for the more contracted it shall be, the more easily will the army cover it, if it be thrown back upon the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>For the front of operations it is not altogether the same, because if this front were too contracted, it would be difficult for an offensive army to make strategic manoeuvres which might lead to great results, seeing that this contracted front would offer to the defensive army the means of covering it more easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>However, a too great front of operations is none the more suitable to the successes of offensive strategic operations; for a too immense extent would give to the enemy, if not a good line of defense, at least spaces vast enough for escaping the results of a well combined strategic manoeuvre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>Thus, the splendid operations of <placeName key="tgn,2035190;tgn,2028962" n="0.028 000000.2480	placename;tgn,2035190;marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.022 000000.1984	placename;tgn,2028962;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America" reg="marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America">Marengo</placeName>, <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00107.00270" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>, could not have had such results upon a theatre as extended as that of the war with <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 6" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, because the army, cut off from its principal line of retreat, could have found another by throwing itself upon a different zone from that which it had primitively adopted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>The direction which is given to a front of operations may have a notable influence upon the strategical movements of an army, and merits under this relation a particular attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>In general thesis, it seems that this front ought to be parallel to the primitive base, and to traverse the line of operations in a manner to extend beyond its <num value="2">two</num> sides to the end of better covering it; there are, nevertheless, circumstances in which it would be very advantageous, on the contrary, to present to the enemy a front of operations perpendicular to the general base and parallel to the principal line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>This direction might form thus a kind of new temporary or eventual base, which would place the army in a situation almost as favorable as that traced in the figure on <ref n="page 90">page 90</ref>, for the <rs>Army Fg</rs>, since it would procure the possession of <num value="2">two</num> sides of the strategic <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>. The front of operations which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00107.00271" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> adopted in his march upon <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName> presented all these peculiarities: his pivots of operations were at <placeName reg="Warsaw, Wyoming, New York" key="tgn,2072966">Warsaw</placeName> and at <placeName reg="Torun, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Polska" key="tgn,7007831">Thorn</placeName>, which made of the <name>Vistula</name> a sort of temporary base; the front of operations was parallel to the <name>Narew</name>, from whence <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00107.00272" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> departed, supporting himself on Sierock, Pultusk and Ostrolenka, to the end of manoeuvreing by his right, to throw the <name>Russians</name> upon <placeName reg="Elblag, Warminsko-Mazurskie, Polska" key="tgn,7007656">Elbing</placeName> and the <placeName reg="Baltic Sea" key="tgn,7013200">Baltic Sea</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>In such cases the front of operations, if it should find the least point of support in its new direction, would produce the same advantage that we have pointed out in Article <num value="18">18</num> for bases of operations perpendicular to those of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>It is merely necessary to keep in view that, for a like operation, an army must be sure of being able at need, to regain its temporary base; that is to say, it is indispensable that this base be prolonged far behind the strategic <pb id="p.108" n="108"/>front and be found covered by it: <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00108.00273" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> marching from the <name>Narew</name> by Allenstein upon <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>, had behind his left the place of <persName n="Thorn,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00108.00274" reg="mostcommon:Thorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Thorn</surname></persName>, and, farther still from the front of the army, the <hi rend="italics">tete de pont</hi> of Praga and <placeName reg="Warsaw, Wyoming, New York" key="tgn,2072966">Warsaw</placeName>; so that his communications were perfectly secure, whilst that <persName n="Benningsen,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00108.00275" reg="mostcommon:Benningsen,nomatch:0"><surname>Benningsen</surname></persName>, forced to face him and to take his line of combat parallelly to the <rs>Baltic</rs>, might be cut off from his base and rolled back upon the mouths of the <name>Vistula</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>A strategical front may be given a like direction perpendicular to the base, either by a temporary movement of conversion, executed for an operation of a few days merely, or by adopting it for an indefinite time, with the object of profiting from the advantages which certain localities might offer for procuring the army a good line of defense, and good pivots of operations which are equivalent almost to a real base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>It happens often that an army is compelled to have double fronts of operations, either from the configuration of certain theatres of war, or because that every line of offensive operations somewhat extended in depth, requires to be well secured on its flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case, the frontier of <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName> and that of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> might be cited as an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Armies which should wish to cross the <name>Balkan</name> or the <name>Ebro</name> would be forced to have a double front of operations: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for facing the <rs type="place">valley of the Danube</rs>, the other for showing front to forces coming from <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName> or from <persName n="Leon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00108.00276" reg="mostcommon:Leon,nomatch:0"><surname>Leon</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>All considerably vast countries present more or less that same necessity; for example, a French army marching &mdash; in the <rs type="place">valley of the Danube</rs> will always have, either on the side of Bohemia, or on the side of the <name>Tyrol</name>, need of a double strategical front, as soon as the <name>Austrians</name> should have thrown into these provinces corps sufficiently numerous to give it serious uneasiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Those countries alone, whose frontiers should be very narrow on the side of the enemy, would be exceptions, because the corps which should be left thereon, in retiring to menace the flanks of the enemy, would themselves be easily cut off and taken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>This necessity of double fronts of operations is <num value="1">one</num> of the gravest of inconveniences for an offensive army, since it compels great detachments, always injurious, as we shall see farther on (Art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/><num value="28">28</num>.)</p> 
<p>Before quitting subjects which are often confounded with each other in the same combinations, I ought to say a few words more upon strategical lines of defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>It is incontestable that each of these lines should have also, upon its development, a particular point upon which to rally for its tactical defense when it shall be the object seriously to combat the enemy who might have succeeded in crossing the front of the strategical position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/><pb id="p.109" n="109"/></p> 
<p>For example, every army guarding a considerable portion of the course of a river, not being able to hold in force the whole extent of this line, should have, a little in rear of the centre, a field of battle well chosen beforehand for gathering there its divisions of observation, and for opposing thus all its concentrated forces to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>I shall make no observations upon those positions of combat which, entering into the domain of tactics, will be treated of in Article <num value="31">31</num>, and I am to speak here only of strategic lines of defense; that is to say, those which make in some sort a part of the front of operations of an acting army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>A single remark remains for us to make upon these last, which is, that an offensive army, entering a country with the intention of subduing it, or even merely for occupying it temporarily, will always act with prudence, however great may have been its anterior successes, by preparing itself a good line of defense for serving it at need, as a refuge in the case of a reverse of fortune coming to change the face of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>These lines entering for the rest into the combination of the temporary or eventual bases of which we shall speak in Article <num value="23">23</num>, we shall limit ourselves to indicating them here in order to complete the sketch which we offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>It is seen then that this denomination may be equally applicable to all the situations in which an army might be found, either for covering several points at the same time, or forming any line of observation whatever; finally, for every position of expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>Thus the positions extended over a line of defense, a double front of operations, the corps covering a a siege whilst the army is operating on another side; in a word, almost all the great detachments composed of considerable fractions of an army are equally to be ranged in this category, or, more properly speaking, constitute the different parts of a strategical position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>The essential conditions for every such position are, that it be more concentrated than the hostile forces to which it should be opposed, and that all the parts of the army have easy and sure communications, in order to be able to unite without the enemy being in condition to offer opposition thereto; thus with nearly equal forces, all central or interior positions would be preferable to exterior positions, since the latter would necessarily embrace a much more extended front, and would occasion a scattering of forces, always dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>The great mobility of the parts which compose a strategic position can also contribute to their security, or even to their superiority, by the alternate employment of the forces upon all the important points of the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi>. Finally, an army could not occupy surely a strategic position, without taking the precaution to have <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> tactical positions fixed upon beforehand, with the view to uniting thereon, to receive the enemy and to combat him with all the disposable forces, when his projects should be well unmasked: it was thus that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00110.00280" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had prepared his battle fields of <placeName key="tgn,7005763" n="1.000 10" reg="Rivoli,Torino,Piemonte,Italia,Europe">Rivoli</placeName> and of <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Columbia, New York" key="tgn,2067890">Austerlitz</placeName> &mdash; <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00110.00281" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, that of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Seneca, New York" key="tgn,2072981">Waterloo</placeName>, and the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00110.00282" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName>, that of <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>In the strategic positions which an army takes in the course of a campaign, whether in march, whether for remaining in observation, or for awaiting the occasion for retaking the offensive, it will occupy also compact cantonments: these kinds of positions require on the part of the general, a practised calculation, for judging all that he may have to fear from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>The army ought to embrace a space sufficient for finding therein means of existence, and meanwhile it must remain as much as possible in condition to receive the enemy, should he present himself; <num value="2">two</num> conditions difficult enough to reconcile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>There is no better means than that of employing its divisions upon a space nearly square, that is to <pb id="p.111" n="111"/>say, as extended in depth as in breadth, in such a manner, that in case of necessity the army may be united upon any point of the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> where the enemy should chance to disturb it. <num value="9">Nine</num> divisions, placed thus at half a march from each other, may in <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> be united upon that of the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>There should be practised for the rest in such a case, all that is recommended for winter quarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>For the rest, as those strategical positions are connected with nearly all the combinations of a war, they will be represented in the greater part of the articles which treat of those divers combinations, and we could add nothing striking upon this subject without falling into repetitions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>From what precedes, <num value="1">one</num> could be convinced that the front of operations is the space embraced by the enterprises of an army, on the side where the enemy is found; that the line of defense is the part of that front where the bulk of the forces should be united when reduced to the defensive; finally, that strategic positions designate the provisory distribution of the forces of an army, whether upon the line of defense, or upon the front of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>It will be concluded from thence, in accordance with my views, that those <num value="3">three</num> combinations, which seem to be confounded with each other, so much analogy is there between them, are distinct objects, but that the same rules may apply equally to all <num value="3">three</num>; at least, in what concerns the manner in which the troops should be distributed and put in action.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>By zone of operations, there should be understood a certain fraction of the general theatre of war, which should be passed over by an army with a determinate aim, and principally when this aim should be combined with that of a secondary army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>For example, in the ensemble of the campaign of <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> was the zone of operations of the right; <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName> was that of the army of the centre (<persName n="Rhine,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00111.00283" reg="mostcommon:Rhine,nomatch:0"><surname>Rhine</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Moselle, Lorraine, France" key="tgn,7002972">Moselle</placeName>); finally, Franconia was the zone ofthe army of the left (Sambre and Meuse). <pb id="p.112" n="112"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>A zone of operations may sometimes present but a single line of operations, as much from the configuration itself of the country, as from the small number of routes practicable for an army which should be found therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>But this case is rare, and the zone will ordinarily present several lines of operations, the number of which will depend in part upon the projects of the general, and in part upon the number of great communications which the theatre should offer for his enterprises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>It ought not to be concluded from this, however, that each road is in itself a line of operations; doubtless, according to the turn which the events of the war might take, each good route at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> unoccupied could become momentarily a line of operations; but so long as it should be followed only by detachments of scouts, or should be found in a direction out of the sphere of the principal enterprises, it would be absurd to confound it with the real line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Besides that, <num value="3">three</num> or four practicable roads which should be found at <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> marches only from each other, and should conduct to the same front of operations, would not form <num value="3">three</num> lines of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>In fact, this name could only be given to a space sufficient for the centre and the <num value="2">two</num> wings of an army to be able to move thereon in the sphere of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> marches from each of those wings or extremities,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/> 
<p>This paragraph is rather obscure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>It should read, perhaps, this name could be given only to a space sufficient to allow an army to move in a sphere such that its wings may be separated by <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> marches from the centre.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>It may here be inferred that, if the words zone and lines of operations have been until now confounded and employed often the <num value="1">one</num> for the other, it has been the same in regard to lines of operations, strategic lines, and roads of eventual communication.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>I think, then, that the term <hi rend="italics">zones of operations</hi> ought to be employed to designate a great fraction of the general theatre of war; that of <hi rend="italics">lines of operations</hi> will designate the part of that grand fraction which an army will embrace in its enterprises, whether it follow several routes, or whether it follow but <num value="1">one</num>; the term <hi rend="italics">strategical lines</hi> would designate, then, the important lines which connect the different decisive points of the theatre of war, whether with each other, or with the front of operations of the army; finally, for the same reason, this name would be given also to the lines which an army would follow in order to attain those points, or to march to a decisive manoeuvre, and by deviating an instant from the <pb id="p.113" n="113"/>general line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>Finally, the term <hi rend="italics">lines of communications</hi> will be suitable for designating the different practicable routes which should be found in the extent of the zone of operations.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>Let us yet cite an example in order to render these ideas more clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>In <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, after <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> had acceded to the great coalition against <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00113.00284" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, <num value="3">three</num> allied armies were to invade <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName>, another <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>, and another <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>; thus <persName n="Saxony,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00113.00285" reg="mostcommon:Saxony,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxony</surname></persName>, or more properly speaking, the country situated between <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004456" n="1.000 1" reg="magdeburg,magdeburg,sachsen-anhalt,deutschland,europe">Magdeburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Wroclaw, Dolnoslaskie, Polska" key="tgn,7007601">Breslau</placeName>, formed, then, the <hi rend="italics">zone of operations</hi> of the principal mass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>This zone had <num value="3">three</num> <hi rend="italics">lines of operations</hi> conducting to the objective point, <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was that of the army of Bohemia, leading from the mountains of Erzgebirge by <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chemnitz, Chemnitz, Sachsen" key="tgn,7005951">Chemnitz</placeName> upon <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was the line of operations of the army of <placeName key="tgn,7007552" n="1.000 5" reg="silesia">Silesia</placeName>, going from <placeName reg="Wroclaw, Dolnoslaskie, Polska" key="tgn,7007601">Breslau</placeName> by <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName> or by Wittemberg upon <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>; finally, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> was the line of operations of the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000097" n="1.000 73" reg="sverige">Sweden</placeName>'s army, departing from <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName> to go by Dessau to the same objective point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>Each of those armies marched upon <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> routes parallel and little distant from <num value="1">one</num> another, meanwhile it could not be said that it had <num value="3">three</num> lines of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>This example will suffice, I trust, to demonstrate that this designation could not be applicable to every road that might be found upon the theatre of war, but rather to the portion of this theatre which the projects of the general will have embraced, and where he will have directed all his means of war, his active columns, his staple lines, his parks and depots.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>This distinction being well established, it remains for us to define what should be understood by <hi rend="italics">manoeuvre-lines</hi>. In my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> treatise, I had thought that I might give this name to all the combinations of a generalin-chief which relate to the choice of territorial lines of operations, that is to say, to the direction the most suitable to give to his forces in order to apply the general principles of war. This figurative expression has been judged of variously, because it has been taken literally, without the pains necessary to penetrate its meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>It is true that the same word has frequently been used to designate the divers strategic lines temporarily adopted for any enterprise whatever, and which are nevertheless not to be confounded with the general line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>To the end of distinguishing them, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> might be designated by the name strategical combinations of lines of operations, and the others could be called eventual <pb id="p.114" n="114"/>strategical lines of manoeuvre:<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/> 
<p>I will give an example of these <num value="2">two</num> combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>These are combinations of lines of manoeoeuvre-operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>In the same year, Wurmser, debouching from the <name>Tyrol</name> to the succor of <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> only the simple line of operations of the <name>Adige</name>, but arrived at <placeName reg="Rovereto, Trento, Trentino-Alto Adige" key="tgn,7005447">Roveredo</placeName> he formed <num value="3">three</num> columns separated by great obstacles; he operated then upon <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> momentary strategical lines</hi>, which were not general lines of operations.</p></note> we shall treat of the latter in a special article.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>If the choice of zones of operations offers few combinations, and depends more frequently upon the topography of the theatre of war, it is not always the same with the choice of lines of operations; for the latter relating especially to the position and the employment of the hostile forces, will necessarily offer complications more varied and susceptible of being subjected to rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>It must be owned, however, that the <name>Prussian</name> army did not give to its operations all the activity necessary for assuring their success; it remained <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> in its <placeName reg="camp of Kons">camp of Kons</placeName> to no effect; if it had anticipated Dumouriez at the <name>Islettes</name>, or had attempted more seriously to drive him from thence, it would have had still all the advantage of a mass concentrated against several isolated divisions, in order to overthrow them successively, and render their union impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/><num value="2">2</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>The advantage of this direction does not arise merely from the circumstance that in attacking an extremity, but a part of the hostile army is combatted; there is derived from it a still greater in that his line of defense is menaced and taken in reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>In order to avoid this danger, it is important to give to your line of operations a geographical and strategic direction, such, that the army preserve behind it a sure line of retreat, or that, at need, it may find <num value="1">one</num> on another side where it could throw itself, in order to regain its base by <num value="1">one</num> of those changes of lines of operations of which we shall speak hereafter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>And even if the <name>Prussians</name> had imagined they could cut him off from his lines of retreat by throwing themselves between <placeName reg="Gera, Como, Lombardia" key="tgn,7024451">Gera</placeName> and Bareith, then they would have opened to him his most natural line, the fine highway from <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName> to <placeName reg="Frankfort, Franklin, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013939">Frankfort</placeName>, besides the <num value="10">ten</num> roads which lead from <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName> through <placeName key="tgn,7004431" n="1.000 1" reg="kassel,kassel,hessen,deutschland,europe">Cassel</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7004448" n="1.000 1" reg="Koblenz, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, Deutschland">Coblentz</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004446" n="1.000 3" reg="koln,koln,nordrhein-westfalen,deutschland,europe">Cologne</placeName>, and even <placeName key="tgn,7005168" n="1.000 10" reg="Wesel,Dusseldorf,Nordrhein-Westfalen,Deutschland,Europe">Wesel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>Here is enough to prove the importance of those kinds of combinations; let us return to the series of maxims announced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/><num value="4">4</num>. To manoeuvre wisely, it is necessary to avoid forming <num value="2">two</num> independent armies upon the same frontier; such a system could scarcely be suitable except in cases of great coalitions, or when there should be immense forces which could not be made to act upon the same zone of operations without being exposed to an incumbrance more dangerous than useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>Still, even in this case would it not always be better to subject these <num value="2">two</num> armies to <num value="1">one</num> chief, who would have his Headquarters with the principal army?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/><num value="5">5</num>. In consequence of the principle we have just announced, it is certain that with equal forces, a simple line of operations on the same frontier will have the advantage over a double line of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/><num value="6">6</num>. It may happen nevertheless, that a double line becomes necessary, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, from the configuration of the theatre of. war, afterwards, because the enemy will have formed <num value="1">one</num> himself, and it will be necessary to oppose a part of the army to each of the <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> masses which he will have formed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/><num value="7">7</num>. In this case, the interior or central line will be preferable to the exterior line, since the army which shall have the interior line will be able to make each of its fractions co-operate in a plan combined between them, and can thus assemble the mass of its forces before the enemy, for deciding upon the success of the campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>An army whose lines of operations should offer such advantages would then be in condition, by a strategical movement, well combined, to overthrow successively the fractions of the adversary which should offer themselves alternately to its blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>To assure the success of this movement, <pb id="p.128" n="128"/>a corps of observation would be left before the part of the hostile army which it should be desired merely to hold in check, prescribing to it not to accept a serious engagement, but to content itself with suspending the march of the enemy by favor of the accidents of the ground, and in falling back upon the principal army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/><num value="8">8</num>. A double line may be suitable also when you have a numerical superiority so decided, that you can manoeuvre in <num value="2">two</num> directions without being liable to see <num value="1">one</num> of your corps overthrown by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>In this hypothesis it would be a fault to accumulate your forces on a single point, and thus to deprive yourself of the advantages of your superiority, by rendering it impracticable for a part of your forces to act. Nevertheless, in forming a double line, it will always be prudent to reinforce suitably the part of the army which, by the nature of the theatre of war and the respective situations of the <num value="2">two</num> parties, would be called upon to play the most important part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/><num value="9">9</num>. The principal events of the late wars prove the correctness of <num value="2">two</num> other maxims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, that <num value="2">two</num> interior lines, sustaining each other reciprocally, and showing front, at a certain distance, to <num value="2">two</num> masses superior in numbers, ought not to allow themselves to be compressed by the enemy in a too contracted space, where they might end by being simultaneonsly overthrown, as happened to <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00128.00339" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in the celebrated battle of <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is that interior lines ought not to go either into the contrary excess, by extending to a too great distance, for fear of allowing the enemy time to gain decisive successes against the secondary corps left in observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>It could be done, nevertheless, when the principal object in view should be so decisive that the whole fate of the war might depend upon it; in this case, <num value="1">one</num> could look with indifference upon what might happen at secondary points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/><num value="10">10</num>. For the same reason, <num value="2">two</num> concentric lines are preferable to <num value="2">two</num> divergent lines; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, more conformed to the principles of strategy, procure moreover the advantage of covering the lines of communications and of supply; but in order that they be exempt from danger, they should be combined in such a manner that the <num value="2">two</num> armies which pass over them, may not meet separately the united forces of the enemy, before being themselves in condition to operate their junction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/><num value="11">11</num>. Divergent lines may nevertheless be suitable, either after a battle gained, or after a strategic operation by which you will have succeeded in dividing the forces of your adversary by breaking his centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>Then it becomes natural to give your masses excentric directions in order to finish the dispersion of the vanquished; but, although acting upon divergent <pb id="p.129" n="129"/>lines, those masses will nevertheless find themselves on interior lines, that is to say, more approached to each other, and more easy to reunite than those of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/><num value="12">12</num>. It happens at times that an army sees itself forced to change its line of operations in the midst of a campaign, which we have designated under the name of accidental lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the most delicate and important of manoeuvres, which may give great results, but may lead also to great reverses, when it is not combined with sagacity, for it is scarcely used but for extricating an army from an embarrassing situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>We have given, in Chapter X. of the <name>Treatise</name> on grand operations, an example of such a change, executed by <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> in the course of the raising of the siege of <placeName reg="Olomouc, Severomoravsky, Ceska Republika" key="tgn,7011841">Olmutz</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00129.00340" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> projected several of them, for he was accustomed, in his adventurous invasions, to have such a project ready for parrying unexpected events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>At the epoch of the <rs n="Battle of Austerlitz" type="battle">battle of Austerlitz</rs>, he had resolved, in case of check, to take his line of operations through Bohemia upon <placeName key="tgn,7004407" n="1.000 10" reg="Passau,Niederbayern,Bayern,Deutschland,Europe">Passau</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7013496" n="1.000 10" reg="Regensburg,Oberpfalz,Bayern,Deutschland,Europe">Ratisbon</placeName>, which offered to him a country, new and full of resources, instead of retaking that by <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, which offered nothing but ruins, and on which the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00129.00341" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> might be able to anticipate him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>In <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, he commenced the execution of a manoeuvre more bold, but favored at least by localities, and which consisted in basing himself upon the belt of fortresses of Alsace and <persName n="Lorraine,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00129.00342" reg="mostcommon:Lorraine,nomatch:0"><surname>Lorraine</surname></persName>, opening to the allies the road to <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>It is certain that had <persName n="Mortier,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00129.00343" reg="mostcommon:Mortier,nomatch:0"><surname>Mortier</surname></persName> and <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00129.00344" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName> been able to join him, and he had had <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men more, this project would have been followed by the most decisive results, and put the seal to his brilliant military career.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/><num value="13">13</num>. As we have said above (maxim <num value="2">2</num>), the configuration of frontiers and the geographical nature of the theatre of operations, may exercise a great influence upon the direction itself to be given to these lines, as well as upon the advantages to be derived from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>Those central positions which form a salient angle towards the enemy, like <placeName reg="Ceska Republika" key="tgn,7006470">Bohemia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Switzerland" key="tgn,7011731">Switzerland</placeName>, are the most advantageous, because they naturally lead to the adoption of interior lines and facilitate the means of taking the enemy in reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>The sides of this salient angle are so important there that it is necessary to join all the resources of the art to those of nature to render them unattackable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>In default of those central positions, they might be supplied by the relative direction of manoeuvre lines as the following figure shows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/><pb id="p.130" n="130"/> <figure id="fig.130"> 
<head>Diagram.</head></figure> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>C D manoeuvering upon the right flank of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A B; and H I directing itself upon the left flank of F G, will form <num value="2">two</num> interior lines, C K and I K, upon an extremity of each of the exterior lines A B, F G, which they will be able to overthrow <num value="1">one</num> after the other by carrying alternately against them the mass of their forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>This combination presents the results of the lines of operations of <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, of <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/><num value="14">14</num>. The general configuration of the bases may also have a great influence upon the direction to be given to the lines of operations, which must naturally be subordinate to the situation of their respective bases, as will be obvious by recalling what we have said before upon this article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>Indeed, by a simple examination of the figure annexed to said article, <ref n="page 90">page 90</ref>, it will be seen that the greatest advantage which would result from the conformation of frontiers and bases, would consist in prolonging the latter perpendicularly to the base of the enemy, that is to say parallelly to his line of communications, which would give the facility of seizing this line, and of separating thus the enemy from his base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>But if, instead of directing your own operations so as to effect this, you choose badly the direction of your line, all the advantage of the perpendicular base will become null.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>It is evident that the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> E, which should possess the double base A C and C D, if it marched by the left towards the point F, instead of prolonging itself by its right towards G H, would lose all the strategical advantages of its base, C D. (See <ref n="page 90">page 90</ref>.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>The great art of directing our lines properly consists, then, as we have just seen, in combining their relations with the bases and with the movements of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>in such a manner as to be able to seize upon the communications <pb id="p.131" n="131"/>of the enemy without being liable to lose our own; a strategical problem the most important as it is the most difficult to resolve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/><num value="15">15</num>. Independently of the cases before cited, there is yet <num value="1">one</num> which exercises a manifest influence upon the direction to be given to lines of operations; it is that in which the principal enterprise of the campaign should consist in effecting the passage of a great river in the presence of a large and intact hostile army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>In this case, it is sensibly felt that the choice of the line of operations could not depend merely upon the will of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, or upon the advantage which he would find in attacking a certain part of the hostile line; for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be considered, is to know the point where the passage could be effected most surely, and that upon which would be found the material means necessary to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>The passage of the <rs>Rhine</rs> by <persName n="Jourdan,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00131.00345" reg="mostcommon:Jourdan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jourdan</surname></persName>, in <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct>, was executed near Dusseldorff, for the same reason which decided that of the <name>Vistula</name> by <persName n="Paskievitch,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0005.00131.00346" reg="mostcommon:Paskievitch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Paskievitch</surname></persName> near Ossick, <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>; that is to say, because the army not having in its train a sufficient bridge equipage, it was necessary to send up large commercial ships bought in <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName> by the <rs>French</rs> army, the same as the <rs>Russian</rs> army had purchased theirs at <placeName reg="Torun, Kujawsko-Pomorskie, Polska" key="tgn,7007831">Thorn</placeName> and Dantzic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>The neutral territory of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> furnished, in these <num value="2">two</num> circumstances, the facility of sending those vessels up the river, without the enemy being able to interpose any obstacle thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>This facility, of an incalculable advantage in appearance, forced the <rs>French</rs> nevertheless to the double invasions of <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct> and of <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, which failed precisely because the double line of operations resulting therefrom gave the means of partially defeating them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>When there are military positions in sufficiency, there are less vicissitudes to be undergone in the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>Meanwhile, it is necessary still to choose the point which offers the most chances of success in consequence of the localities and the position of the hostile forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>The discussion between <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00131.00348" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> and <persName n="Moreau,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00131.00349" reg="mostcommon:Moreau,nomatch:0"><surname>Moreau</surname></persName> about the passage of the <rs>Rhine</rs> in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, which I have reported in the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> volume of the <name>History</name> of the wars of the <name>Revolution</name>, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most curious examples of the different combinations which this at once strategical and tactical question presents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>The position chosen for the passage exercises the same influence upon the direction suitable to give to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> marches after it is effected, in view of the necessity of covering the bridges against the enemy, at least until after a victory; this choice may nevertheless, in every state of things, present a just application of principles for it will definitively be limited <pb id="p.132" n="132"/>always to the single alternative of a passage upon the centre or upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>An army united, which should force the passage upon <num value="1">one</num> of the points of the centre, against a somewhat extended cordon, could divide itself afterwards into <num value="2">two</num> divergent lines to the end of dispersing the parts of the hostile cordon which, being found thus out of condition to unite, will scarcely think of troubling the bridges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>If the line of the river be sufficiently short to allow the hostile army to remain concentrated, and if the means be had of taking after the passage a front of operations perpendicular to the river, then it would be best perhaps to pass it upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/><num value="1">one</num> of the extremities, to the end of throwing back all the hostile forces out of the direction of the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>For the rest we shall treat of this subject in Article <num value="37">37</num>, on the passage of rivers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/><num value="16">16</num>. There is still a combination of lines of operations, which ought not to be passed over in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>It is the notable appearance which exists between the chances of a line of operations established in <num value="1">one</num>'s own country and that established in a hostile country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>The nature of these hostile countries will have an influence also upon those chances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>An army crosses the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> or the <rs>Rhine</rs> to carry war into <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> or <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; it finds at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, States of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> order; supposing even that their chiefs are allied to each other, there will be nevertheless in the real interest of those small States, as well as in their populations, rivalries which would prevent the same unity of impulsion and of force which would be met with in a great State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>The dogmatic form would have suited the professors better, I own; but I doubt whether it would have been as clear and as strongly demonstrative for young officers, as the historical form adopted in my treatise on grand military operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>Some of my critics have gone so far as to censure the term lines of operations, which I give to surfaces, and to sustain that the true lines of operations were rivers; an assertion which, to say the least of it, is strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>No person would take it into his head to say that the <rs>Danube</rs> or the <rs>Rhine</rs> are lines of operations, upon which an army can act. Those rivers would be at the most lines of supply for facilitating arrivals, but not for manoeuvering an army; unless its chief had the miraculous power of making an army march in the midst of the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>My critic will say, perhaps, that he meant to speak of valleys and not of rivers; I would have him observe then, that a valley and a river are meanwhile, very different things, and that a valley is also a surface, and not a line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/><pb id="p.142" n="142"/></p> 
<p>Thus, in the physical sense, as in the didactic sense, the definition is doubly inexact, but supposing it even tolerable, still it would be necessary that a river, in order to be used as a line of operations for an army, should always flow in the direction in which this army should march; and it is almost always the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>The greater part of rivers are rather defensive barriers or <hi rend="italics">fronts of operations</hi>, which they could not be, and considered at the same time as lines of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>The <rs>Rhine</rs> is a barrier for <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> as for <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>; the lower <rs>Danube</rs> is a barrier for <placeName reg="Turkiye" key="tgn,1000144">Turkey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>; the <name>Ebro</name> is a barrier for <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, the <name>Rhone</name> is a barrier against an army which should come from <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> to attack <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>; the <rs>Elbe</rs>, the <name>Oder</name>, the <name>Vistula</name>, are barriers against armies marching from west to east, or from east to west.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>We have made mention, in Articles <num value="19">19</num> and <num value="21">21</num>, of strategical lines of manoeuvre, which differ essentially from lines of operations; it will not be useless to define them, for many military men frequently confound them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>Strategical lines are of several kinds, as has been seen in Article <num value="19">19</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>We have not occupied ourselves with those which have a general and <pb id="p.143" n="143"/>permanent importance from their situation, and from their relations with the configuration of the country, such as the lines of the <rs>Danube</rs>, or of the <name>Meuse</name>, the chains of the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> and the <name>Balkan</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>As the latter figure in the number of the decisive points of the theatre of war, or in that of the lines of defense of which we have already spoken, and as they are traced by nature, we shall have nothing to say of them, for they could be subjected to no other investigation than the detailed and profound study of the military geography of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and to a description, the immense scope of which, it may well be supposed, does not accord with that of this summary; the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00143.00394" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> has given an excellent model of this study in his description of <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Southern Germany</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>But we name strategic lines also, all the communications which lead by the most direct or the most advantageous way from <num value="1">one</num> important point to another, as well as from the front of operations of the army to all the objective points which it may have the project to attain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>It is comprehended, therefore, that the whole theatre of war is found furrowed with such lines, but that those which it should be wished to pass over with any object whatever, are alone of any-real importance, at least for a given period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>This fact will suffice to make comprehended the great difference which exists between a general line of operations adopted for a whole campaign, and those eventual strategical lines, changeable as the operations of armies themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>Finally, independently of material or territorial strategical lines, we have already said that there existed a kind of combination, in the disposition and the choice of those lines, which constitutes as many different manoeuvres, and we have named them <hi rend="italics">strategical lines of manoeuvre</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>An army which should have <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> for a general <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chequier</hi>. would take for zone of operations the space between the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> and the <rs>Danube</rs>, or else that between the <rs>Danube</rs> and the <rs>Main</rs>, finally, that between the mountains of <placeName reg="Franken, Deutschland, Europe" key="tgn,7012456">Franconia</placeName> and the sea.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>It may be affirmed, then, without incurring the blame of creating a confusion of words, that all the definitions given in the preceding article for lines of operations, are necessarily reproduced for strategical lines, and also the maxims which are derived from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Those lines must be <hi rend="italics">co&ngrave;centric</hi> when the object is to prepare for a decisive shock, then <hi rend="italics">excentric</hi> after the victory; strategical lines are rarely simple, for an army will scarcely march upon a single road, but when they shall be double, triple, quadruple even, they must also be interior if the forces of the armies are equal, or exterior for those which should have a great numerical superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>We could, it is true, deviate at times from the too strict application of this maxim, by throwing an isolated corps in an exterior direction, even in case of an equality of forces, when it shall be the question to obtain a great result without running great risks, but this is already entering again into the category of detachments, which we shall treat separately, and could not be applicable to principal masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>Of course strategical lines couid not be interior in the case when our efforts should be directed against an extremity of the hostile front of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>Departing from thence, it will seem that all the maxims which we have presented upon lines of operations, would be the only ones which we could reproduce, and our readers will not blame us for sparing them their repetition; they can easily of themselves make the application of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>There is, meanwhile, <num value="1">one</num> which it is our duty to point out: it is that in general, in the choice of momentary strategical lines, it is important to avoid wholly uncovering the line of operations and exposing it to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>This may be tolerated when it is the question to extricate <num value="1">one</num>'s self from a great danger or to seek great results; but it is necessary at least; even in this case, to prepare the means of escape by <num value="1">one</num> of those sudden changes of lines of operations which we have before indicated, and it is important that the operation be not of long duration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>I have enlarged upon this incident to show that the calculation of time and distances, joined to a great activity, can cause to succeed enterprises in appearance altogether imprudent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>I conclude from thence, that it is sometimes permitted to throw an army momentarily on a direction which would uncover its lines of operations, but that all measures should be taken that the enemy do not profit from it, as much by the rapidity of its execution, as by demonstrations which might deceive him, and leave him in ignorance of what is passing.

<head>Article <num value="23">XXIII</num>: means of assuring lines of operations by transient bases or strategical reserves.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>When you penetrate offensively into a country, you may, and you ought even, to form <hi rend="italics">eventual bases</hi> which, without being either as strong or as sure as those of your own frontiers, can nevertheless be considered as temporary bases; a line of river with <hi rend="italics">tetes de ponts</hi>, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> large cities secure from a <hi rend="italics">coup de main</hi> for covering the grand depots of the army, and to serve for the union of the troops of reserve, may form an excellent base of this kind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>Such a line, however, could not of course serve as a transient base, if a hostile force were found in proximity with the line of operations which should conduct from this supposed base to the real base of the frontiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>Thus <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00147.00421" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> would have had a good real base on the <rs>Elbe</rs>, in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, if <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> had remained neutral: but this power having declared against him, the line of the <rs>Elbe</rs> being taken in reverse, was no longer but a very good pivot of operations for favoring a momentary enterprise, but dangerous in the end, if <num value="1">one</num> chanced to sustain there a notable check.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>Now as every army beaten in a hostile country may always be exposed to his adversary manoeuvering in a manner to cut it off from its frontiers if it persisted in remaining in the country, it must indeed be acknowledged that those remote temporary bases will be rather momentary points of support than real bases, and that they enter in some sort into the category of eventual lines of defense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>However this may be, we cannot either flatter ourselves with always finding, in an invaded country, posts secure from insult, fit to offer as points of support suitable for forming even a temporary base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>In this case we might supply it by the establishment of a strategic reserve, an invention altogether peculiar to the modern system, and the advantages, as well as the inconveniences of which deserve to be examined. </p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>Reserves play a great part in modern wars; scarcely was there an idea of them formerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>From the government which prepares the national reserves, down to the chief of a platoon of skirmishers, each at this day wishes to have his reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Besides the national reserves, of which we have spoken in the chapter on military policy, and which are only raised in urgent cases, a wise government takes care to assure good reserves for completing the active armies; it is, then, for the <rs>General</rs> to know how to dispose of them when they are in the circumference of his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>A State will have its reserves, the army will have its own, each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, and even each division or detachment will not fail either to assure itself <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The reserves of an army are of <num value="2">two</num> kinds: those which are in the line of battle, ready for combat, those which are destined to keep the army full, and which, whilst organizing, may occupy an important point of the theatre of war, and serve even as strategical reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>Doubtless many campaigns have been undertaken and brought to a successful close without such reserves being thought of; their establishment also depends, not only upon the extent of the means that can be disposed of, but still more upon the nature of the frontiers, and the distance which separates the front of operations, or the objective aim from the base.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>However, so soon as the invasion of a country is decided upon, it is natural to think of the possibility of being thrown back upon the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>Now, the establishment of a reserve intermediate between the base and the front of operations, offers the same advantage as she reserve of an active army will procure on the day of battle; for it can fly to the important points which the enemy should menace, without enfeebling the acting army for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>In truth, the formation of such a reserve will require a certain number of regiments which must be drawn from the active army; meanwhile it cannot be denied that a rather large army has always reinforcements to expect from the interior, recruits to instruct, moveable militia to exercise, regimental depots and convalescents to turn to account; in organizing then a system of central depots for laboratories of munitions and equipment, by causing to be united to those depots all the detachments going to and returning from the army, joining thereto <pb id="p.149" n="149"/>merely a few battalions of good troops, to give a little more consistency, a reserve would thus be formed from which eminent services might be drawn.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>We understand by the ancient system of positions, that ancient manner of making war with armies encamped in tents, living by their magazines and their bakeries, reciprocally watching each other, the <num value="1">one</num> for besieging a place, the other for covering it; the <num value="1">one</num> coveting a small province, the other opposing its designs by self-styled impregnable positions; a system which was generally in practice from the middle ages down to the <rs>French</rs> revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/><pb id="p.151" n="151"/></p> 
<p>In the course of this revolution great changes supervened; but there were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> divers systems, and they were not all improvements in the art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>It was not until <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, when it saw itself assailed within and without, that the republic threw a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men and <num value="14">fourteen</num> armies upon its enemies; of necessity other methods were to be taken; those armies having neither tents, nor pay, nor magazines, marched, bivouacked or cantoned; their mobility was increased by it, and became an instrument of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Their tactics changed also; their chiefs held them in columns, because they are more easy to manage than deployed lines, and by favor of the broken country of <persName n="Flanders,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00151.00434" reg="mostcommon:Flanders,nomatch:0"><surname>Flanders</surname></persName> and the <placeName reg="Vosges" key="tgn,1109783">Vosges</placeName>, where they fought, they threw out a part of their forces as skermishers to cover their columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>This system, which was born thus of circumstances, succeeded at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> beyond all expectation; it disconcerted the methodical troops of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, as well as their chiefs: <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00151.00435" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName>, among others, to whom the successes of the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Coburg, Oberfranken, Bayern" key="tgn,7004330">Coburg</placeName> were attributed, augmented his reputation by publishing instructions for extending lines to the end of opposing a thinner order to those skermishers!

<p>Until then the <rs>French</rs> armies had embraced great fronts, either more easily to obtain provisions, or that their generals imagined they were doing well in putting all their divisions in line, leaving to their chiefs the care of disposing of them for combat as they could, and keeping in reserve but slender detachments incapable of repairing any thing, if the enemy chanced to overthrow a single <num value="1">one</num> of those divisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Such was the state of things when <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00152.00442" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> made his debut in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>; the rapidity of those marches routed the <name>Austrians</name> and Piedmontese from the commencement of his operations; for, disengaged of all useless material, he surpassed the mobility of all modern armies; he conquered the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> by a series of strategical marches and combats.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>The campaign of <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, more characteristic still, signalised a new era in the projection of plans of war, and in the directions of lines of operations; from thence date those bold objective points, which have in veiw nothing less than the capture or destruction of armies, and of which we have spoken in Article <num value="19">19</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>Orders of battle were equally less extended, the organization of armies into corps of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> divisions, became more rational.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The system of modern strategy was from that time carried to its zenith, for the campaigns of <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> were only corollaries of the great problem resolved in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>With regard to tactics, that of columns and of skermishers, which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00152.00444" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> found quite established, suited too well the broken country of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> not to be adopted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>At this day there presents itself a grave and capital question, it is to decide whether the system of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00152.00445" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> is suitable to all capacities, to all epochs, and to all armies; or if, on the contrary, it were possible that governments and generals could return to the methodical system of wars of position, after having meditated upon the events of <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>Let us compare, in fact, the marches and encampments of the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War, with those of the <measure n="7weeks" type="date">seven weeks</measure> war, (an epithet which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00152.00446" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> gave to the campaign of <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>,) or with the <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> which elapsed from the departure from the <rs type="place">camp of Boulogne</rs> in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, to the arrival upon the plains of <placeName reg="Morava" key="tgn,7006467">Moravia</placeName>, and let us decide then whether the system of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00152.00447" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> is preferable to the ancient <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>This system of the <rs>French Emperor</rs> was <hi rend="italics">to make <num value="10">ten</num> leagues a day, to</hi> <pb id="p.153" n="153"/><hi rend="italics">combat, and to canton afterwards in repose</hi>. He has himself told me that he recognized no other kind of war than this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>It will be objected that the adventurous character of this great captain was joined to his personal position, and to the situation of minds in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, to excite him to do what no other chief would have dared to do in his place, whether lie were born upon a throne, or whether he were a simple general under the orders of his government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>If this is incontestable, it appears to me true also, that between the system of immoderate invasions and that of positions, there is a medium, so that, without imitating his impetuous audacity, it will be possible to follow the routes which he has trodden, and that the system of wars of position will probably be proscribed for a long time, or at least considerably modified and improved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>Doubtless, if the art is found enlarged by the adoption of the system of marches, humanity will lose thereby more than it will gain, for those rapid incursions, and those bivouacs of considerable masses, feeding from day to day upon the same countries which they invade, do not badly recall the devastations of the peoples which overran <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> to the <num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>However, it is little probable that they will be renounced so soon, for a great truth has been at least demonstrated by the wars of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00153.00448" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, it is that distances could no longer secure a country from invasion, and that States which wish to secure themselves from it, ought to have a good system of fortresses and lines of defense, a good system of reserves and military institutions, finally, a good system of policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>Therefore, the populations organize themselves every where into militia, to serve as reserves to the active armies, which will maintain their force upon a footing more and more formidable; now, the greater armies are the more necessary the system of rapid operations and prompt denouements becomes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>If, in the sequel, social order recovers a calmer tone, if nations, instead of combatting for their existence, fight no longer except for relative interests, to round their frontiers, or to maintain the <rs>European</rs> equilibrium; then a new law of nations may be adopted; and it will perhaps be possible to put armies upon a less exaggerated footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>Then also, in a war of power against power, armies of <num value="80">eighty</num> or a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men may be seen to return to a mixed system of war, which would hold the middle ground between the volcanic incursions of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00153.00449" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and the impossible system of the <hi rend="italics">Starke Positionen</hi> of the last century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Until then we must admit this system of marches which has produced so great events, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> who should dare to renounce it in presence of a capable and enterprising enemy, would probably become its victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/><pb id="p.154" n="154"/></p> 
<p>By the science of marches, we do not understand at the present day, simply those minute details of logistics which consist in well combining the order of troops in column, the time of their departure and arrival, the precautions necessary in their journey, the means of communication, either between themselves, or with the point which is assigned them, these are all things which make an essential branch of the functions of the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>But, besides these very material details, there exists a combination of marches which belong to the grand operations of strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>For example, the march of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00450" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> by the <rs>St. Bernard</rs>, to fall upon the communications of <persName n="Melas,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00451" reg="mostcommon:Melas,nomatch:0"><surname>Melas</surname></persName>; those which he made in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct> by Donauwert, to cut off <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00452" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName>, and <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> by <placeName reg="Gera, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012815">Gera</placeName>, to turn the <name>Prussians</name>; the march of Suwaroff to fly from <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName> upon Trebbia to meet <persName n="Macdonald,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00453" reg="mostcommon:Macdonald,nomatch:0"><surname>Macdonald</surname></persName>; that of the <rs>Russian</rs> army upon Taroutin, then upon <placeName key="tgn,7010181" n="1.000 10" reg="Krasnoi,lost and found/Moldova,Moldova,Europe">Krasnoi</placeName>, were decisive operations, not from their relations with <hi rend="italics">la logistique</hi>, but from their relations with strategy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>However, properly considered, those skillful marches are never but means of putting in practice, the various applications of the principle which we have indicated, and which we shall yet develope; to make a fine march, is then nothing else than carrying the mass of <num value="1">one</num>'s forces upon the decisive point; now, the whole science will consist in determining well that point after the manner we have essayed to demonstrate in Article <num value="19">19</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>In fact, what was the march by the <rs>St. Bernard</rs>, if not a line of operations directed against an extremity of the strategic front of the enemy, and from thence upon his line of retreat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>What were the marches to <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00454" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> but the same manoeuvre?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>What was the march of <persName n="Blucher,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00455" reg="mostcommon:Blucher,nomatch:0"><surname>Blucher</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Waterloo, Seneca, New York" key="tgn,2072981">Waterloo</placeName>, but the application of the interior strategical lines recommended in Article <num value="22">22</num>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>Hence it may be concluded, that all strategical movements which tend to direct the masses of an army successively upon the different points of the hostile front of operations, will be skillful marches, since they will apply the <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> indicated, <ref n="page 81">page 81</ref>, by putting in action the mass of forces upon fractions merely of the hostile army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>The operations of the <rs>French</rs> at the end of <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, fron <placeName key="tgn,2068864" n="1.000 13" reg="dunkirk, chautauqua, new york">Dunkirk</placeName> to <placeName reg="Landau in der Pfalz, Rheinhessen-Pfalz, Rheinland-Pfalz" key="tgn,7012952">Landau</placeName>, those of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00154.00456" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, in <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct> and in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, may be cited as models of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>It would be useless to enlarge upon those combinations, since they enter by their applications in the series of maxims already presented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>We shall observe, nevertheless, that there exists a species of marches which have been designated under the name of flank marches, and which we could not pass over in silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>In all times they have been presented as hazardous manoeuvres, without any thing satisfactory having ever been <pb id="p.155" n="155"/>written on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>If we understand thereby tactical manoeuvres made in view of the hostile line of battle, doubtless such a flank movement is a very delicate operation, although it succeeds at times; but if ordinary strategical marches are meant, I can see nothing dangerous in a flank march, unless the most common logistical precautions have been neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>In a strategical movement, the <num value="2">two</num> hostile main bodies ought always to be separated by an interval of about <num value="2">two</num> marches, (counting the distance which separates the respective advanced guards, from the enemy and from their own columns.) In such a case there could exist no real danger in the strategical journey from <num value="1">one</num> position to another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>There are <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure>, nevertheless, where a flank march seems altogether inadmissible: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that where the system of the line of operations, of the strategical lines and front of operations, should all present the flank to the enemy in the whole course of an enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Such was the famous project of marching upon <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipzig</placeName>, without being disquieted about <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName> and the <num value="250000">two hundred and fifty thousand</num> men of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>, a project which, resolved upon at Trachenberg in the month of <dateStruct value="1813-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, would probably have been fatal to the allied armies, if my soliditations made at Jungferteinitz, had not caused it to be modified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> case is when we should have a remote or deep line of operations, like that of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00155.00457" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Borodino, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2068136">Borodino</placeName>; especially if this line of operations offered still but a single suitable line of retreat; then every flank movement which should leave it exposed, would be a grave fault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>In countries where good secondary communications should be numerous, flank movements would be less dangerous, because at need <num value="1">one</num> could have recourse to a change of line of operations if he were repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>The physical and moral state of armies, the more or less energetic character of the chiefs and of the troops, could also have an influence upon the opportuneness of such movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>In fact, the often cited marches of <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> and of <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00155.00458" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName> were veritable flank manoeuvres, quite like that upon <placeName key="tgn,2059733" n="1.000 4" reg="milan, sullivan, missouri">Milan</placeName> after the passage of the <name>Chiusella</name>, and like that of <persName n="Paskiewics,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0005.00155.00459" reg="mostcommon:Paskiewics,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Paskiewics</surname></persName> for crossing the <name>Vistula</name> at Ossiek; every <num value="1">one</num> knows how they succeeded.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/>The general of an army ought to know how to make all the existing resources of the country he invades concur in his enterprises; he must employ the authorities, when they remain therein, to levy uniform and legal requisitions, which he will cause to be paid for when he has the means of so doing; when the authorities do not remain, he should establish provisory ones, composed of the notables, and clad with extraordinary powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>He will cause those provisions required to be collected upon points the most favorable to the movements of the army, according to the principles of lines of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>To the end of husbanding the supplies, he will cause to be cantoned in the cities and villages the greatest possible numbers of troops, securing an indemnity to the inhabitants for the surcharge which will result therefrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>The army, besides its provisions and forage, will have parks of auxiliary carriages furnished by the country, in order that the provisions may reach it wherever it should remain stationary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>It is as difficult to establish rules as to what it would be prudent to undertake, without forming magazines in advance, as to trace the exact demarcation between the possible and impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>The countries, the seasons, the force of the armies, the spirit of the population, all vary in these combinations; but we may establish as general maxims:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/><num value="1">1</num>. That in fertile and populous countries, the inhabitants of which should be hostile, an army of a <num value="100">hundred</num> or a hundered and <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men moving towards the enemy, but yet sufficiently distant to embrace without danger, a certain extent of country, may march during the whole time that a given operation may require, drawing its resources from the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>Now, as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> operation never requires more than a month for the bulk of its masses to be in motion, it will suffice to provide, by reserve supplies, for the eventual necessities of the army, and especially for those of the forces which should be obliged to remain stationary at the same point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>For example, the <orgName>army of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00158.00468" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></orgName>, half'united around <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00158.00469" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>, to blockade <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00158.00470" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName> therein, might have need of biscuit until the surrender of the city, and if it were wanting the operation might fail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/><num value="2">2</num>. During this time, it would be necessary to apply <num value="1">one</num>'s self to collecting, with all possible activity, the resources which the country offers, in <pb id="p.159" n="159"/>order to form magazines of reserve, and to relieve the wants which the army should experience after the success of the operation, whether for concentrating in positions of repose, or for departing from thence, and marching to new enterprises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/><num value="3">3</num>. The magazines which should have been collected by purchase, or requisitions upon the country, ought to be disposed as much as possible in echelons, on <num value="3">three</num> different rays of communications, which will facilitate on <num value="1">one</num> side the supply of each of the wings of the army, and on the other the greatest possible extension of the sphere of successive requisitions; finally, the means of better covering, if not the whole, at least a good part of the line of depots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>With this last aim it would not be useless that the depots of the <num value="2">two</num> wings should be established on rays converging towards the principal line of operation, which will ordinarily be found to be that of the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>By this precaution <num value="2">two</num> real advantages will be obtained, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, of placing the magazines in greater security from the insults of the enemy, by augmenting the distance which separates them from him; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> would be to facilitate the concentric movements in rear, which the army might execute, in order to unite on a single point of the line of operation, with the object of falling in its turn upon the enemy, and of wresting from him, by seizing again the initiative of attack, the momentary ascendancy which he should have acquired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/><num value="4">4</num>. In countries where the population is too sparse, and the soil little fertile, an army will lack the most essential resources; hence it will be prudent not to remove it too far from its magazines, and to carry along supplies of reserve sufficient to give it time, at need, to fall back upon the base of its grand depots.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/><num value="5">5</num>. In national wars, and in countries where the whole population flies and destroys every thing, as has happened in <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, <placeName reg="Portugal" key="tgn,1000090">Portugal</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Turkiye" key="tgn,1000144">Turkey</placeName>, it is impossible to move without being followed by regular magazines, and without having a sure base of supplies in proximity with the front of operations, which renders a war of invasion much more difficult, not to say impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/><num value="6">6</num>. It does not suffice to assemble immense provisions, there is yet necssary the means of causing them to follow the army, and it is in this that consists the greatest difficulty, especially when it is wished to march to brisk and rapid enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>In order to facilitate the march of the magazines it is necessary, in the first place, to compose them of the most portable provisions, such as biscuit, rice, &amp;c.; then it will be necessary to have military carriages which unite lightness and solidity, to the end of being able to pass over all kinds of roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>It is important, also, as we <pb id="p.160" n="160"/>have said, to collect the greatest number possible of the vehicles of the country, taking care that the proprietors or conductors be well treated and protected by the troops; parks of them will be formed in echelons in order not to remove them too far from their homes, and to have successive resources husbanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Finally, it will be necessary to habituate the soldier to carry for a few days biscuit, rice, or even flour, in default of other provisions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/><num value="7">7</num>. The neighborhood of the sea offers very great facilities for the supplying of an army; that <num value="1">one</num> which is master of the sea, it seems ought never to want for anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>However, this advantage is not without its inconvenience for a great continental army, for with the object of remaining in sure relations with its magazines, it will allow itself to be drawn into carrying its operations upon the shore, which would expose it to cruel disasters, if the enemy acted with the mass of his forces upon the extremity opposite to the sea.<note anchored="yes">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/><num value="8">8</num>. The continental army, which shall employ the sea to facilitate its arrivals, must not neglect to have its principal base of operations by land, with a reserve of supplies, independent of maritime means, and a line of retreat upon the extremity of its strategical front opposite the sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/><num value="9">9</num>. The rivers or navigable streams, whose course should be nearly parallel with the routes which should serve as a line of operations to an army, would furnish, as well as canals, great facilities for the transportation of provisions; and although these means are not comparable to those which great navigation procures, they would, notwithstanding, be very valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>It is concluded thence with reason that lines of operations parallel to a river are the most favorable, especially in that they render arrivals more easy, and permit a great diminution of the embarrassment of carriages; but so far from the river being within itself the true line of operations, as has been pretended, it would be necessary always to have care that the greater part of the troops should be able to keep removed from it, to the end of preventing the enemy, coming to attack them in force on the extremity opposite to the river, from placing them in a position quite as fatal as if they were hemmed in upon the sea. <pb id="p.161" n="161"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>It must be observed, however, that in a hostile country it is very rare to be able to profit by a river for the arrival of provisions, either because of the destruction of its vessels, or because light corps might disturb its navigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>In order to render it sure it would be necessary to direct corps upon the <num value="2">two</num> banks, which is not without danger, as <persName n="Mortier,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00161.00471" reg="mostcommon:Mortier,nomatch:0"><surname>Mortier</surname></persName> experienced at Dirnstein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/><num value="10">10</num>. In default of bread or biscuit, flesh upon the foot has often sufficed for the immediate wants of an army; and in populous countries, beasts are always sufficiently abundant to provide it for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>But these resources are soon exhausted, and they drive troops to marauding; it is important, then, to regulate by all means possible the requisitions for beasts, to pay for them if practicable, and especially to cause the columns to be followed by bullocks bought out of the sphere of the marches of the army.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>I have heard him say that, in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> campaigns, the hostile army was always so well provided that, when he found himself embarrassed to feed his own, he had only to throw it upon the rear of the enemy, where he was certain to find every thing in abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>A committee assembled, some years since, to determine upon those fortresses, concluded that it was necessary to add still more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>That does not prove that there are not already too many, but that rather there are some wanting upon important points, whilst that those of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, too much accumulated, ought to be maintained because they exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>Every military man will agree that these are as many as are necessary; for the front of <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 4" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> and the coasts of the ocear require less than those of the north-east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>The essential thing in order that they attain their object, is to establish them according to a well combined system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>If <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> had a less considerable number of places, it is because she was surrounded by the small States of the <rs>Germanic Empire</rs> which, far from menacing her, put their own fortresses at her disposition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>Moreover, the number indicated expresses only that which appears necessary for a power presenting <num value="4">four</num> fronts nearly equal in development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>This truth admitted, it must be acknowledged also, that places established at the confluence of <num value="2">two</num> great rivers have the advantage of commanding <num value="3">three</num> different fronts of operations, which augments their importance; (the place of <persName n="Modlin,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00165.00480" reg="mostcommon:Modlin,nomatch:0"><surname>Modlin</surname></persName> is a case in point.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1682"/>Formerly the false system prevailed of investing a place by a whole army, which buried itself in lines of circumvallation and countervallation, requiring as much expense and trouble as the siege itself.

<p>Continuous lines are referred to here; we should not neglect to fortify a position of investment by detached works.</p></note> However, whilst censuring lines of circumvallation, it is necessary to acknowledge the necessity for an investing corps, to double the force of its positions by detached works, which should command the issues by which the garrison or succoring troops could disturb it, as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00168.00492" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> did at <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>, and the <name>Russians</name> at Varna.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1687"/>Besides lines of circumvallation and countervallation, of which we have spoken above, there exists another kind, which, more vast and extensive still, belong in some sort to permanent fortification, since they are to cover a part of the portion of a State</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1688"/>The system of such intrenched lines is as absurd, as a fortress or intrenched camp constructed to serve as a momentary refuge to an army, is advantageous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1689"/>It is conceived that the question here is not of a line of intrenchments of little extent, which would close a narrow gorge; this enters into the system of forts, like that of Fussen or of Charnitz, of which we have spoken; but the question is of lines extended over several leagues and destined to close the whole of a section of frontier, as for example those of Wisesmburg; covered by the <name>Lautern</name> which runs before the front, supported on the <rs>Rhine</rs> at the right and the <placeName reg="Vosges" key="tgn,1109783">Vosges</placeName> at the left, those lines seemed to fulfill all the conditions necessary for being secure from attack, and yet they were forced as often as they were assailed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1690"/>The lines of Stollhofen, which played upon the right of the <rs>Rhine</rs> the same part as those of Wissemburg upon the left, was not more fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>Those of the <name>Queich</name> and of the <name>Kinzig</name> had the same fate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1692"/>The lines of <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName>, (<dateStruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></dateStruct>) and those of Mayence (<dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct>), though destined to serve for circumvallation, offer a complete analogy, to all possible lines, if not by their strength, at least by their extent, and by the fate which they experienced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1693"/>However well supported these lines may be by natural obstacles, it is certain that independently of their great extent, which paralyses their defenders, they will almost always be susceptible of being turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1694"/>To be buried thus in intrenchments where we could be outflanked, enveloped and compromised, and where we are always forced in front even though we should be secure against being turned, is then a manifest folly, which it is to be hoped will never occur again.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1697"/>Meanwhile it will not be useless to add here, that as ridiculous as it would seem at this day to bury ourselves in continuous lines, equally absurd would it be to neglect the use of detached works for augmenting the strength of a siege corps, the security of a position, or the defense of a defile which enters, for the rest, into the categories of which we shall treat further on. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/>It would be misplaced to give here details upon the situation of ordinary camps, upon the disposition and formation of advanced guards, as well as upon the resources which field fortifications offers for the defending of posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>Intrenched camps alone belong to the combinations of grand tactics, and even of strategy, by the support which they lend momentarily to an army.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>It is known how many advantages <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00170.00497" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> derived from that of <persName n="Torres,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00170.00498" reg="mostcommon:Torres,nomatch:0"><surname>Torres</surname></persName>-Vedras, and those which Shoomla procured the <name>Turks</name>, for defending the country between the <rs>Danube</rs> and the <name>Balkan</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>The regulating principle to be given upon this matter, is that camps be established upon a point at once strategical and tactical; if that of Drissa was useless to the <name>Russians</name> in <num value="1.812">1.812</num>, it is because it was placed out of the true direction of their defensive system, which was to pivot upon Smoleusk and <placeName reg="Moskva, Moskva, Rossiya" key="tgn,7012974">Moscow</placeName>; it was therefore necessary to abandon it at the end of a few days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>The maxims which we have given for determining great decisive points in strategy, may be applied to all intrenched camps, for it is upon such points merely that it is proper to place them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>The destination of these camps varies; they may serve equally as points of departure for an offensive operation, as <hi rend="italics">tetes de ponts</hi> for debouching beyond a great river, as supports for winter cantonments, finally as places of refuge for a beaten army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1706"/>Meanwhile, however good may be the site of an intrenched camp, we may be assured, unless it be, like that of <persName n="Torres,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00170.00499" reg="mostcommon:Torres,nomatch:0"><surname>Torres</surname></persName>-Vedras, on a peninsula, backed, against the sea, and destined to protect the re-embarkation of an insular army, it is very difficult to find a strategical point secure from <pb id="p.171" n="171"/>being turned by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1707"/>So soon as such a point can be turned either by the right or by the left, the army which occupies it will be forced to abandon it, or run the risk of being invested therein; the intrenched <placeName reg="camp of Dresden">camp of Dresden</placeName> offered in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct> an important support to <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00171.00500" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>; as soon as he was outflanked by the <name>Allies</name>, it had not even the advantages which an ordinary place would have procured, for its extent caused to be sacrificed to it <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi> which were lost in a few days, for want of provisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1708"/>In spite of these truths, it must be owned that intrenched camps, being seldom destined but to procure a temporary point of support for a defensive army, they may always accomplish their object, though even the enemy might be able to pass beyond them strategically; the essential thing is that they be not liable to be assailed in reverse, that is to say that all its faces be equally secure from a sudden attack, and besides that they be in proximity with a fortress, either for securing the magazines therein, or for covering the front of the camp most adjacent to the line of retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1709"/>In general such a camp, situated upon a river, with a vast <hi rend="italics">tete de pont</hi> on the other side to command the <num value="2">two</num> banks, and placed near a great fortified city offering resources, like Mayence or <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>, will assure to an army incontestable advantages; but it will never be more than a temporary refuge, a means of gaining time and of assembling reinforcements; when it shall be the question to drive away the enemy, it will ever be necessary to have recourse to open field operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> maxim which may be given upon these camps, is that they are especially favorable for an army at home, or near its base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>If a French army threw itself in an intrenched camp on the <rs>Elbe</rs>, it would none the less be ruined for it, so soon as the space between the <rs>Rhine</rs> and the <rs>Elbe</rs> should be occupied by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>But if it were found even momentarily invested in an intrenched camp under Strassburg, it could with the least succor retake its superiority and hold the field: the hostile army which should be invested, itself placed in the middle of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, between the succoring corps and that of the intrenched camp, would have much to do to repass the <rs>Rhine</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>Thus far we have considered these camps under the exclusively strategical point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>Meanwhile several <name>German</name> generals have pretended that intrenched camps were calculated to cover places and to prevent their siege, which appears to me a little sophistical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>Doubtless a place will be less easy to besiege so long as the army shall remain encamped upon its glacis, and it may be said that those camps and places lend each other a mutual support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1716"/>But in my opinion the true and principal design of intrenched <pb id="p.172" n="172"/>camps will always be to give at need a temporary refuge to an army, or will be an offensive means for debouching upon a decisive point and beyond a great river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1717"/>To bury an army under a place, to expose it to be outflanked and cut off, merely to retard a siege, appears to me an act of folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>They will cite the example of Wurmser who, they say, prolonged for several months the resistance of <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Mantua</placeName>: but did not his army perish therein?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>Was this sacrifice in reality useful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>I do not think so, for the place having been once delivered and re-victualed, and the siege park having fallen into the power of the <name>Austrians</name>, the attack was obliged to be changed to a blockade: now, as the place could only be taken by famine, Wurmser ought rather to have hastened its surrender than retarded it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>The intrenched camps which the <name>Austrians</name> had established before Mayence in <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct> would have prevented, it is true, the siege of that city if the <rs>French</rs> had had the means of making it, at least as long as the <rs>Rhine</rs> should not have been crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>But so soon as <persName n="Jourdan,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00172.00501" reg="mostcommon:Jourdan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jourdan</surname></persName>, in contempt of that camp, showed himself on the <name>Lahn</name>, and <name>Moreau</name> in the <rs>Black Forest</rs>, it was necessary to raise it and to abandon the place to its own defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>There would be then only the case where a fortress were found situated upon a point so extraordinary that it became impossible to pass beyond without taking it, that we could construct an intrenched camp with the special destination of preventing its attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>What place in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> can flatter itself with occupying such a site?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>Far then from sharing the idea of those <name>German</name> authors, it appears to me on the contrary that a question of considerable importance in regard to the establishment of those intrenched camps in transient fortification, under places in reach of a river, would be to decide, whether it were better that the camp be situated upon the same bank as the place, or rather if the latter should not be found on the opposite bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>In the case where it should be indispensable to choose between these <num value="2">two</num> propositions, in default of being able to situate the place in a manner to embrace the <num value="2">two</num> banks at the same time, I should not hesitate to pronounce for the latter course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>In fact, in order to serve as a refuge or to favor a debouch, it is very necessary that the camp be beyond the river on the side of the enemy: in this case the principal danger to be feared would be that the enemy should take the camp in reverse by passing the river some leagues farther off: now if the place were found on the same side as the camp, it would be of no use to him, whereas if it were found constructed on the opposite bank in front of the camp, it would be almost impossible to take it in reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/><pb id="p.173" n="173"/>Thus the <rs>Russian</rs> army, which could not hold the <rs type="place">camp of Drissa</rs> <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> (in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>), would have been able to brave the enemy therein for a long time, if a place had existed on the right bank of the <name>Dvina</name> in order to put the rear of the camp under shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Thus <persName n="Moreau,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00173.00502" reg="mostcommon:Moreau,nomatch:0"><surname>Moreau</surname></persName> braved for <num value="3">three</num> whole months all the efforts of the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00173.00503" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,1039835" n="1.000 10" reg="Kehl,Freiburg,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Kehl</placeName>, whereas if Strassburg had not been on the opposite bank, the camp could easily have been turned by a passage of the <rs>Rhine</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>In truth it would be desirable that the camp should have also its protection upon the same bank, and under this aspect a place holding both banks would well fulfill the double destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1731"/>That of <placeName key="tgn,7004448" n="1.000 1" reg="Koblenz, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, Deutschland">Coblentz</placeName>, recently constructed seems to mark the epoch of a new system: that which the <name>Prussians</name> have adopted at this place, and which participates at the same time of intrenched camps and permanent places, would merit a profound examination; but if this vast establishment offers some defects, it may be affirmed nevertheless that it would also offer immense advantages to an army destined to operate on the <rs>Rhine</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1732"/>In fact, the inconvenience of temporary intrenched camps established on great rivers, is that they are scarcely useful except when they are found beyond the river, as we have said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1733"/>Now in this case, they are exposed to all the dangers resulting from a capture of the bridges, which might place the army in the same position as that of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00173.00504" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,1004446" n="1.000 10" reg="Essling,Wien,Wien,Osterreich,Europe">Essling</placeName>, and would leave it exposed to a total want of provisions or munitions, as well as to the perils of an attack by storm from which field works would not always be secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/>The system of detached forts in permanent fortifications, such as has been applied at <placeName key="tgn,7004448" n="1.000 1" reg="Koblenz, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, Deutschland">Coblentz</placeName>, offers the advantage of averting these dangers, by putting the magazines under shelter of the city &mdash; situated upon the same bank as the army, and by guaranteeing the latter against an attack, at least until the establishment of the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>If the city were on the right bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611" n="1.000 1" reg="rhein,europe">Rhine</placeName>, and there existed only an intrenched camp of field works on the left of the river, there would be on the contrary no positive security, either for the magazines or for the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>In the same manner if Coblintz were a good ordinary fortress, without detached forts, a considerable army would not find therein an asylum so easily, and especially would it have much less facility for debouching therefrom in presence of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>However if <placeName key="tgn,7004448" n="1.000 1" reg="Koblenz, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, Deutschland">Coblentz</placeName> is a formidable establishment the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein, which is to protect the right bank, is defective in being of so difficult access that the blockade of it would be all the more easy as the debouch for a considerable army could be effectively disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/><pb id="p.174" n="174"/></p> 
<p>The new system employed by the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Maximiliun,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0005.00174.00505" reg="mostcommon:Maximiliun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Maximiliun</surname></persName> for fortifying the intrenched <placeName reg="camp of Linz">camp of Linz</placeName> by means of towers in masonry has been much spoken of for some time past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>As I am only acquainted with it by hearsay I could not reason upon it particularly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>I only know that the system of towers which I have seen employed at <placeName key="tgn,7008546" n="1.000 5" reg="genova,genova,liguria,italia,europe">Genoa</placeName> by the skillful <persName n="Andreas,Colonel,,,," id="n0051.0005.00174.00506" reg="mostcommon:Andreas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Andreas</surname></persName>, has appeared to me susceptible of being turned to account and improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>I have been assured that the towers constructed at Linz sunk in the ditches and covered by the glacis, had the advantage of giving a razant and cross fire, and of being concealed from the direct shots of the enemy's cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>Such towers well flanked and connected by a parapet, may make a very advantageous camp but always subject nevertheless to the inconvenience of closed lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>If the towers are isolated and covered with care in the intervals by field works which could be thrown up in time of war, they will be better doubtless than a camp covered merely by <hi rend="italics">fleches</hi> and ordinary redoubts, but they do not seem to offer as many advantages as the great detached forts of <placeName key="tgn,7004448" n="1.000 1" reg="Koblenz, Koblenz, Rheinland-Pfalz, Deutschland">Coblentz</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>These towers are <num value="40">forty</num> in number, armed each with <num value="6">six</num> pieces which can be concentrated on whichever side may be desired; their fire may be crossed; they are connected by a palisaded covered way, and by a broad ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>Whatever defect may be found in such an establishment, there is no doubt that it would have exercised a great influence upon the events of <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct> if it had existed at that epoch, for the strategic point is the best chosen, as well as all those of the other establishments which <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> has made since <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>.<note anchored="yes">

The difficulties which the passage of rivers and especially <pb id="p.175" n="175"/>of great rivers offer when they have place in front of an enemy, suffice to demonstrate the immense utility of tetes-de-ponts; we can indeed do much better without intrenched camps than without these works, for in putting your bridges secure from insult you secure yourself against all the disastrous chances which could result from the forced retreat upon the banks of a river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>When those tetes-de-ponts serve as a redoubt to a large intrenched camp they are then doubly advantageous; they will be triply so if they embrace likewise the bank opposite to that where the camp should be seated, since then these <num value="2">two</num> establishments will lend each other a mutual support, and will equally assure the <num value="2">two</num> banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>It would be useless to add that those works are especially important in a hostile country, and upon all fronts where there should not exist a permanent place which could dispense with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>I shall observe still that the principal difference between the system of intrenched camps and that of tetes-de-ponts, is that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> are preferable when they are composed of detached and closed works, whilst that tetes-de-ponts will oftener be contiguous enclosed works: but if they are composed of detached works a feeble corps would suffice to secure them from insult.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>As for the rest those intrenchments enter into the same class as those of camps, and as their attack or defense belongs more particularly to tactics, we shall speak of them in Chapter <num value="4">IV</num>, Article <num value="36">36</num>; it suffices to have pointed out here their strategical importance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>The detachments which an army may be called upon to make in the <pb id="p.176" n="176"/>course of a campaign, are so closely connected with the success of all its enterprises, that they should be regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the most important, but also <num value="1">one</num> of the most delicate branches of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>In fact if nothing is more useful than a great detachment when it is seasonably made and well combined, nothing is more dangerous when it is made in an inconsiderate manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>Frederick the <rs>Great</rs> even counted in the number of the most essential qualities of a General that of knowing how to induce his adversary to detachments, either in order to carry them off, or to attack the army during their absence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>The mania of detachments has been so much abused that, by a contrary excess, many have believed in the possibility of doing without them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Doubtless it would be much more sure and agreeable to keep an army united in a single mass; but as it is a thing entirely impracticable, it is very necessary to be resigned to make detachments when it becomes indispensable to the success of the enterprise which it should be wished to form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>The essential thing is to make as few of them as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>There are several kinds of them:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/><num value="1">1</num>. The great corps thrown outside of the zone of operations, in order to effect divisions upon points more or less essential;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/><num value="2">2</num>. The great detachments made in the zone of operations to cover the important points of that zone, to form a siege, to guard a secondary base, and to protect the line of operations if it be menaced;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/><num value="3">3</num>. The great detachments made upon fronts of operations, in face of the enemy, to concur directly in a concerted enterprise;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/><num value="4">4</num>. The small detachments thrown at a distance to attempt <hi rend="italics">coups-de-main</hi> upon posts the taking of which might act favorably.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>I understand by diversions, those secondary enterprises formed far from the principal zone of operations, at the extremities of a theatre of war, and upon the concurrence of which the success of a campaign should be foolishly calculated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Such diversions are only useful in <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure>, that where the corps employed in making it should be out of condition, from its distance, to be put in action elsewhere; or else when it should be thrown upon a point where it would find a great support among the population, which enters in the domain of political combinations more than in those of the military art. A few examples will not be out of place to illustrate this.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>These are proofs against diversions: let us cite an example of the circumstances where they would be suitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>In the civil wars of <dateStruct value="1793--"><year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, if the <name>Allies</name> had detached from their armies <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> veteran troops to disembark them in Vendee, they would have produced a much greater effect than by augmenting the masses which warred without success at <placeName reg="Toulon, Var, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur" key="tgn,7008794">Toulon</placeName>, on the <rs>Rhine</rs> and in <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Here is a case where a diversion might have been not only very useful, but decisive</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>We have said that independently of remote diversions and of light corps, great detachments were frequently employed within the zone of the operations of an army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>If the abuse of these great detached corps for objects more or less secondary, presents still, more dangers than the abuse of diversions, it is nevertheless but just to acknowledge that they are often advantageous, at times even indispensable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>Those detachments are of <num value="2">two</num> principal kinds: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> consists in the permanent corps which we are obliged sometimes to establish in a direction opposed to that on which we are operating, and which are to manoeuvre thereon during the whole campaign; the others are corps detached temporarily to exercise a salutary influence upon any enterprise whatever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>In the number of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ought to be placed, before all, the fractions detached armies, whether for forming the strategic reserve of which we have spoken, or for covering lines of operations and of retreat, when the configuration of the theatre of war may leave them exposed to the blows of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>For example, a Russian army, wishing to cross the <name>Balkan</name>, is forced to leave a part of its forces to observe Shoomla, Ruschuk and the <rs type="place">valley of the Danube</rs>, the direction of which is such that it chances to fall perpendicularly upon the line of operations: whatever success be obtained, <pb id="p.178" n="178"/>it will always be necessary to leave a respectable force either near Giurgewo, or near Craiova and even to the right of the river near Ruschuk.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>This single example suffices to prove that there are cases where a double front of operations could not be dispensed with, which from that time will require considerable corps to be detached to show front to a portion of the hostile army which might be left in rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>We could cite other localities and other circumstances where this measure would not be less necessary; the <num value="1">one</num> is the double front of operations of the <name>Tyrol</name> and the <name>Frioul</name> for a French army which passes the <name>Adige</name>; on whatever side it wishes to direct its principal effort, it could not do it without leaving upon the other front, a corps proportioned to the hostile forces which might there be found, otherwise it would abandon all its communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> example is the frontier of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, which presents also to the <name>Spaniards</name> the facility of presenting a double front of operations, the <num value="1">one</num> covering the direct road to <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, the other being based either upon <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName>, or upon Galicia; on whatever side it is wished to act, a detachment proportioned to the enemy must be left near the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>All that can be said upon this matter, is that it is advantageous to enlarge as much as possible the field of operations, and to render moveable those forces left in observation, whenever it can be done, and that it will be the object to strike decisive blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most remarkable proofs of this truth was given by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00178.00516" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> in the campaign of <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>Obliged to leave a corps of <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men in the <rs type="place">valley of the Adige</rs>, to hold the <name>Tyrol</name> whilst directing himself on the <name>Noric</name> <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, he preferred to draw in this corps at the risk of compromising for a moment his line of retreat, rather than leave the <num value="2">two</num> fractions of his army disunited and exposed to be overthrown in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>Persuaded that he should conquer with his army if he united it, he judged that the momentary presence of a few hostile detachments upon his communications would not then be dangerous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>Great moveable and temporary detachments are made for the following motives:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/><num value="1">1</num>. To constrain the enemy to a retreat by menacing his line of operations, or to cover your own;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/><num value="2">2</num>. To march to meet a hostile corps, and to prevent its junction, or to facilitate the junction of an expected reinforcement;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/><num value="3">3</num>. To observe and to hold in check a great fraction of the hostile army, whilst you project striking a blow at the other portion of that army; <pb id="p.179" n="179"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/><num value="4">4</num>. To seize a considerable convoy of provisions or of munitions upon which would depend the continuation of a siege, or the success of a strategical enterprise; to protect the arrival of a convoy which you yourself may expect;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/><num value="5">5</num>. To operate a demonstration with a view to drawing the enemy in a direction where you desire him to march, in order to facilitate an operation undertaken on another side;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/><num value="6">6</num>. To mask and even to invest <num value="1">one</num> or several great places for a given time, whether you may wish to attack them, or whether you desire merely to shut up the garrison in its ramparts;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/><num value="7">7</num>. To carry an important point upon the communications of an enemy already in retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>However seductive it may appear to obtain the divers objects indicated in this nomenclature, it must be owned, nevertheless, that these are always objects more or less secondary, and that the essential thing being to triumph on decisive points, you must guard against yielding to the attractions of multiplied detachments, for many armies have been seen to succumb for not having known how to remain concentrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>We shall recall here several of those enterprises to prove that their success or their loss depends, sometimes upon reasonableness, sometimes upon the genius of him who directs them; oftener still upon faults of execution.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>That of <persName n="Fink,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00179.00521" reg="mostcommon:Fink,nomatch:0"><surname>Fink</surname></persName> was destroyed at <persName n="Maxen,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00179.00522" reg="mostcommon:Maxen,nomatch:0"><surname>Maxen</surname></persName> almost upon the same ground and for the same reason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>With regard to demonstrative divisions made in the same sphere with the army, they have a positive advantage, when they are combined with <pb id="p.180" n="180"/>the object of making the enemy arrive upon a point where it is convenient to fix his attention, whilst the weight of the forces are assembled upon a quite opposite point where it is desired to strike an important blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>It is necessary then not only to avoid engaging the corps which is employed in this demonstration, but to recall it promptly upon the main body; we shall cite <num value="2">two</num> examples, which will prove the opportuneness of this precaution.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>Those kinds of operations, far from being contrary to principles, are necessary to favor their application.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>It will easily be conceived, from all that precedes, that absolute maxims could not be given upon operations so varied, and the success of which depends upon so many particulars thus difficult to seize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>It will be for the talents and the <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> of generals to judge when they should risk those detachments; the only admissable precepts we have already presented; they are to make as few of them as possible, and to draw them in as soon as they have accomplished their mission.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>For the rest their inconvenience can be remedied in part, by giving good instructions to those who command them; it is in this that consists the greatest talent of a general of the staff.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>Since we have cited the small detachments destined for <hi rend="italics">coups de main</hi>, in the number of those which may be useful, we shall indicate a few of this nature, which will enable us to form a judgment thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a model of operations on an <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> entirely mountainous; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is <num value="1">one</num> for wars where the fate of mountainous countries is to be decided upon plains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>I shall endeavor to recapitulate here some of the truths which have appeared to me to result from this examination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>When a country, cut up with mountains, over its whole surface becomes the principal <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> of the operations of the <num value="2">two</num> armies, the combinations of strategey cannot be calculated entirely upon the maxims applicable to open countries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>In fact, the transversal manoeuvres for gaining the extremities of the front of operations of the enemy, then become of a more difficult execution, and are often even impossible; in such a country <num value="1">one</num> can operate with a considerable army only in a small number of valleys, where the enemy shall have had care to place sufficient advanced guards, to the end of suspending the march as long as would be necessary to take into consideration the means of defeating the enterprise; and as in the counterforts which separate those valleys there ordinarily exist only foot-paths insufficient for the movements of armies, no transversal march could have place thereon but for light divisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>The important strategical points, marked by nature at the confluence <pb id="p.185" n="185"/>of the principal valleys, or, if it be preferred, at the confluence of the rivers which they enclose, are so clearly traced, that it were to be blind to mistake them; now, as they are small in number, the defensive army occupying them with the mass of its troops, the aggressor will oftener be reduced, in order to dislodge it therefrom, to have recourse to direct attacks or main force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>However, if great strategical movements are more rare and more difficult on such a theatre, it is not saying that they are on that account the less important; on the contrary, if you succeed in seizing upon <num value="1">one</num> of these knots of communication of great valleys, on the line of retreat of the enemy, his loss is still more certain than in open countries, because by occupying on this line <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> defiles of difficult access, it would often suffice for causing the ruin of a whole army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>But if the attacking party have difficulties to overcome, it must be owned also that the defensive army has no less of them, from the necessity which it thinks there is of covering all the issues by which <num value="1">one</num> might arrive in mass upon those decisive points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>In order to make better comprehended what I have just said upon transversal marches, and upon the difficulty of directing them in mountains as easily as in plains, I shall be permitted to recall the <num value="1">one</num> which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00185.00539" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> made in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, to cut off <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00185.00540" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName> from <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00185.00541" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName>; if it were facilitated by the <num value="100">hundred</num> roads which furrow Suabia in all directions; if it had been impracticable in a mountainous country, for want of transversal routes for making the long tour from Donanwerth by <placeName key="tgn,7004324" n="1.000 1" reg="augsburg,schwaben,bayern,deutschland,europe">Augsburg</placeName> upon Memmingen, it must be admitted also that, by favor of those <num value="100">hundred</num> roads, <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00185.00542" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName> would equally have been able to make his retreat more easily than if he had been surrounded in <num value="1">one</num> of those valleys of <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 4" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> and of the <name>Tyrol</name> from whence <num value="1">one</num> could only issue by a single road.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>On the other hand, the general who is reduced to the defensive may, in an open country, preserve a very great part of his forces united, for if the enemy divide in order to occupy all the roads which that general would be at liberty to take in his retreat, it will be easy for him to cut his way through this multitude of isolated divisions; but in a very mountainous country, where an army has ordinarily but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> principal issues, into which several other valleys chance to terminate in the same direction occupied by the enemy, the concentration of forces is more difficult, seeing that, if a single <num value="1">one</num> of those valleys be neglected, there might result grave inconveniences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Nothing, in fact, could better demonstrate the difficulty of the strategic defense of mountains than the embarrassment in which <num value="1">one</num> finds himself <pb id="p.186" n="186"/>when he wishes to give, not rules, but even advice to generals charged with such a task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>If the only question were the defense of a definite point of operations, of small extent, formed by <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> valleys or convergent rays terminating at the central knot of those valleys, at <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> small marches from the summits of the chain, no doubt the thing would be more easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>It would suffice then to recommend the construction of a good fort upon each of those rays, at the point of the defile which is narrowest and the most easy to turn; then to place, under the protection of those forts, some brigades of infantry to dispute the passage, whilst that a reserve of the half of the army, placed at this central knot of the union of the valleys, would be in condition either to sustain those advanced guards most seriously menaced, or to fall in mass upon the enemy when he should attempt to debouch, and when we would have united all the columns to receive him. By adding, to those dispositions, good instructions to the generals of those advanced guards, whether for assigning them the best rallying point as soon as the fatal cordon should be pierced, or for prescribing to them to continue to act in the mountains upon the flanks of the enemy, then <num value="1">one</num> might believe himself invincible, by favor of the <num value="1000">thousand</num> difficulties which the localities present to the assailant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>But when, by the side of such a front of operations, there is found still another nearly like it upon the right, then <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> upon the left; when it is required to defend at the same time all those fronts, under penalty of seeing fall, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approach of the enemy, that <num value="1">one</num> which should be neglected, then the question is changed, the embarrassment of the defender is redoubled in proportion to the extent of the line of defense, and the system of cordons appears with all its dangers, without it being easy to adopt any other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>We could not be better convinced of those truths, than by retracing the position of <persName n="Massena,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00186.00543" reg="mostcommon:Massena,nomatch:0"><surname>Massena</surname></persName> in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 4" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1799--"><year reg="1799">1799</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>There then was the pivot of the defense; but was <placeName key="tgn,7007462" n="1.000 2" reg="schaffhausen,schaffhausen,schweiz,europe">Schaffhausen</placeName> to be left uncovered <pb id="p.187" n="187"/>how were Rheineck and the <rs>St. Gothard</rs> to be abandoned, how open Valais and the access to <placeName reg="Bern, Bern, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007557">Berne</placeName>, without giving up all Helvetia to the coalition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>And if it were wished to cover all even by simple brigades, where would be the army when it should be required to deliver a decisive battle to any hostile mass which might present itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>To concentrate <num value="1">one</num>'s forces in the plain is a natural system, but in regions of difficult gorges it is to deliver up the keys of the country to the enemy, and then it is no longer known upon what point it would be possible to unite an inferior army without compromising it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>A maxim somewhat trite, of which no captain of voltigeurs should be ignorant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Might I not say also, that in this warfare, more than every where else, it is necessary to seek to make it on the communications of the enemy; finally, that in those difficult countries, good temporary bases or lines of defense established at the centre of great confluents, and covered by strategical reserves, will be, with a great mobility and frequent offensive returns, the best means for defending the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>I could not, however, terminate this article, without causing to be observed that mountainous countries are especially favorable for the defensive when the war is truly national, and when the roused populations defend their firesides with the obstinacy which enthusiasm for a holy cause gives; then each step of the assailant is bought at the price of the greatest sacrifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>But, in order that the struggle be crowned with success, it is always necessary that those populations be sustained by a more or less powerful disciplined army, without the support of which, brave inhabitants would soon succumb like the heroes of Stans and of the <name>Tyrol</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>The position of the <name>Swiss</name> and Italians at <placeName reg="Susa, Torino, Piemonte" key="tgn,7005724">Susa</placeName>, engaged in a single valley was not wiser than a cordon, it was even less so, since it shut up the army in a cut-throat place, without guarding the lateral valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>To push light corps into those valleys, to dispute the passes which are there found, and to place the bulk of the army near <placeName key="tgn,7005688" n="1.000 2" reg="torino,torino,piemonte,italia,europe">Turin</placeName> or Carignano, is what strategy counselled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>When the tactical difficulties of a mountain warfare are considered, and the immense advantages which it seems to assure to the defense, we should be tempted to consider as a manoeuvre of the highest temerity, the assembling of a considerable army in a single mass to penetrate by a single valley, and, we should be quite inclined to divide it also into as many columns as there should be practicable passages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>This is, in my opinion, <num value="1">one</num> of the most dangerous of illusions; we have only to recall the fate of the columns of Championnet at the battle of Fossano to be assured of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>The invasion of countries which have not only a mountainous belt, but the interior of which is still a continual series of mountains, is longer and more difficult than that where we can hope an early denouement by a decisive battle delivered in the plains; because fields of battle suitable for deploying great masses scarcely ever being found thereon, such a war is an affair of partial combats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>There it would perhaps be imprudent to penetrate upon a single point by a narrow and deep valley, of which the enemy <pb id="p.190" n="190"/>could close the issues and place the army in a false position; but we could penetrate by wings upon <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> lateral lines, the issues of which should not be at too great distances apart, by combining the marches in such a manner as to debouch at the junction of the valleys nearly at the same instant, and by taking care to repel the enemy from all the counterforts which separate them from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>To give fixed precepts for the complications which are multiplied to infinity by those of the localities, by the resources of art, and by the enthusiasm of the populations and of the armies would be an absurdity; history &mdash; but history well discussed and well presented &mdash; is the true school of mountain warfare.

<head>Article <num value="30">XXX</num> a few words upon great invasions and distant expeditions.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Having already made mention of distant wars and invasions as connected with the policy of States, it remains to us to examine them succinctly under the military aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>We feel some embarrassment in assigning to them their true place in this summary, because if on the <num value="1">one</num> hand they seem to belong to poetry and to Homeric fictions much more than to strategic combinations, it may be said on the other that except the great <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>distances which multiply the difficulties and the unfavorable chances of them, these adventurous expeditions offer nevertheless all the operations which are found in other wars; in fact they have their battles, their combats, their sieges and even their lines of operations; so that they enter more or less into the different branches of the art which make the subject of this work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>However as it is only the question here to consider them as a whole, and as they differ especially from other wars in regard to their lines of operations, we will place them at the end of the chapter which treats of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>There are many kinds of distant expeditions; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> are those executed across the continent as auxiliaries only, and of which we have spoken in Art. <num value="5">5</num>, upon wars of intervention; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> are great continental invasions which have place across vast countries more or less friendly, neutral, doubtful or hostile; the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> are expeditions of the same nature, but executed in part by land and in part by sea with the concurrence of numerous fleets; the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> are expeditions beyond the sea, in order to found, defend or attack distant colonies; the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> are great descents less distant, but attacking great States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>We have already pointed out, in Article <num value="5">5</num>, some of the inconveniences to which auxiliary corps are exposed which are sent to a distance in order to succor powers with which we are connected by defensive treaties or by coalitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Without doubt, under the strategic point of view, a Russian army sent upon the <rs>Rhine</rs> or into <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> in order to act in concert with the <name>Germanic</name> powers, will be in a much stronger and more favorable situation than if it had penetrated to that distance by crossing hostile or even neutral countries; its base, its lines of operations, its eventual points of support will be the same as those of its Allies; it will have a refuge upon their lines of defense, provisions from their magazines, munitions from their arsenals; whilst that in the contrary case it would only find those resources upon the <name>Vistula</name> or the <name>Niemen</name>, and might well experience the fate of those gigantic invasions which have badly succeeded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>However, notwithstanding the capital difference which exists between such an auxiliary war and a distant incursion undertaken in our own interest and with our own means, we could not dissemble the dangers to which those auxiliary corps are exposed, and the embarrassments which the generalissimo especially experiences, when he belongs to the power which plays the auxiliary part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>The campaign of <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct> furnishes a strong proof of this: <persName n="Kutusof,General,,,," id="n0051.0005.00191.00558" reg="mostcommon:Kutusof,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kutusof</surname></persName> advanced upon the <rs type="place">Inn</rs> to the confines of <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>, with <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> Russians; the <orgName>army of <persName n="Mack,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00191.00559" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><surname>Mack</surname></persName></orgName> with which he was to unite, is entirely destroyed, with the exception of <num value="18000">eighteen thousand</num> <pb id="p.192" n="192"/>men which Kienmayer brought back from Donanwerth; the <rs>Russian</rs> general finds himself thus exposed, with less than <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> combattants, to all the impetuous activity of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00192.00560" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> who has a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num>, and in order to crown his misfortune a space of <num value="300">three hundred</num> leagues separates <persName n="Kutusof,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00192.00561" reg="mostcommon:Kutusof,nomatch:0"><surname>Kutusof</surname></persName> from his frontiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>Such a position would have been desperate if a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> army of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men had not arrived at <placeName reg="Olomouc, Severomoravsky, Ceska Republika" key="tgn,7011841">Olmutz</placeName> to receive him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>In truth those last made war as Allies and not as auxiliaries, but even in this last case, political ties are never closely enough drawn not to offer points of dissention which may compromise military operations; we have cited examples, in Article <num value="19">19</num>, upon political objective points.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>Since the invention of gun-powder, there have scarcely been but the incursions of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="8">VIII</genName></persName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, and <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="12">XII</genName></persName>, to Ukraine, which might be counted in the number of remote invasions, for the campaigns of the <name>Spaniards</name> in <persName n="Flanders,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00193.00565" reg="mostcommon:Flanders,nomatch:0"><surname>Flanders</surname></persName> and of the <name>Swedes</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> were of a peculiar nature, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> belonging to civil wars, and the latter having appeared on the scene only as auxiliaries of the protestants.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>As for what concerns <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, he learned to his cost, in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, that it is dangerous to count upon political theories as upon a certain element of success; for if they are proper for raising storms, they could not direct their effect: his liberal homilies, insufficient for unchaining the popular masses, had no other result than to furnish the theorists and declaimers with arms for overthrowing him; for Lanjuinais, <placeName reg="LaFayette, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,2444045">Lafayette</placeName> and their journals, had no less part in his fall than the bayonets of his enemies.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>He will be reproached perhaps for not having done enough to satisfy the popular pretensions; but he had too much experience of men and of affairs to be ignorant, that the unchaining of the political passions always leads to disorder and anarchy, and that doctrines which produce license bring about sooner or later that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1938"/>Starting from this point of view, instead of reproaching him for not having done enough, it might be said with more reason that he did not know how, like <persName n="Richelieu,,Cardinal,,," id="n0051.0005.00194.00571" reg="default:Richelieu,Cardinal,,,"><foreName>Cardinal</foreName> <surname>Richelieu</surname></persName>, to employ in neighboring countries, those dangerous arms the use of which he feared in his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>I do not speak of the fault of having remained at <placeName reg="Moskva, Moskva, Rossiya" key="tgn,7012974">Moscow</placeName> after the conflagration, for then the evil was perhaps beyond remedy, although it would have been less serious if the retreat had been effected at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>In order to condemn or absolve him, it would be very necessary to know the true motives which determined or constrained him to go beyond <placeName reg="Smolenskaya Oblast, Rossiya, Rossiya" key="tgn,7011599">Smolensk</placeName>, instead of halting and of passing the winter there, the project of which he ostentatiously announced; finally it would be necessary to be assured whether it were possible to remain in position between that city and Witepsk, without having previously defeated the <rs>Russian</rs> army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>Far from wishing to set myself up as judge in so great a cause, I acknowledge that those who arrogate to themselves the right so to do are not always equal to such a mission, and want even the information necessary for accomplishing it. That which is most true in the whole affair, is that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00195.00578" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> forgot too much the resentments with which <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Sverige" key="tgn,1000097">Sweden</placeName> were animated against him; he counted too much upon a <hi rend="italics">denouement</hi> between <placeName reg="Wilna, Williams, Ohio" key="tgn,2775221">Wilna</placeName> and the <name>Dwina</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>A just appreciator of the <pb id="p.196" n="196"/>bravery of the <rs>Russian</rs> armies, he was not the same of the national spirit, and of the energy of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Finally, above all, instead of securing to himself the interested and sincere concurrence of a great military power, the adjacent States of which would have procured a sure base for attacking the colossus which he wished to shake, he founded his whole enterprise upon the concurrence of a people brave and enthusiastic, but fickle and devoid of all the elements which constitute a solid power; then, far from turning this ephemeral enthusiasm to the whole account of which it was susceptible, he paralyzed it still by unseasonable concealments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>The fate of all enterprises of this nature attests, in fact, that the capital point for assuring their success, and the only efficacious maxim which, can be given, is, as we have said in Chapter I, Art. <num value="6">6</num>, never to attempt them without the assured and interested concurrence of a respectable power sufficiently near the theatre of operations for offering on the frontier a base suitable, as well for assembling beforehand thereon supplies of every kind, as for procuring a refuge in case of reverse, and new means for retaking the offensive at need.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>With regard to the rules of conduct which should be sought in the precepts of strategy, it would be all the more rash to count upon them, as, without the above mentioned political precaution, the undertaking in itself would be but a flagrant violation of all strategical laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>For the rest, the divers precautions indicated in Articles <num value="21">21</num> and <num value="22">22</num>, for the security of deep lines of operations, and for the formation of intermediate bases are, we repeat, the only military means proper for lessening the dangers of the enterprise; we shall add thereto a just appreciation of distances, of seasons, of countries, in a word, sufficient accuracy in calculations and moderation in victory to know how to stop in time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>Moreover, far from us the thought that it is possible to trace precepts capable of assuring the success of great distant invasions; in the space of <measure n="4000years" type="date">four thousand years</measure> they have made the glory of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> conquerors, and have been a <num value="100">hundred</num> times the scourge of nations and armies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>After having exhausted nearly all that there is essential to say upon those continental invasions, there will remain for us a few remarks to make upon expeditions half continental, half maritime, forming the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> series of those which we have indicated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>These kinds of enterprises have become very rare since the invention of artillery, and the crusades were, I believe, the last example that has been seen of them; perhaps the cause of this must be attributed to the fact that the empire of the <rs type="place">Seas</rs>, after having passed successively into the hands of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> secondary powers, has got into those of an insular <pb id="p.197" n="197"/>power, which possesses many squadrons, but not land forces necessary for those sorts of expeditions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>Be that as it may, from these <num value="2">two</num> causes united, it evidently results that we are no longer in the times when <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00197.00579" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName> marched by land to the conquest of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, by causing himself to be followed by <num value="4000">four thousand</num> vessels of all dimensions, and when <persName><foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> marched from Macedonia by <placeName reg="Turkiye" key="tgn,1000144">Asia Minor</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2072794" n="1.000 2" reg="tyre, seneca, new york">Tyre</placeName>, whilst his fleet coasted along the shore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/>However, if those incursions are no longer made, it is not less certain that the support of a squadron of war and of a fleet of transports would always be an immense succor, when a great continental expedition could be effected in concert with so powerful an auxiliary.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/> 
<p>It will be said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>perhaps, that after having blamed those who wish to base an army upon the sea, I seem to recommend this operation; the question is the means of supplying the intermediate bases which an army would take, and by no means the carrying of <num value="1">one</num>'s military operations upon the coasts.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>Meanwhile it must not be counted upon too exclusively; the winds are capricious; now a squall would suffice for dispersing, and even annihilating that fleet upon which we should have founded all our hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>Successive transports would be less hazardous without being however, an over-certain resource.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>I do not think it necessary to make mention here of invasions executed against a neighboring power, such as those of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00197.00580" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> against <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>; these are ordinary wars, pushed to a greater or less degree, but which have nothing peculiar, and the combinations of which are found sufficiently indicated in the different articles of this work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>The more or less hostile spirit of the populations, the greater or less depth of the line of operations, and the great distance of the principal objective point, are the only variables which many require modifications in an ordinary system of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>Indeed, for being less dangerous than a distant invasion, that which assails an adjacent power has also none the less its fatal chances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>With regard to the part which policy might exercise in those neighboring invasions, if it be true that it <pb id="p.198" n="198"/>is less indispensable than in remote incursions, it is necessary, meanwhile, not to forget the maxim which we have given out in Article <num value="6">6</num>, that there is no enemy, however insignificant he may be, with whom it would not be useful to become allied; the influence which the change of policy of the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Cluses, Haute-Savoie, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7009045">Savoy</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1706--"><year reg="1706">1706</year></dateStruct>, exercised upon the events of that epoch, also the declaration of <persName n="Maurice,,,,," id="n0051.0005.00198.00581" reg="mostcommon:Maurice,nomatch:0"><surname>Maurice</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7003685" n="1.000 11" reg="saxony">Saxony</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1551--"><year reg="1551">1551</year></dateStruct>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, sufficiently proves that it is important to attach to <num value="1">one</num>'s self all the <name>States</name> adjacent to a theatre of war, in a manner to count, if not upon their cooperation, at least upon their strict neutrality.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>Battles are the definitive shock of <num value="2">two</num> armies which are contending for great questions of policy or of strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>Strategy leads armies upon the decisive points of the zone of operations, prepares the chances of battle, and influences in advance its results; but it is for tactics, united to courage, to genius and to fortune, to gain them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>Grand tactics is then the art of well combining and well conducting battles; the directing principle of the combinations of tactics is the same as that of strategy, it is the carrying the weight of our forces upon a part only of the hostile army and upon the point which promises the greatest results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>It has been said that battles were difinitively the principal and decisive action of war; this assertion is not always exact, for we have seen armies destroyed by strategic operations without there having been battles, but only a series of small combats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1996"/>It is true also that a complete and decisive victory may give the same results without there having been grand strategic combinations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1997"/>The results of a battle depend ordinarily upon a union of causes which are not always in the domain of the military art; the kind of order of battle adopted, the wisdom of its measures of execution, the more or less loyal and enlightened concurrence of the lieutenants of the generalissimo, the cause of the struggle, the enthusiasm, the proportions and the quality <pb id="p.202" n="202"/>of the troops, the superiority in artillery or in cavalry, and their good employment, but above all the moral condition of armies and even of nations, are what give victories more or less decisive, and determine their results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>We shall examine successively the divers combinations which they present.

<head>Article <num value="31">XXXI</num>: positions and defensive battles.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>When an army expects a combat, it takes position and forms its line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>It has been seen, by the general definition of operations given at the commencement of this work, that I have made a distinction between lines of battle and orders of battle, objects which have been until this day confounded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2006"/>I shall give the name line of battle to the position deployed, or composed of battalions in columns of attack, which an army will take, in order to occupy a camp and a ground where it may receive combat without a determinate aim, it is the denomination proper for a troop formed according <pb id="p.203" n="203"/>to tactics, upon <num value="1">one</num> or several lines, and which will make the more special object of Article <num value="43">43</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2007"/>I shall call on the contrary, an order of battle that disposition of troops indicating a given manoeeuvre; for example, the parallel order, the oblique order, and the order perpendicular upon the wings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2008"/>This denomination, although new, appears indispensable, in order to designate clearly <num value="2">two</num> objects which it is necessary to guard against confounding.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2009"/> 
<p>It is not the pleasure of innovating which induces me to modify the received denominations for creating new ones; to develop a science, it is important that the same word do not signify <num value="2">two</num> altogether different things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2010"/>If we adhere to naming <hi rend="italics">order of battle</hi>, the simple distribution of troops in the line, then at least the names oblique order of battle, concave order of battle, must not be given to important manoeuvres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2011"/>In this case, it would be necessary to designate these manoeuvres by the systematic terms of oblique battle, &amp;c., but I prefer the denomination I have adopted; the order of battle upon paper could be called plan of organization, and the ordinary formation upon the ground might take the name line of battle.</p></note> From the nature of these <num value="2">two</num> things, we see that the line of battle belongs more particularly to the defensive system, since the army which awaits the enemy, without knowing what he is going to do, truly forms a line of battle vague and without object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2012"/>The order of battle indicating on the contrary, a disposition of troops formed with the intention for combat, and supposing a manoeuvre decided upon in advance, belongs more especially to the offensive order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2013"/>I do not pretend, however, that the line of battle is exclusively defensive, for a troop might very well attack a position in this formation; in the same manner a defensive army might adopt an oblique order, or any other fit for the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>I speak only of the most frequent cases.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>Without following absolutely what is called the system of a war of positions, an army may nevertheless, often await the enemy at an advantageous post, strong by nature, and chosen beforehand for receiving there a defensive battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>We can take such a post when we aim to cover an important objective point, such as a capital, grand depots, or a decisive strategic point which commands the country, finally, when a siege is to be protected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>There are besides several kinds of positions, the strategical, of which we have spoken in Article <num value="20">20</num>, and the tactical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>These last are subdivided in their turn; there are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intrenched positions, selected for awaiting the enemy in a post sheltered, by works more or less connected, in a word, in intrenched camps; we have treated of their relations with strategic operations in Article <num value="27">27</num>, and we shall treat of their attack and defense in Article <num value="36">36</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> are positions strong from their nature, where armies <pb id="p.204" n="204"/>encamp for gaining a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>The last finally are open positions, but chosen beforehand for receiving battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>The qualities which should be sought in these, vary according to the object had in view; it is important in the meanwhile, not to allow ourselves to lean to the prejudice too much in vogue, which causes to be preferred positions steep and difficult of access, very suitable perhaps for a temporary camp, but which are not always the best for delivering battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>Indeed, a position is not strong merely because it is composed of a steep ground, but rather when it is in harmony with the object which we propose in taking it, and when it offers the greatest possible advantages to the kind of troops which constitutes the principal strength of the army; finally, when the obstacles of the ground are more injurious to the enemy than to the army which shall occupy that position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>For example, it is certain that <persName n="Massena,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00204.00591" reg="mostcommon:Massena,nomatch:0"><surname>Massena</surname></persName>, taking the strong position of the <name>Albis</name>, would have committed a grave fault if he had been superior in cavalry and in artillery; whilst, for his excellent infantry, it was exactly what he needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>For the same reason, <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00204.00592" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, whose whole strength consisted in his weight of fire, chose well the position of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName>, all the avenues of which he swept to a distance by a rasant fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>Moreover, the position of the <name>Albis</name> was rather a strategic position, that of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName> a position for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>The maxims which must ordinarily be observed for these last are:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2027"/><num value="1">1</num>. To have outlets more easy for falling upon the enemy when the moment is judged favorable, than the latter would have for approaching the line of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2028"/><num value="2">2</num>. To assure to the artillery all its defensive effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2029"/><num value="3">3</num>. To have a ground advantageous for concealing the movements that might be made, from <num value="1">one</num> wing to the other, with a view of directing masses upon the point judged suitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2030"/><num value="4">4</num>. To be able, on the contrary, to discover easily the movements of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2031"/><num value="5">5</num>. To have an easy retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2032"/><num value="6">6</num>. To have the flanks well supported, in order to render an attack upon the extremities impossible, and to reduce the enemy to an attack upon the centre, or at least upon the front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2033"/>This last condition is difficult to fulfil; for if the army is supported by a river, by mountains or impracticable forests, and experiences the least check, it may be changed into a complete disaster, since the broken line would be thrown back upon those same obstacles which were believed suited to protect it. This incontestable danger authorizes the belief <pb id="p.205" n="205"/>that posts of an easy defense are better, on a day of battle, than insurmountable obstacles, since it suffices to have posts where we can maintain ourselves for a few hours by the aid of simple detachments.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/> 
<p>The park of Hougoumont, the hamlet of la <persName n="Haie,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00205.00593" reg="mostcommon:Haie,nomatch:0"><surname>Haie</surname></persName>-<persName n="Sainte,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00205.00594" reg="mostcommon:Sainte,nomatch:0"><surname>Sainte</surname></persName>, and the stream of Papelotte, presented to <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00205.00595" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName> obstacles more serious than the famous position of <placeName reg="Elchingen, Stuttgart, Baden-Wurttemberg" key="tgn,7017055">Elchingen</placeName>, where he forced the passage of the <rs>Danube</rs> in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, upon the remnant of a burnt bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>The courage of the defenders could, in fact, not have been absolutely equal in the <num value="2">two</num> circumstances; but, apart from this chance, it must be owned that the difficulties of a ground, when they are turned to good account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>need not be insurmountable, in order to baffle any attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>At <placeName reg="Elchingen, Stuttgart, Baden-Wurttemberg" key="tgn,7017055">Elchingen</placeName>, the great elevation and the steepness of the banks, rendering the effect of the fire almost null, was more injurious than useful to the defense.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>A defect of support for the flanks is remedied sometimes by crotchets in rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>This system is dangerous, inasmuch as a crotchet inherent to the line constrains the movements, and the enemy, by placing cannon upon the angle of the <num value="2">two</num> lines, would cause in them great ravages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>A double reserve, disposed in deep order behind the wing which we should wish to secure from insult, seems better to accomplish the object than a crotchet; localities ought to determine the employment of these <num value="2">two</num> means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>We shall give more ample details of them in the <rs n="Battle of Prague" type="battle">battle of Prague</rs>, (Chapter <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> of the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure> War.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/><num value="7">7</num>. It is not only the flanks that we should seek to cover in a defensive position, it often happens that the front offers obstacles upon a part of its development, so as to necessitate the enemy to direct his attacks upon the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>Such a position will always be <num value="1">one</num> of the most advantageous for a defensive army, as the battles of <placeName key="tgn,6003663" n="1.000 1" reg="malplaquet,nord,nord-pas-de-calais,france,europe">Malplaquet</placeName> and <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName> have proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>To attain this object, immense obstacles are not necessary, the least accident of ground sometimes suffices; it was the miserable stream of Papelotte which forced <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00205.00596" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName> to attack the centre of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00205.00597" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, instead of assailing the left as he was ordered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>When such a post is to be defended, it is necessary to render movable a part of the wings thus sheltered, in order that they may participate in the action, instead of remaining idle witnesses thereof.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>It cannot be dissembled, nevertheless, that all these means are but paliatives, and that the best of all for an army which awaits the enemy defensively, is to know how to retake the initiative when the moment has arrived for doing so with success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>We have placed in the number of qualities requisite for a position, that of offering an easy retreat; this leads us to the examination of a question raised by the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>Would an army, backed against a forest, when it should have a good road in rear of the centre and each of <pb id="p.206" n="206"/>the wings, be compromised as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00206.00598" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> has pretended, if it chanced to lose the battle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2049"/>As for myself I believe, on the contrary, that such a position would be more favorable for a retreat than a ground wholly uncovered, for the beaten army could not traverse a plain without being exposed to the greatest danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2050"/>Doubtless, if the retreat should degenerate into a complete rout, a part of the artillery left in battery before the forest would probably be lost, but the infantry, the cavalry and the remainder of the artillery would retire as well as across a plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2051"/>If the retreat, on the contrary, is made in order, nothing could better protect it than a forest; well understood, nevertheless, that there exist at least two good roads behind the line, that <num value="1">one</num> does not allow himself to be pressed too near, without considering upon the measures necessary for the retreat, and that no lateral movement be permitted the enemy in advance of the army at the issue of the forest, as took place at <placeName reg="Hohenlinden, Oberbayern, Bayern" key="tgn,7004654">Hohenlinden</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2052"/>The retreat would be all the more sure if, as was the case at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName>, the forest formed a concave line in the rear of the centre, for this reentrant would become a veritable place of arms for collecting the troops and giving them time to file successively upon the grand route.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2053"/>We have already indicated, in speaking of strategic operations, the divers chances which the <num value="2">two</num> systems, offensive and defensive, procure an army, and we have seen, that in strategy especially, he who took the initiative, had the great advantage of directing his masses, and of striking where he judged agreeable to his interests to do so; whilst he who waits in position, anticipated everywhere, and often taken by surprise, was always forced to subject his movements to those of his adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2054"/>But we have recognized equally that in tactics, those advantages are less positive, because the operations not being upon so vast a circuit, he who has the initiative could not conceal them from the enemy who, discovering him instantly, can, by the aid of good reserves, remedy it upon the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2055"/>Besides that, he who marches upon the enemy, has against him all the disadvantages resulting from obstacles of the ground which he has to overcome, in order to approach the line of his adversary; however flat a country may be, there are always inequalities in the ground, little ravines, small forests, hedges, farm houses, and villages to gain or to pass; add to these natural obstacles, hostile batteries to carry, and the disorder which always introduces itself more or less in a troop long exposed to the fire of artillery or musketry, and we shall be convinced that at least, the advantage of the initiative is balanced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2056"/>However incontestable these truths may be, there is another which rises above them, and which is demonstrated by the greatest events of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2057"/><pb id="p.207" n="207"/>It is that in the long run, every army which awaits the enemy in a fixed post, will end by being forced, whilst that by profiting at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the advantages of the defensive, in order to seize afterwards those which the initiative procures, it may hope for the greatest successes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2058"/>A general who waits for the enemy like an automaton, without taking any other part than that of fighting valiantly, will always succumb when he shall be well attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2059"/>It is not so with a general who awaits with the firm resolution of combining great manoeuvres against his adversary, to the end of retaking the moral advantage which the offensive impulse gives, and the certainty of placing his masses in action upon the most important point, which in the simple defensive never has place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2060"/>In fact, if he who awaits is found in a well chosen post, where his movements may be free, he has the advantage of seeing the enemy arrive; his troops well disposed beforehand according to the ground, and favored by batteries placed in such a manner as to obtain the greatest effect, may make his adversaries pay dear for the ground which separates the <num value="2">two</num> armies; and when the assailant, already shaken by sensible losses, shall be vigorously assailed himself at the moment when he believed himself within reach of victory, it is not probable that the advantage will remain on his side, for the moral effect of such an offensive return on the part of the enemy who was considered beaten,, is calculated to shake the most audacious.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2061"/>A general may then employ with the same success, for battles, the offensive or defensive system; but it is indispensable to this effect:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2062"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<head>Article <num value="32">XXXII</num>: offensive battles, and different orders of battle.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2073"/>We understand by offensive battles those which an army delivers which assails another in its position.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2074"/> 
<p>In all battles there is an attacking party and the party attacked, each battle will then be offensive for the <num value="1">one</num> and defensive for the other</p></note> An army reduced to the strategic defensive often takes the offensive in the attack, as the army which receives the attack can, in the course even of the battle, reseize the initiative and retake the superiority which it procures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2075"/>History is not wanting in a host of examples for each of these different kinds of battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2076"/>As we have already spoken of the last in the preceding Article, and as we have presented there the advantage which may be found in awaiting the attack, we will limit ourselves here to speaking of what concerns the assailants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2077"/>It cannot be concealed that the latter have, in general, the advantage which the superiority of moral confidence procures, and that they know almost always better what they want and what they are doing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2078"/>When it is resolved to assail the enemy, some order of attack should be adopted, and this is what I have thought it my duty to name orders of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>However, it also frequently happens that we have to begin the battle without a settled plan, for the want of knowing exactly the position of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>In both cases it is always necessary to be well impressed beforehand, that there is in each battle <num value="1">one</num> decisive point which procures the victory better than others, by assuring the application of the principles of war, and it is necessary to place ourselves in condition to carry our efforts upon this point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2081"/>The decisive point of a field of battle is determined as we have already said: by the configuration of the ground, by the combination of the localities with the strategic end that any army proposes to itself, finally, by the position of the respective forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2082"/>Let us give an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2083"/>When a hostile wing, is supported upon heights whence it could batter our line in its whole prolongation, the occupation <pb id="p.209" n="209"/>of those heights seems the most advantageous tactical point; but it may happen, nevertheless, that these heights are of a very difficult access, and situated precisely at the least important point relatively to strategic views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2084"/>At the battle of Bautezen, the left of the <name>Allies</name> was supported by the steep mountains of Bohemia, then rather neutral than hostile; it seemed then that, tactically, the side of those mountains would be the decisive point to carry, and it was just the opposite; because that the ground was very favorable there to the defense, that the allied army had only a single line of retreat upon <persName n="Reichenbach,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00209.00601" reg="mostcommon:Reichenbach,nomatch:0"><surname>Reichenbach</surname></persName> and Gorlitz, and that the <rs>French</rs>, by forcing the right in the plain, seized upon this line of retreat, and threw the allied army into the mountains, where it would have lost all its <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> and a great part of its <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi>. This last course offered then more facilities of ground, more immense results, and less obstacles to vanquish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2085"/>From all that precedes, we can, I believe, deduce the following truths: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2086"/>The topographical field of battle is not always the tactical key. <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2087"/>The decisive point of a field of battle is unquestionably that which unites the strategic advantage with the most favorable localities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2088"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2089"/>In the case where there are not too formidable difficulties of ground upon the strategic point of this field of battle, that point is ordinarily the most important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2090"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2091"/>However, it happens also that the determination of this point depends above all upon the position of the respective forces; thus, in lines of battle too extended and cut up, the centre will be always the most essential to attack; in close lines the centre is on the contrary, the strongest point, since independently of the reserves which are found there, it will be easy to cause it to be sustained by the wings; then the decisive point will be on the contrary, upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2092"/>With a great superiority of forces, we may attack the <num value="2">two</num> extremities at the same time, but not with forces equal or inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2093"/>It is seen then that all the combinations of a battle consists in employing our forces in such a manner that they obtain the greatest possible action upon that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> points which offers the most advantages, a point which it will be easy to determine, by submitting it to the analysis which we have just explained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2094"/>The aim of an offensive battle can only be to dislodge and break the enemy, unless by strategic manoeuvres the entire ruin of his army has been prepared; now an enemy is dislodged, either by overthrowing his line upon some point of his front, or by outflanking it, in order to take it in flank or in reverse, or in making the <num value="2">two</num> means concur at the same time, that is to say, by an attack in front at the same time that an acting wing should double and turn the line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2095"/>In order to attain these various ends, it is necessary to choose the order of battle most appropriate to the mode which shall be preferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2096"/><pb id="p.210" n="210"/></p> 
<p>There are counted at least <num value="12">twelve</num> kinds of orders of battle, viz: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2097"/>The simple parallel order; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2098"/>The parallel order with the defensive or offensive crotchet; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2099"/>The order reinforced upon <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> wings; <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2100"/>The order reinforced upon the centre; <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2101"/>The oblique order, either simple or reinforced upon the assailing wing; <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> and <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>The order perpendicular upon <num value="1">one</num> or both wings; <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2103"/>The concave order; <num value="9" type="ordinal">9th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2104"/>The convex order; <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2105"/>The order in echelon upon <num value="1">one</num> or both wings; <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2106"/>The order in echelon upon the centre; <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2107"/>The order combined of a strong attack upon the centre and upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2108"/>(See plate opposite, figures <num value="1">1</num> to <num value="12">12</num>.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2109"/>Each of these orders may be employed simply or be combined, as has been said, with the manoeuvre of a strong column destined to turn the hostile line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2110"/>In order to judge of the merit of each of them, it is necessary to be assured of their relations with the general principles which we have laid down.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2111"/>We see, for example, that the parallel order (<num value="1">No. 1</num>) is the worst; for there is no skill in causing the <num value="2">two</num> parties to fight with equal chances, battalion against battalion; it is the absence of all tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2112"/>There is, nevertheless, an important case in which this order is suitable; it is when an army having taken the initiative of grand strategic operations, shall have succeeded in carrying itself upon the communications of its adversary, and in cutting him off from his line of retreat while covering its own; then when the definitive shock between the armies has place, he who is found upon the rear may deliver a parallel battle, since having made the decisive manoeuvre before the battle, his whole aim consists in repelling the effort of the enemy to open himself a passage; except this case the parallel order is the least advantageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2113"/>Nevertheless, that is not saying that a battle cannot be gained by adopting it, for it is necessary that some <num value="1">one</num> should gain it, and the advantage will remain then to him who shall have the best troops, who shall know best how to engage them at the proper time, who shall manoeuvre best with his reserves, or finally who shall be favored by fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2114"/>The parallel order with a crotchet upon the flank, (fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2115"/><num value="2">2</num>) is taken most ordinarily in a defensive position; it may, however, be also the result of an offensive combination, but then it will be found in advance of the line, whilst in the defensive it is in rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2116"/>There may be seen in the <rs n="Battle of Prague" type="battle">battle of Prague</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary examples of the fate which such a crotchet may experience when it is well attacked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2117"/>The parallel order (<num value="3">No. 3</num>,) reinforced upon <num value="1">one</num> of the wings, or that (<num value="4">No. 4</num>,) reinforced upon the centre, in order to pierce that of the enemy, are much more favorable than the <num value="2">two</num> preceding, and are also much more conformable <pb id="p.211" n="211"/>to the <rs n="General Principle" type="misc">general principle</rs> which we have pointed out, although with an equality of forces, the part of the line which should be weakened, in order to reinforce the other, might also be compromised, if it were placed in battle parallelly to the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2118"/>The oblique order (<num value="5">No. 5</num>,) is that which suits the best an inferior army, which attacks a superior; for, while offering the advantage of carrying the mass of the forces upon a single point of the enemy's line, it procures <num value="2">two</num> others equally important; in fact, we do not only refuse the weakened wing, by keeping it beyond the blows of the enemy, that wing fulfills still the double destination of holding in respect the part of the line which it is not wished to attack, and in the mean time of being able to serve as reserve at need to the acting wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2119"/>This order was employed by the celebrated <rs>Epaminondas</rs> at the battle of <placeName reg="Leuctra">Leuctra</placeName> and Mantinea; but we shall present the most brilliant example of the advantages of this system, which was given by <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> at the <rs n="Battle of Leuthen" type="battle">battle of Leuthen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2120"/>(See Chapter <num value="7">7</num>, Treatise of Grand Operations.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2121"/>The order perpendicular upon <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2122"/>or both wings, such as is presented in figures <num value="6">6</num> and <num value="7">7</num>, should only be considered a theoretical form to indicate the tactical direction upon which we should direct our efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2123"/>Never would <num value="2">two</num> armies be found in positions relatively perpendicular, such as we see them traced on the plate, for if the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> B took in fact its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> direction in a perpendicular line upon <num value="1">one</num> or both of the extremities of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> A, the latter would change immediately the front of a part of its line, and even the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> B, when it should have attained or passed the extremity, would not fail to change the direction of its columns to the right or to the left, in order to approach the enemy's line, so that the part C would take it in reverse, and there would result <num value="2">two</num> true oblique lines like those pointed out in figure <num value="6">6</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2124"/>It must be inferred hence, that a single division of the assailing army should be carried perpendicularly upon the enemy's flank, whilst that the remainder of this army should approach the other extremity, in order to disquiet it, which would lead to <num value="1">one</num> of the oblique dispositions indicated by figures <num value="5">5</num> and <num value="12">12</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2125"/>Besides, the attack upon <num value="2">two</num> wings, whatever form we may give it, may be very advantageous, but it is when the assailant is found very superior in number; for if the fundamental principle consists in carrying the major part of the forces upon the decisive point, an inferior army would violate this principle in forming a double attack against a single superior mass; we shall demonstrate this truth in the course of the work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2126"/>The order, concave upon the centre, (<num value="8">No. 8</num>,) has found partisans, since <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00211.00602" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> owed to it the signal victory of <placeName reg="Canne, Bari, Puglia" key="tgn,7009090">Cannae</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>This order may be, in <pb id="p.212" n="212"/>fact, very good when it is taken in consequence of the events of the battle, that is to say, when the enemy engages in the centre which yields before him, and when he allows himself to be enveloped by the wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>But if this formation is taken before the battle, the enemy, instead of throwing himself upon the centre, would only have to fall upon the wings which would of themselves present their extremities, and would be thus in the same situation as if they were found assailed upon a flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2129"/>Therefore, this position is seldom taken, except against an enemy who should himself be formed in convex order to deliver battle, as will be seen hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>In truth, an army will rarely form a semi-circle, and will rather take a broken line reentrant towards the centre, (like figure <num value="8">8</num> bis.) If we believe several writers, it was such a disposition which caused the <rs>English</rs> to triumph on the celebrated days of <placeName reg="Crecy-en-Ponthieu, Somme, Picardie" key="tgn,7017025">Crecy</placeName> and <placeName reg="Azincourt, Pas-de-Calais, Nord-Pas-de-Calais" key="tgn,7016442">Agincourt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>It is certain that this order is better than a semi-circle, because it does not lend the flank so much, allows the marching in advance by echelon, and preserves with that all the effect of concentration of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>However, its advantages disappear if the enemy, instead of throwing himself madly in the concave centre, confines himself to observing it from a distance, and throw himself with the mass of his forces upon <num value="1">one</num> wing only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2133"/>The battle of <placeName key="tgn,1004446" n="1.000 10" reg="Essling,Wien,Wien,Osterreich,Europe">Essling</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>, offers still an example of the advantage of a concave line; but it cannot be inferred that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00212.00603" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> did badly in attacking its centre; we cannot judge an army fighting with the <rs>Danube</rs> at its back, and not having the power to move without uncovering its bridges, as if it had had full liberty of manoeuvering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2134"/>The convex order salient at the centre, (<num value="9">No. 9</num>,) is taken for fighting immediately after the passage of a river, when we are forced to refuse the wings, in order to rest on the river and cover the bridges, or better still, when we fight defensively, backed against a river, in order to repass it and cover the defile as at Leipsig; finally we can take it naturally, in order to arrest an enemy who forms a concave line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2135"/>If the enemy directed his effort upon the salient, or upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities alone, that order would cause the ruin of the army.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2136"/> 
<p>An attack upon the <num value="2">two</num> extremities might succeed well also in some circumstances, either when <num value="1">one</num> should have sufficient forees to attempt it, or when the enemy should be unable to uncover his centre in order to sustain his wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>But as a general thing, a false attack, in order to hold the centre and a grand effort upon a single extremity, would be especially the most favorable against such a convex line.</p></note> The <rs>French</rs> took it at <placeName key="tgn,7007879" n="1.000 10" reg="Fleurus,Province de Hainaut,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe">Fleurus</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></dateStruct>, and succeeded, because the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Coburg, Oberfranken, Bayern" key="tgn,7004330">Coburg</placeName>, instead of attacking in force the centre, or a single extremity, divided his efforts upon <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> divergent rays, and especially upon the <num value="2">two</num> wings at the <pb id="p.213" n="213"/>same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>It was nearly in the same convex order that they fought at <placeName key="tgn,1004446" n="1.000 10" reg="Essling,Wien,Wien,Osterreich,Europe">Essling</placeName>, as well as on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> days of the famous battle of Leipsig; it had, on the last occasions, the infallible results which it ought to have.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2139"/>The order of echelons upon the <num value="2">two</num> wings (<num value="10">No. 10</num>) is in the same case as the perpendicular order; (<num value="7">No. 7</num>); it must be observed nevertheless that the echelons approaching towards the centre, where would be held the reserve, this order would be better than the perpendicular, since the enemy would have less facility, space and time to throw himself in the interval of the centre and direct there a menacing counter-attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2140"/>The order of echelons upon the centre only (<num value="11">No. 11</num>) might especially be employed with success against an army which should occupy a line broken and too much extended, because his centre being found then isolated from the wings in a manner to be overcome separately, this army, cut thus in <num value="2">two</num>, would probably be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2141"/>But by the application of the same fundamental principle this order of attack would be less certain against an army occupying a compact and united position, for the reserves being found ordinarily within reach of the centre and the wings being able to act either by a concentric fire or by taking the offensive against the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> echelons, could easily repulse them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2142"/>If this formation offers some resemblance to the famous triangular wedge or <hi rend="italics">caput porci</hi> of the ancients and with the column of <persName n="Winkelried,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00213.00604" reg="mostcommon:Winkelried,nomatch:0"><surname>Winkelried</surname></persName>; it differs from them however essentially, because in place of forming a full mass, which would be impracticable in our days on account of the artillery, it would offer on the contrary a great open space in the middle, which would facilitate the movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2143"/>This formation suitable, as has been said, for piercing the centre of a too extended line, could equally succeed against a line which should be condemned to immobility; but if the wings of the line attacked know how to act seasonably against the flanks of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> echelons, it would not be without its inconveniences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2144"/>A parallel order considerably reinforced upon the centre would perhaps be better, (figures <num value="4">4</num> and <num value="12">12</num>) for the parallel line, in this case would have at least the advantage of deceiving the enemy upon the true point of the projected effort and of preventing the wings from taking in flank the echelons of the centre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>This echelon order was adopted by Laudon for the attack of the intrenched <placeName reg="camp of Burzelwitz">camp of Burzelwitz</placeName> (Treatise of Grand Operations Chapter <num value="28">28</num>). In such a case it is really suitable, since we are sure then that the defensive army being forced to remain in its intrenchments, there would be no attack to fear on his part against the flanks of the echelons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2146"/>However <pb id="p.214" n="214"/>this formation having the inconvenience of indicating to the enemy the point of the line which he wishes to attack, it would be indispensable to make upon the wings simultaneous attacks strong enough to mislead the enemy upon the real point where the effort should be directed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2147"/>The order of attack in columns upon the centre and upon <num value="1">one</num> extremity at the same time (<num value="12">No. 12</num>) is more suitable than the preceding, especially when it is applied to a continuous hostile line; it may even be said that of all the orders of battle it is the most rational; in fact the attack upon the centre seconded by a wing that outflanks the enemy, prevents the latter from doing as <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00214.00605" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> and <persName n="Saxe,Marshal,,,," id="n0051.0006.00214.00606" reg="mostcommon:Saxe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Saxe</surname></persName> did; that is to say, from rushing upon the assailant taking him in flank ; the hostile wing which is formed pressed between the attack of the centre and that of the extremity, having almost the whole of the assailing masses to combat,will be overwhelmed and probably destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2148"/>This was the manoeuvre which caused <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00214.00607" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> to triumph at <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName> and at <placeName key="tgn,6003419" n="1.000 10" reg="Ligne,Province de Hainaut,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe">Ligny</placeName>; it was what he wished to attempt at <placeName reg="Borodino, Tverskaya Oblast', Rossiya" key="tgn,7010116">Borodino</placeName> and which only succeeded imperfectly on account of the heroic defense of the troops of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of the <name>Russians</name>, that of the division <persName><foreName>Paskevitch</foreName> <genName>il</genName></persName> the famous redoubt of the centre, then by the arrival of the corps of Baggavout upon the wing which he hoped to outflank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2149"/>Finally he employed it also at Bantzen where he would have obtained unexampled success but for an incident which deranged the manoeuvre of his left destined to cut off the route of Wurschen, and which had already everything disposed for that purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2150"/>We should observe that those different orders could not be taken literally as the geometrical figures indicate them, A general who should wish to establish his line of battle with the same regularity as upon paper, or upon a field of exercise, would unquestionably be deceived in his expectations and beaten, especially after the present method of making war. In the times of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>, and <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>, when armies encamped under tents, almost always united; when <num value="1">one</num> found himself several days face to face with the enemy, when he had leisure to open marches or symmetrical roads in order to cause his columns to arrive at uniform distances; then a line of battle could be formed almost as regular as the figures traced, But now that armies bivouac, that their organization into several corps renders them more moveable, that they approach each other in consequence of orders given out of the visual ray and often without even having had time to reconnoitre exactly the position of the enemy, finally that the different arms are found mingled in the line of battle: then all orders drawn by compass must necessarily be found at fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2151"/>Therefore those kinds of figures have ever served only to indicate an approximate disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/><pb id="p.215" n="215"/></p> 
<p>If armies were compact masses which could be moved in a single body by the effect of a single will and as rapidly as thought, the art of gaining battles would be reduced to choosing the most favorable order of battle, and we might count upon the success of manoeuvres combined previous to the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>But it is quite otherwise: the greatest difficulty in the tactics of battles will ever be to assure the putting in simultaneous action all those numerous fractions which should concur in the attack upon which the hope of victory is founded, or more properly speaking, the execution of the capital manoeuvre which, according to the primitive plan, should bring about success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/>The precise transmission of orders, the manner in which the lieutenants of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> shall conceive and execute them; the too great, energy of some, the laxity or the defective <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> of others; all may hinder that simultaneous action, without speaking of fortuitous accidents which may suspend the arrival of a corps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>From thence result <num value="2">two</num> incontestible truths, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that the more simple a decisive manoeuvre shall be, the more certain will be its success; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is that the seasonableness of sudden dispositions, taken during the combat, is of more probable success than the effect of manoeuvres combined in advance; unless the latter reposing upon interior strategic movements, have led the columns which are to decide the battle, upon points where their effect will be assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>Warterloo and Bautzen attest this last truth; from the moment when <persName n="Bulow,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00215.00608" reg="mostcommon:Bulow,nomatch:0"><surname>Bulow</surname></persName> and <persName n="Blucher,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00215.00609" reg="mostcommon:Blucher,nomatch:0"><surname>Blucher</surname></persName> had arrived upon the height of Frischermont, nothing could have prevented the loss of the battle by the <rs>French</rs>, they could struggle only to render the defeat more or less complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>In the same manner at Bautzen as soon as <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00215.00610" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName> had arrived at Klix, the retreat of the <name>Allies</name> on the night of the <dateStruct value="-05-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, would alone have been able to save them, for on the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> it was no longer time, and if <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00215.00611" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName> had better executed what he was advised, the victory would have been immense.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>With regard to manoeuvres for breaking a line, by counting upon the co-operation of columns departing from the same front as the rest of the army, to the end of operating by great circular movements around a hostile wing, their success is always doubtful, for it depends upon a precision of calculation and of execution which is seldom met with; we shall speak of them in Article <num value="33">33</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>Independently of the difficulty of counting upon the exact application of a premeditated order of battle, it often happens that battles commence without determinate objects, even on the part of the assailant, although the shock was anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/>This uncertainty results either from the precedents <pb id="p.216" n="216"/>of the battle or from want of knowledge of the position of the enemy and of his projects, or finally from the waiting for a portion of the army which might yet be in rear.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>Hence many people have concluded against the possibility of reducing the formations of orders of battle into different systems, and against the influence which the adoption of such or such another of those orders could exercise upon the issue of a combat; a false conclusion, in my opinion, even in the cases before cited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>Indeed, in those battles commenced without a decided plan, it is probable that at the commencement of the action the armies are found in line nearly parallel to each other, more or less reinforced upon <num value="1">one</num> or the other point; the defender ignorant upon what side the storm will burst, will hold a good part of his forces in reserve to guard against events; he who is resolved to attack will do the same at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in order to have his masses disposable; but as soon as the assailant shall have determined the point upon which he shall decide to strike, then his masses will be directed, either upon the centre, or upon <num value="1">one</num> of the wings, or upon both at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>Now, whatever may happen there will ever result approximately <num value="1">one</num> of the dispositions prescribed in the different figures of the preceding plate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>Even in unexpected rencounters the same thing would happen, which will demonstrate, I hope, that this classification of the various systems or orders of battle is neither chimerical nor useless.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2171"/>I think then I can conclude that, if it be absurd to expect to draw upon the ground rectilinear orders of battle such as are traced upon a plan, a skillful general can nevertheless have recourse to dispositions which would produce a distribution of the acting masses, similar very nearly to what it would have been in <num value="1">one</num> or another of the orders of battle indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2172"/>He should apply himself in those dispositions, whether foreseen or unexpected, to judge soundly of the important point of the field of battle, which he will be able to do by comprehending the relations of the hostile line with the decisive strategic directions; he will then direct his attention and efforts upon that point, by employing <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of his forces to hold in check or to observe the enemy, then by throwing the other <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> upon the point the possession of which would be the pledge of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2173"/>Acting thus he will have fulfilled all the conditions that the science of grand tactics can impose upon the most skillful captain; he will have obtained the most perfect application of the principles of the art. We have already indicated in the preceding chapter the means of recognizing easily those decisive points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2174"/>Since I have given the definition of the <num value="10">ten</num> orders of battle above mentioned, the thought has occurred to me to reply to some assertions in the memoirs of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00217.00616" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> published by <persName n="Montholon,General,,,," id="n0051.0006.00217.00617" reg="mostcommon:Montholon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Montholon</surname></persName>, which refer to this subject:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2175"/>The great <rs>Captain</rs> seems to suppose that the oblique order is a modern conception an inapplicable utopia, which I equally deny, for the oblique order is as ancient as <placeName key="tgn,7001297;tgn,2030375" n="0.008 000000.0248	placename;tgn,7001297;thebes,qina,as said,misr,africa,Qina,As Said,Misr,Africa;0.008 000000.0248	placename;tgn,2030375;Thebes, Alexander, Illinois,Alexander,Illinois,United States,North and Central America" reg="thebes,qina,as said,misr,africa,Qina,As Said,Misr,Africa;Thebes, Alexander, Illinois,Alexander,Illinois,United States,North and Central America">Thebes</placeName> and <placeName reg="Old Sparta, Conecuh, Alabama" key="tgn,2557885">Sparta</placeName>, and I have seen it applied under my own eyes; those assertions will appear all the more astonishing that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00217.00618" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, as we have just said, has himself boasted of having applied with success, at <placeName key="tgn,2035190;tgn,2028962" n="0.014 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2035190;marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.011 000000.0992	placename;tgn,2028962;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America" reg="marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America">Marengo</placeName>, this same order the existence of which he denies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2176"/>If we took the oblique system in the absolute sense which <persName n="Ruchel,General,,,," id="n0051.0006.00217.00619" reg="mostcommon:Ruchel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Ruchel</surname></persName> gave to it in the <name>Academy</name> of <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, certainly <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00217.00620" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> would be right in regarding it as an hyperbole: but I repeat, a line of battle was never a perfect geometrical figure; and if we have used such figures in tactical discussions, it was in order to put in force an idea and to explain <pb id="p.218" n="218"/>it by a symbol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2177"/>It is certain nevertheless that every line of battle which should neither be parallel nor perpendicular to that of the enemy, would of necessity be oblique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2178"/>Now if an army attacks an extremity of the enemy, by reinforcing the wing charged with the attack and refusing the enfeebled wing, the direction of its line will be in reality a little oblique, since <num value="1">one</num> extremity will be more removed from the hostile line than the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2179"/>The oblique order is so far from a chimera, that every order in echelons upon a wing will always be oblique (pl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2180"/><num value="2">2</num>, fig. <num value="10">10</num>,) now I have seen more than <num value="1">one</num> combat thus disposed in echelons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2181"/>As for the other figures traced upon the same plate, it could not be contested that at <placeName key="tgn,1004446" n="1.000 10" reg="Essling,Wien,Wien,Osterreich,Europe">Essling</placeName>, as well as at <placeName key="tgn,7007879" n="1.000 10" reg="Fleurus,Province de Hainaut,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe">Fleurus</placeName>, the general disposition of the <name>Austrians</name> was concave, and that of the <rs>French</rs> convex.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2182"/>But those <num value="2">two</num> orders may form parallel lines as well as <num value="2">two</num> right lines: now these orders would be systematically parallel if no part of the line were not more reinforced nor brought nearer to the enemy than another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2183"/>As for the rest, let us leave geometrical figures, and acknowledge that the true scientific theory of battles will always be limited to the following points:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/><num value="1">1</num>. The offensive order of battle should aim to dislodge the enemy from his position by every rational means.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2185"/><num value="2">2</num>. The manoeuvres which the art indicates are to overwhelm a wing only, or else the centre and a wing at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>The enemy may also be dislodged by manoeuvres for outflanking and turning him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2187"/><num value="3">3</num>. We shall succeed all the better in these enterprises if we are able to conceal them from the enemy until the moment of assailing him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/><num value="4">4</num>. To attack the centre and the <num value="2">two</num> wings at the same time, without having very superior forces, would be a total absence of the art, unless we should reinforce considerably <num value="1">one</num> of the attacks, taking care not to compromise the others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2189"/><num value="5">5</num>. The oblique order is nothing else but a disposition tending to unite the half at least of <num value="1">one</num>'s forces in order to overwhelm a wing, holding the other fraction out of the reach of the enemy, either by echelons, or by the inclined direction of the line (figs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2190"/><num value="5">5</num> and <num value="12">12</num>, pl. <num value="2">2</num>).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/><num value="6">6</num>. The divers formations, convex, concave, perpendicular, &amp;c., all present the same combination of attacks parallel or reinforced, upon a portion only of the hostile line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/><num value="7">7</num>. The defense desiring the contrary of the attack, the dispositions of defensive order should have for their object, to multiply the difficulties <pb id="p.219" n="219"/>of the approach, then to provide strong reserves well concealed, in order to fall, at the decisive moment, where the enemy should expect to find but a feeble point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/><num value="8">8</num>. The best mode to employ for constraining a hostile line to quit its position is difficult to determine in an absolute manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2194"/>Every order of battle or of formation which could combine the advantages of fire with those of the impulsion of attack and the moral effect it produces, would be a perfect order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>A skilfull mixture of deployed lines and of columns, acting alternately according to circumstances, will ever be a good system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>As regards its practical application, the <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> of the chief, the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of the officers and soldiers, their instruction in all kinds of manoeuvres and fires, the localities or the nature of the ground, will always have a great influence upon the variables which might present themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/><num value="9">9</num>. The essential object of an offensive battle being to force the enemy from his position, and especially to cut him up as much as possible, it will be our especial duty ordinarily to count upon the employment of material force as the most efficacious means for succeeding in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>It happens however that the chances for the employment of force alone, would be so doubtful, that we would succeed more easily by manoeuvres tending to outflank and to turn that <num value="1">one</num> of the wings which should be nearest to the line of retreat of the enemy, which would decide him to a retrograde movement for fear of being cut off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>History abounds in examples of the success of like movements; especially against generals of a feeble character: and although victories obtained by this means only are less decisive, and the hostile army is never seriously broken up by them, those half-successes suffice to prove that such manoeuvres ought not to be neglected, and that a skilfull general should know how to employ them at the proper time, and especially to combine them as much as possible with attacks by main force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/><num value="10">10</num>. The union of these <num value="2">two</num> means, that is to say, the employment of material force upon the front, seconded by a turning manoeuvre, will give more surely the victory than if we limited ourselves to employing them separately; but in both cases it is necessary to guard against movements too disconnected, in the face of the least respectable enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/><num value="11">11</num>. The various means of carrying a hostile position, that is to say of breaking its line and compelling it to retreat by the use of material force are, to shake it at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by the effect of a superior artillery fire, to introduce into it some confusion by a well directed and timely cavalry charge, <pb id="p.220" n="220"/>then to approach finally this line thus shaken, with masses of infantry preceded by skirmishers and flanked by a few squadrons.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>In the meanwhile admitting the success of an attack so well combined against the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, it will remain yet to conquer the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and even the reserve: now it is here that the embarrassment of the attack would be more serious, if the moral effect of the defeat of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line did not often carry with it the defeat of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and did not cause the general attacked to lose his presence of mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>In fact, in spite of their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> success, the assailing troops would also be a little disunited on their side; it will often be very difficult to replace them by those of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, not only because the latter do not always follow the march of the acting masses under the fire of musketry, but above all because it is ever embarrassing to replace <num value="1">one</num> division by another in midst of a combat, and at the instant when the enemy might combine his greatest efforts to repel the attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>Everything then induces the belief that, if the troops and the general of the defensive army did equally well their duty and displayed equal presence of mind, if they were not menaced on their flanks and their line of retreat, the advantage of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> shock would almost always be on their side: but for that purpose it is necessary to seize, with a sure and rapid <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> the instant when it is proper to throw the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line and the cavalry upon the victorious battalions of the adversary, for a few minutes lost may become irreparable, to such a degree that the troops of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line would be carried away with those of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</p>

<head>Article <num value="33">XXXIII</num>: turning manoeuvres, and too extended movements in battles.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>We have spoken, in the preceding article, of manoeuvres undertaken for turning the enemy in the day of battle, and of the advantage that might be expected from it. It remains for us to say a few words upon the too extended movements to which those manoeuvres often give place, and which have caused the failure of so many projects in appearance well concerted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>In principle, every movement sufficiently extended to give the enemy time to beat separately half of the army whilst it is being operated, is a loose and dangerous movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>In the meanwhile as the danger which may result from it depends upon the rapid and sure <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> of the adversary, as well as upon his habitual system of warfare, it is easily comprehended why so many similar manoeuvres have failed against some, and succeeded against others, and why such a movement which would have been too extended before <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00222.00623" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> or <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00222.00624" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, has had entire success against mediocre generals, wanting tact to take the initiative or habituated themselves to disconnected movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>It appears very difficult to trace an absolute rule of conduct, there exists no other than that <quote>of holding the weight of our forces in hand in order to cause them to act at the opportune moment, but without falling into the contrary excess of too much accumulating them: we shall be sure then of always being in condition to meet events.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>But I am carried away by my subject, and it is necessary to return to the measures most suitable for an attack against lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>If these are of a relief sufficiently strong to render their assault dangerous, and if on the contrary there are means for outflanking or turning them by strategic manoeuvres, this course would ever be more suitable than a doubtful attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>In the contrary case, and if you have some motive for preferring this, a point upon <num value="1">one</num> of the wings would be necessary, because it is natural enough that the centre is more easy to sustain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>However it has been seen, that an attack upon a wing being regarded with reason by the defender as the most probable, you might succeed in deceiving him by directing a somewhat strong false attack upon that side, whilst that the true, made upon the centre would succeed precisely because it was not probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>In these kinds of combinations, the localities and the spirit of the generals ought to decide as to the best mode to follow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>Moreover, as regards the execution of the attack, we can scarcely employ other means than those recommended for intrenched camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>Meanwhile as these lines, heretofore at least, often had the relief and propor, tions of permanent works, it may happen that their escalade be difficultexcept for earthen works already rather old, the slopes of which might be the worse for time and accessible to a somewhat dexterous infantry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>Such were, as we have already said, the ramparts of Ismaiel and of <placeName key="tgn,7006464" n="1.000 1" reg="praha,stredocesky,ceska republika,europe">Prague</placeName>; such was also the citadel of <placeName reg="Smolenskaya Oblast, Rossiya, Rossiya" key="tgn,7011599">Smolensk</placeName> which <persName n="Paskevitch,General,,,," id="n0051.0006.00232.00654" reg="mostcommon:Paskevitch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Paskevitch</surname></persName> defended with so much glory against <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0006.00232.00655" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName>, because he preferred to defend the ravines which were in front of it rather than take refuge behind a parapet scarcely <num value="30">30</num> degrees inclined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>If a line is supported by a river, it seems absurd to think, even, of penetrating upon that wing, because the enemy, collecting his forces, the weight <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>of which would be near the centre, could overturn the columns which should advance thus between them and the river, in such a manner that their total loss would be certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>Meanwhile this absurdity has been seen to succeed, because the enemy, forced behind his lines, rarely thinks of an offensive return, however advantageous it may appear; for a general and soldiers who seek a refuge in lines are already half conquered, and the idea of taking the offensive does not happen to them when their intrenchments are found already invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>However, it would be impossible to counsel the trial of such a manoeuvre; the general who should expose himself by it, and who should experience the fate of Tallard at Hochestaedt, could not complain of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>Considering the defense of intrenched camps and of lines, there are not many maxims to give: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is unquestionably to assure <num value="1">one</num>'s self <num value="2">two</num> good reserves, placed between the centre and each of the wings, or, more properly speaking, upon the right of the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, and upon the left of the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>By this means, you can run to the succor of the point which should be forced with all the promptitude possible, which a single central reserve would not permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>It has been thought even that <num value="3">three</num> reserves would not be too many, if the intrenchment were very extended; as for myself, I should incline for having but <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>A recommendation not less essential, is to thoroughly impress the troops with the idea that an affair would not be desperate because the line should be found crossed upon a point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>If you have good reserves which take the initiative seasonably, you will be none the less victorious, by preserving your presence of mind in order to engage them well at the suitable point and moment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>The troops which shall defend the ditch and the parapet will conform to instructions given by the engineers according to the usages practiced in sieges; however, it must be acknowledged, a good work upon the details of the infantry service in sieges and intrenched camps, which may be within the reach of the officers of that arm, is a work yet to make; such an enterprise has nothing in common with this treatise, for it should be the object of a regulation and not of a dogmatic book. </p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>It cannot, however, be dissembled that this is <num value="1">one</num> of the most delicate situations for a general-in-chief; for, if he divides his army in order to cover his bridges, he may with <num value="1">one</num> of these fractions encounter the bulk of the enemy's masses, which would overwhelm it; if he unites his forces upon a single direction, and the enemy deceive him as to the point of his assembling, he might be exposed to see his bridges carried or destroyed, and to find himself compromised before having had time to gain a victory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>The most sure remedies will be to place his bridges near a city which can rapidly be put in condition to protect their defence, then to give his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> operations all the vigor and rapidity possible by throwing himself successively upon the fractions of the hostile army, and punish them in such a manner as to remove from them the desire of troubling the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>In some cases we can add to those means the system of eccentric lines of operations; if the enemy has divided his <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men into several corps, spread in a position of observation, and we move with an equal mass upon a single point in the vicinity of the centre of this cordon, the hostile corps which should find itself isolated at the centre, being quickly overthrown, we could then without risk form <num value="2">two</num> masses of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men, which, by taking a divergent direction, would surely disperse the isolated hostile fractions in an exterior direction, prevent them henceforward from re-uniting, and would remove them thus farther and farther from the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2403"/>But if the passage were effected, on the contrary, upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities of the strategic front of the euemy by changing direction <pb id="p.241" n="241"/>briskly upon that front which would be attacked in its whole extent, as <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> attacked the <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> line tactically at <placeName key="tgn,6003395" n="1.000 10" reg="Leuthen,Dolnoslaskie,Polska,Europe">Leuthen</placeName> in all its length, the army would have its bridges behind it, and would cover them in all its forward movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>The generalissimo could adopt this system Or that explained above for central masses at the moment of the passage, then afterwards excentric, according to the situation of the frontiers and of the bases, finally according to the positions of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>These combinations, of which we have already said something in the article on lines of operations, have not appeared to me misplaced in this, since their relations with the position of bridges makes the principal point of the discussion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>It happens at times that superior reasons determine the attempt of a double passage upon the extent of the same front of operations, as occurred to <persName n="Jourdan,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00241.00676" reg="mostcommon:Jourdan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jourdan</surname></persName> and to <persName n="Moreau,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00241.00677" reg="mostcommon:Moreau,nomatch:0"><surname>Moreau</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2411"/>All that can be recommended upon the subject is to diminish the inconveniences of the double passage, by directing the weight of the forces at least upon that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> points which should then be decisive, then to bring the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> towards each other as soon as possible in an interior direction, to prevent the enemy from overwhelming them separately.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2415"/>Of all the operations of war, retreats are incontestably the most difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>It is so true that the celebrated <persName n="Ligne,Prince,,,,de" id="n0051.0007.00242.00680" reg="mostcommon:Ligne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Ligne</surname></persName> said, with his accustomed spirit, that he did not see how an army succeeded in retiring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>When we reflect, indeed, upon the physical and moral condition in which an army finds itself when it fights retreating, in consequence of a lost battle, upon the difficulty of maintaining order in it, upon the disastrous chances which the least disorder may lead to, we comprehend why the most experienced generals have so much difficulty in resolving upon it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2418"/>What system is to be advised for a retreat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2419"/>Is it necessary to combat desperately until the approach of night, to be able to execute it by favor of the darkness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2420"/>Is it better not to wait until the last extremity, and to quit the field of battle when we can yet do it with a good countenance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2421"/>Ought we to take, by a forced night march, the greatest possible start of the enemy, or rather to halt in good order at <num value="0.5">a half</num> march, making a show of accepting anew the combat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2422"/>Each of these modes, suitable in certain cases, might in others cause the total ruin of the army, and if the theory of war is impotent in some respects, it is certainly in that which relates to retreats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2423"/>If you wish to fight desperately until night, you may expose yourself to a complete defeat before this night has arrived; and then, if a forced retreat were to be made at the moment when darkness begins to envelope everything in its veil, how are you to prevent the decomposition of the army which no longer knows nor sees what it does?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2424"/>If, on the contrary, we quit the field of battle in open day, and without awaiting the last extremity, we may expose ourselves to losing the game at the moment when the enemy himself might renounce the continuance of his attacks, which might cause the troops, ever disposed to blame those prudent chiefs who fight in retreat before being evidently constrained to it, to lose all confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2425"/>Moreover, who could guarantee that a retreat, executed in open day, before a somewhat enterprising enemy, may not degenerate into a rout?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2426"/><pb id="p.243" n="243"/></p> 
<p>When the retreat is finally commenced, it is not less embarrassing to decide whether it is necessary to force a march for gaining all the start possible, since this precipitation may accomplish the loss or safety of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2427"/>All that it is possible to affirm upon this subject, is that, with a considerable army, it is better to make, in general, a slow retreat, with short marches and in good echelon order; because, then <num value="1">one</num> has the means of forming rear guards sufficiently numerous for maintaining themselves a part of the day against the heads of the hostile columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2428"/>We shall return for the rest to these rules:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>Retreats are of divers kinds, according to the motive which determines them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2430"/>You retreat voluntarily before having fought, in order to lead the enemy upon a point less advantageous for him than that where he is found; it is a prudent manoeuvre rather than a retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2431"/>It was thus that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00243.00681" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> retired, in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, from Wischan upon <persName n="Brunn,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00243.00682" reg="mostcommon:Brunn,nomatch:0"><surname>Brunn</surname></persName>, in order to lead the allies upon the point which suited him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2432"/>Finally, it was what I proposed to do before the attack of <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName>, when we had been in formed of the arrival of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00243.00684" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2433"/>I represented the necesssity of a march upon Dippodiswalde for choosing an advantageous field of battle, this idea was confounded with a retreat, and a chivalrous point of honor prevented a retrograde movement without fighting, which would neverthe less have avoided the catastrophe of the following day, (<dateStruct value="1813-08-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> <month reg="08">Aug.</month>, <year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2434"/>You retire also without being defeated in order to fly to a point menaced by the enemy, whether upon the flanks, or upon the line of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2435"/>When you march far from your depots, in an exhausted country, you may be obliged to decamp in order to draw near to your magazines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2436"/>Finally, you retire by compulsion after a lost battle, or at the end of an unsuccessful enterprise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2437"/>These different causes are not the only ones which modify the combina tions of retreats, they vary according to the nature of the country, the distances to be passed over, and the obstacles which the enemy may oppose to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2438"/>They are especially dangerous when they are made in hostile countries; the farther the point of departure is removed from the frontiers, and from the base of operations, the more painful and difficult is the retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2439"/>From the famous retreat of the <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>, so justly celebrated, until the catastrophe which overwhelmed the <rs>French</rs> army in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, history does not offer a great abundance of remarkable retreats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>Moreover it is <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult branches of logistics to know how to combine well the starting and the halts of troops; in retreats especially it is a capital point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>Many generals neglect to regulate the mode and time of halts, which is the cause of numberless disorders, in marches; each division or brigade believing itself able to halt when its soldiers are a little fatigued, or find an agreeable bivouac.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>The more considerable the army, the more compactly it marches, the more important it is to regulate well the departures and halts, especially when night marches are decided upon.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>It is possible that I am indeed deceived as to his intention; in that case my criticism would fall of itself, since I have strongly approved those kinds of retreats which I have, in truth, named parallel retreats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>In fact, it seems to me that an army, quitting the convergent line which leads from the circle of the frontiers to the centre of the <rs>State</rs>, in order to direct itself to the right or to the left, would march rather in the direction nearly parallel with its frontiers, or with its front of operations aid its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>Hence it seems also more rational to give the name parallel retreats, to those which follow this latter direction, leaving the name excentric retreats for those which should depart from the front of operations in divergent directions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>However it may be concerning this dispute of words, for which the obscurity of the text of <persName n="Bulow,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00247.00695" reg="mostcommon:Bulow,nomatch:0"><surname>Bulow</surname></persName> might be the only cause, I intend only to censure the divergent retreats, executed upon several radii, under the pretext <pb id="p.248" n="248"/>of covering a greater extent of frontiers, and of menacing the enemy upon both of his flanks.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>We cannot add anything to what we have just said of retreats, as connected with grand combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/>It remains for us to point out the tactical measures which may facilitate their execution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/><num value="1">One</num> of the surest means of well executing a retreat is to familiarize the officers and soldiers with the idea that from whatever side the enemy may come, they run no more risk in fighting him by the rear than by the front, and to persuade them that the maintenance of order is the only means of saving a troop harrassed in a retrograde march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>It is especially on those occasions that we can appreciate the advantages of a strong discipline which will ever be the best guaranty of the maintenance of order; but to <pb id="p.252" n="252"/>exact discipline it is necessary to assure subsistence, in order to prevent the troops dispersing for marauding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>It is well to place with the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> a chief gifted with a grea <hi rend="italics">sangfroid</hi>, and officers of the staff who could reconnoitre in advance the favorable points where the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> might make a stand in order to suspend the march of the enemy, to the end of placing there the reserve of the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> with artillery.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/> 
<p>The qualities which distinguish a good general of a <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> are not common, especially in southern armies.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>The cavalry being able to rally rapidly on the main body, it will be comprehended that good masses of this arm facilitate much a slow and methodical retreat and give also the means of well scouting and flanking the route in order to prevent the enemy coming unawares to disturb the march of the columns and cut off a part of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>It suffices generally that the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> hold the enemy at <num value="0.5">a half</num> march from the main body; to expose it further off would be hazardous and useless; nevertheless when it shall have defiles behind it, and when they shall be well guarded by its troops it will be able to prolong a little its sphere of operations and remain a march from the army, for defiles equally facilitate a retreat when <num value="1">one</num> is master of them, as they render it difficult when the enemy has seized them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>If the army be very numerous and the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> strong in proportion, then it may well remain a march in rear; that depends on its strength, the nature of the country, and on the enemy with whom we have to do. If the latter becomes too pressing, it would be important not to allow ourselves to be crowded too close, especially if the army were yet in tolerably good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>It is proper in this case to halt from time to time and to fall unexpectedly upon the advanced guards of the enemy, as the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0007.00252.00708" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> did in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct> at <placeName key="tgn,7012926" n="1.000 10" reg="Neresheim,Stuttgart,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Neresheim</placeName>, <persName n="Moreau,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00252.00709" reg="mostcommon:Moreau,nomatch:0"><surname>Moreau</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013234" n="1.000 10" reg="Biberach,Freiburg,Baden-Wurttemberg,Deutschland,Europe">Biberach</placeName> and Kleber at Ukerath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/>Such a manoeuvre almost always succeeds by the surprise which this offensive return causes in a troop which expects only to gather easy trophies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>Passages of rivers in retreat also offer combinations which are not without interest: if it be a small stream with permanent bridges, it is only a passage of an ordinary defile; but if it be a river which has to be crossed upon bridges of boats, it is a more delicate manoeuvre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>All the precautions which can be prescribed, are limited to causing the parks to be taken <pb id="p.253" n="253"/>in advance in order not to be encumbered with them; this measure sufficiently indicates the propriety of the army halting at <num value="0.5">a half</num> march at least from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>In this case, it will be well also that the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> be held a little farther distant from the main body than usual, as far as the localities of the country and the respective forces would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>By this means the army will have time to defile without being too closely pressed; it will be necessary only to combine the march of the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> in such a manner that it be in position in advance of the bridges, when the last troops of the main body shall effect their passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>This decisive moment will appear without doubt suitable for relieving the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> by a fresh corps, which should be disposed beforehand upon well reconnoitered ground; then the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> will traverse the intervals of this corps, in order to pass the river before it; and the enemy astonished at finding troops fresh and disposed to receive him well, will not attempt to press them: the night will thus be gained without check, and the new <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> will be able in turn, to pass and to break the bridges.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>It is understood that the troops, as they have passed, should form at the issues of the bridges, and post their batteries in such a manner as to protect the corps left to hold out against the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>The dangers of such a passage in retreat, and the nature of the precautions which may facilitate it, sufficiently indicate that the best mode of favoring it would be to take in advance <num value="1">one</num>'s measures for constructing an intrenched tete-de-pont upon the point where the bridges will have been thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>In the case where time would not permit the construction of a regular <num value="1">one</num>, they will be able to supply it by a few redouts well armed, which will be of great utility for protecting the retreat of the last troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>If the passage of a great river offers so many delicate chances when <num value="1">one</num> is followed in rear by the enemy, it is an affair much more difficult still when the army finds itself assailed at the same time in front and rear, and the river to be crossed is guarded by an imposing corps.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>Not to allow ourselves to be pressed too closely, to deceive the enemy as to the point of passage, to burst upon the corps which bars our retreat, before that which follows in rear can rally to its assistance, are the only precepts to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>When the army is more numerous, the difficulty is increased; it is true, however, that, if the extent of quarters is augmented in proportion to the numerical force, it must be owned also that the means of resistance to oppose to a hostile irruption is increased in the same progression: the essential point is to be able to unite <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> men in <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.256" n="256"/>and <measure n="20hours" type="date">twenty hours</measure>; with this force, and the certainty of seeing it augmented still, continually, we may resist until the assembling of the army, however numerous it may be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>In spite of that, it must be admitted that it will ever be a delicate affair to canton when the enemy, remaining united, should wish to obstruct it, and hence it should be concluded that the only sure means for the repose of an army during winter, or in the midst of a campaign, is to have its quarters secured by a river or an armistice.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>Since the invention of artillery, and the changes which it has necessarily produced in the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>, transport vessels are too subordinate to colossal <num value="3">three</num> deckers, armed with a <num value="100">hundred</num> thunderbolts of war, to be able to effect descents without the assistance of a numerous fleet of men-of-war, which keep the sea at least until the moment of debarkation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>Before this invention, vessels of transport were at the same time vessels of war; they moved at need by the oar, were light, and could run along the coasts; their number was proportioned to the troops to be embarked, and apart from the chance of tempests, we could almost combine the operations of a fleet like those of an army.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>Meanwhile, we have been on the point of seeing resolved in our day this immense problem of <hi rend="italics">grand descents</hi>, if it be true that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00257.00723" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> ever really entertained the serious project of transporting his <num value="160000">hundred and sixty thousand</num> veterans from <placeName key="tgn,7016632" n="1.000 3" reg="boulogne-sur-mer,pas-de-calais,nord-pas-de-calais,france,europe">Boulogne</placeName> into the bosom of the <placeName reg="British Isles" key="tgn,1009896">British Islands</placeName>; unfortunately, the non-execution of that colossal project has left an impenetrable veil over this grave question.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>At least will our posterity find, in the preparations which were made for this descent, <num value="1">one</num> of the most important lessons which this memorable age has furnished for the study of military men and statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>The labors of every kind performed on the coasts of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> from <dateStruct value="1803--"><year reg="1803">1803</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, will be <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary monuments of the activity, foresight and skill of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0007.00258.00724" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>; they cannot be too highly commended for the study of young military men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>What means are there of moving such a multitude of small vessels, even for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> and <num value="2">two</num> nights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>Besides that, the artillery, the munitions of war, equipments, provisions, the fresh water necessary to be embarked with this multitude of men, require an immense preparation and equipage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>Experience has demonstrated the difficulties of a distant expedition, even for a corps which does not exceed <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men. Hence it is evident that a descent can be effected with such a force only in <num value="4">four</num> hypotheses:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>Against colonies, or isolated possessions;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>Against powers of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rank, which could not be immediately sustained</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>In order to effect a temporary diversion, or to seize a post, the occupation of which for a given time would have a high importance;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>For a diversion, at the same time political and military, against a State already engaged in a great war, and whose troops should be employed far from the point.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>These kinds of operations are difficult to subject to rules: to deceive the enemy as to the point of debarkation; to choose an anchorage where it can be done simultaneously; to exercise all the activity possible, and to seize promptly upon a point of support in order to protect the successive development of the troops; to land immediately the artillery, to give assurance and protection to the troops disembarked; this is nearly everything which can be recommended to the assailant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>The great difficulty of such an operation arises from the fact that the transport vessels never being able to approach the shore, it is necessary to place the troops on the few shallops which follow the fleet, so that the descent is long and successive, which gives the enemy great advantages, <pb id="p.259" n="259"/>however little he may be prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>If the sea be the least rough, the fate of the disembarking troops will be much hazarded; for what can infantry do, huddled in the shallops, battered by the waves, generally tried by sea sickness, and nearly out of condition to use their arms?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>With regard to the defender, he can only be advised not to divide his forces too much in order to cover everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>It is impossible to furnish all the shores of a country with coast batteries, and with battalions to defend them; but it is necessary, at least, to cover the approaches to those points where there are great establishments to protect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>It is necessary to have signals in order to know promptly the point of debarkation, and to unite, if it be possible, all our means before the enemy has taken solid footing with all his.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>The configuration of the coast will as much influence upon the descent as upon the defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>There are countries where coasts are steep, and offer few points accessible at the same time to vessels and to the troops which it is the question to land; then those known points, being few in number, are more easy to watch, and the enterprise on that account becomes more difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>Finally, descents offer a strategic combination which it is useful to point out. It is, that the principle which forbids a continental army to direct its principal forces between the sea and the hostile army, requires, on the contrary, that the army which operates a descent, preserve always its principal force in communication with the shore, which is at the same time its line of retreat and base of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>For the same reason his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> care should be to assure himself of a fortified port, or, at least, of a tongue of land easy to intrench, and in reach of a good anchorage, so that, in case of reverse, the re-embarkation can be made without too much precipitation and loss. </p></div2></div1>

<head>Article <num value="41">XLI</num>: a few words upon logistics in general.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>Is logistics merely a science of detail, or is it on the contrary a general science, forming <num value="1">one</num> of the most essential parts of the art of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>or finally might it be only an expression consecrated by use, to designate vaguely the different branches of the staff service, that is to say, the divers means of applying the speculative combinations of the art, to effective operations?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/>These questions will appear singular to those who are in the firm persuasion that there is nothing more to say upon war, and that it is wrong to seek new definitions when all seems to them so well defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>As for myself, who am persuaded that good definitions lead to clear conceptions, I own that I am almost embarassed to resolve those questions in appearance so simple.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> editions of this work, I have, after the example of many <pb id="p.261" n="261"/>military men, ranged logistics in the class of details of execution of the staff service, which make the object of the regulations of the field service, and of a few special instructions upon the corps of quarter masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>This opinion was the result of prejudices consecrated by time; the word logistics is derived, as we know, from that of <hi rend="italics">major general des logis</hi>, (translated in German by that of <hi rend="italics">Quartiermeister</hi>,) a kind of officers whose functions were formerly to lodge or encamp the troops, to direct the columns, and to place them upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>This was the limit of logistics which, as we see, embraced nevertheless ordinary castrametation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>But after the new manner of making war without camps, movements were more complicated, and the staff had also more extensive attributes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>The chief of the staff was charged with transmitting the thoughts of the generalissimo upon the farthest removed points of the theatre of war, to procure him all the documents for basing his operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>Associated in his combinations, called upon to transmit them, to explain them, and even to watch over their execution as a whole, as well as of their least details, his functions extend necessarily to all the operations of a campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>From that time, the science of a chief of staff was to embrace also the different parts of the art of war, and if it be this which is designated under the name of logistics, the <num value="2">two</num> works of the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0008.00261.00726" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName>, the voluminous treatise of <persName n="Guibert,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00261.00727" reg="mostcommon:Guibert,nomatch:0"><surname>Guibert</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Laroche,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00261.00728" reg="mostcommon:Laroche,M.,,,:1"><surname>Laroche</surname></persName>-Aymon, Bousmard, and of the <rs>Marquis de Ternay</rs>, would scarcely suffice to sketch the incomplete course of such a <hi rend="italics">logistique</hi>, for it would be nothing less than the science of the application of all the military sciences.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>From what precedes, it seems to result naturally that the ancient logistics could no longer suffice to designate the science of the staff, and that the present functions of this corps would still require to be reduced to form, partly into a body of doctrines, partly into regulating dispositions, if it were wished to give it any instruction which should fully respond to its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>It would be for governments to take the initiative, by publishing well considered regulations, which, after having traced all the duties and the attributes of the chiefs and officers of the staff, would be followed by clear and precise instructions for tracing for them also the methods most proper for fulfilling those duties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>The <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> staff had formerly such regulating instructions ; but somewhat superanuated, it was found more appropriate to the old methods than to the new system.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>This work is for the rest, the only <num value="1">one</num> of that kind which has reached me; I do not doubt that there exist others, either published, or secret; but I frankly own my ignorance upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>A few generals, like <pb id="p.262" n="262"/>Grimoard and Thieubaut, have brought to light staff manuels; the new royal corps of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> has caused to be printed several partial instructions, but a satisfactory whole exists yet nowhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>I believe that <persName n="Boutourlin,General,,,," id="n0051.0008.00262.00729" reg="mostcommon:Boutourlin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Boutourlin</surname></persName> has the project of publishing soon an instruction addressed to his officers when he was quarter-master general, and we can only wish that it be realized without delay, for it cannot fail to throw much light upon this interesting subject, upon which there yet remains much to say.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>If it be acknowledged that the ancient logistics was only a science of details for regulating every-thing material in regard to marches; if it be asserted that the functions of the staff embrace at this day the most elevated functions of strategy, it must be admitted also that logistics is no longer merely a part of the science of the staff, or rather that it is necessary to give it another development, and to make of it a new science, which will not only be that of the staff, but that of generals-in-chief.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>If the campaign be opened in the neighborhood of great rivers, it will be necessary to prepare beforehand gun boats and flying bridges, to cause to be collected all the means of embarkations on the points and at the bank where it is desired to use them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>The staff will indicate all the routes which will be necessary to lead the different corps of the army upon the points of assembling, applying themselves especially to directing the marches in such a manner as to do nothing to warn the enemy relative to the enterprises that it should be designed to form.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2685"/><num value="2">2</num>. An essential part of logistics is, without contradiction, that which concerns the drawing up of dispositions for marches or attacks, resolved upon by the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, and transmitted by the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2686"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quality of a general, after that of knowing how to form good plans, will, unquestionably be to facilitate the execution of his orders by the lucid manner in which they shall be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2688"/><pb id="p.266" n="266"/></p> 
<p>I myself have seen employed <num value="2">two</num> quite opposite systems for this important branch of the service; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, which may be called the <orgName n="Old School" type="school">old school</orgName>, consists in giving every day, for the movements of the army, general dispositions filled with minute and, in some instances, scholastic details, all the more misplaced, as they are ordinarily addressed to chiefs of corps sufficiently experienced not to be conducted in leading strings, like sub-lieutenants just from school.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>The other system is that of the isolated orders given by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00266.00733" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> to his marshals, prescribing to each what concerned him particularly, and limiting himself at most to giving them a knowledge of the corps destined to operate in common with them, either to the right or to the left, but never tracing for them the ensemble of the operations of the whole army.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/> 
<p>I think that at the passage of the <rs>Danube</rs> before <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName>, and at the beginning of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> campaign of <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00266.00734" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> deviated from his custom by sketching a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs>.</p></note> I have had reason to be convinced that he acted thus systematically, either for covering the <hi rend="italics">ensemble</hi> of his combinations by a mysterious veil, or from the fear that orders more general happening to fall into the hands of the enemy would aid the latter to defeat his projects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>Doubtless it is very advantageous to keep <num value="1">one</num>'s enterprises secret, and <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs> said with reason that if his night-cap knew what he had in his head, he would throw it into the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>This secresy might be practicable in times when <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> encamped with all his army lying around him; but upon the scale on which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00266.00735" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> manoeuvred, and with the present mode of making war, what harmony could be expected on the part of generals who should be absolutely ignorant of what passes around them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>Of these <num value="2">two</num> systems, the last appears to me preferable; however, a medium might be adopted between the laconism often carried to excess by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00266.00736" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and the minute verbiage which prescribed to experienced generals such as <persName n="Barclay,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00266.00737" reg="mostcommon:Barclay,nomatch:0"><surname>Barclay</surname></persName>, Kleist and Wittgenstein, the manner in which they should break by platoons, and reform on arriving at their positions; a puerility all the more lamentable that it became impracticable in the face of the enemy.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/> 
<p>I shall be repreached, perhaps, for interdicting here to chiefs of the <rs n="General Staff" type="misc">general staff</rs>, those same details which I place above in the number of their important duties; which would be unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>Those details are, in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>within the range of the staff, which is not saying that the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major General</rs> cannot confide them to the delegates in each of the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> marching separately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>He will have sufficient to do to direct the whole, and to watch particularly over the marches of the main body which ordinarily accompany the general headquarters of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>We see then that there is no contradiction.</p></note> It will suffice, in my opinion, to give to the generals <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>special orders for what concerns their <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, and to join to them a few lines in cipher to indicate to them, in a few words, the <hi rend="italics">ensemble</hi> of the operation, and the part which is reserved to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>In default of this cypher, a verbal order will be confided to an officer capable of rightly conceiving it, and of rendering it exactly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>Indiscretion would no longer be feared, and the <hi rend="italics">ensemble</hi> of the operations would be assured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>Be this as it may, the draughting of those dispositions is in itself a very important thing, although it does not always accomplish what might be expected from it; every <num value="1">one</num> writes his instructions according to his views, his character, his capacity, and nothing could better indicate the degree of merit of the chiefs of an army, than the attentive perusal of the instructions which they have given to their lieutenants &mdash; it is the best biography that could be desired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>But it is time to quit this digression, in order to come to the article upon marches.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/><num value="3">3</num>. The army being assembled, and wishing to set about any enterprise whatever, the question will be to put it in motion with all the harmony and precision possible, taking all the measures in use for keeping it well informed, and covering it in its movements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> kinds of marches, those which are made out of view of the enemy, and those which have place in his presence when the question is to retire, or attack him. These marches, especially, have undergone great changes in the late campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>Formerly, armies seldom attacked each other until after having been several days in presence; then the attacking party caused to be opened by the pioneers parallel roads for the different columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>Now they attack more promptly, and are contented with existing roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>It is essential, however, when an army is in march, that pioneers and sappers follow the advanced guards to mutiply the issues to overcome difficulties, to throw at need small bridges over the streams, and to assure frequent communication between the various <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>In the present manner of marching, the calculation of time and of distances has become more complicated; the columns of an army all having different spaces to pass over, it is necessary to know how to combine the moment of their departure and their instructions:--<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, with the distances which they have to traverse; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, with the more or less considerable <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> that each will drag in its train; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, with the more or less difficult nature of the country; <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, with the reports as to the obstacles which the enemy may oppose to them; <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, with the degree of importance there should be as to their march being concealed or open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/><pb id="p.268" n="268"/></p> 
<p>In this condition of things, the means which appear the most sure and the most simple for ordering the movements, either of great corps forming the wings of the army, or of all those which should not march with the column where the general headquarters are found, will be to trust for their details to the experience of the generals commanding these corps, having care to habituate them to a great punctuality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>Then it will suffice to indicate to them the point and the object which they seek to attain, the route which they are to take, and the hour at which it is expected that they will arrive in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>Well understood that they are to be made acquainted with the corps which should march either with them or upon the lateral routes to the right and to the left, in order that they may be able to regulate themselves accordingly; finally they will be informed of what is known as to the presence of the enemy, and will have indicated to them a direction of retreat, if they should be constrained to <num value="1">one</num>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/> 
<p><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00268.00738" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> never did it, because he pretended that <num value="1">one</num> ought never to believe beforehand in the possibility of being beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>In many marches it is, in fact, a useless precaution, but in very many cases it is indispensable.</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>All the details which should here tend to prescribe daily to the chiefs of those corps the manner of forming their columns and of putting them in position, are pedantries more injurious than useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>To require that they march habitually according to all the rules or usages adopted, is a necessary thing; but they must be left the latitude of organizing their movements so as to arrive at the hour and the point indicated, under pain of sending them from the army if they fail in it by their fault or their ill will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>In retreats, nevertheless, which should be made in echelons upon a single route, it would be necessary to take precise measures for departures and halts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>As a matter of course, each column should have its small advanced guard and its flankers, in order to march according to the requisite precautions, and it is proper, even when they should march as a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, that at their head there be found always a few pioneers and sappers of the divisions, with implements for opening the necessary marches, or to repair the accidents which might happen; some of these workmen should be assigned to each column of the park.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>For the same reason a light equipage of trestles, for throwing small bridges, will always be of great utility.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/><num value="4">4</num>. An army often marches preceded by a general advanced guard, or what is more frequent in the modern system, the main body and each of the wings have their particular advanced guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>It is rather common <pb id="p.269" n="269"/>for the reserves and the centre to march together with the general headquarters, and according to every probability the general advanced guard, where there shall be <num value="1">one</num>, will follow the same direction, so that half of the army will be thus agglomerated upon the central route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>It is in those circumstances especially that it is necessary to know well how to take measures for avoiding encumbrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>It also happens, at times, that great blows, requiring to be directed upon a wing, the reserves and the general headquarters, even sometimes the general advanced guard are transported to the same side; in this case, all that which is indicated for the movements of the centre will be equally practicable and advisable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>It is essential that the advanced guards be accompanied by good officers of the staff, capable of judging well of the movements of the enemy, and of rendering an account of them to the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs> in order to enlighten his resolutions, which the commandant of the advanced guard will also do on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>Of course, a general advanced guard ought to be composed of light troops of all arms; some choice troops as a main body, a few dragoons equipped for fighting on foot, <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName>, pontoniers, sappers, &amp;c., with light trestles and pontoons for passing small rivers, a few carbiniers, good marksmen, will not be misplaced; and a topographical officer should equally follow to take a rough sketch of the country to <num value="0.5">a half</num> league or more, from each side of the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>Finally, it is indispensable to add to it the irregular cavalry as scouts, as much for sparing the good cavalry, as because the irregular troops are the most apt at this service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/><num value="5">5</num>. In proportion as the army advances and is removed from its base, the laws of a good <hi rend="italics">logistique</hi> indicate the necessity of organizing the line of operations and staple lines, which should serve as a bond between the army and this base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>The staff will divide these storehouses into districts, of which the chief place shall be in the city the most important for its resources in lodgings and in supplies of every kind; if there be a military post, the principal place will be established there in preference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>The storehouses placed at the distance of from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> leagues, according to existing cities; but, on an average of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> leagues, would thus be to the number of <num value="15">fifteen</num> upon a line of <num value="100">one hundred</num> leagues, and would form from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="4">four</num> magazine brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>Each <num value="1">one</num> of them would have a commander with a detachment of troops or of convalescent soldiers, for regulating the quarters, and to serve at the same time as a protection to the authorities of the country, (when they remain;) they will furnish safeguards to the post relays, and the necessary escorts; the commandant will see to the good condition of the routes and bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/><pb id="p.270" n="270"/></p> 
<p>As much as possible there ought to be made small magazines, and a park of a few wagons, in each of the depots, or at least at the principal places of the brigades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>The command of the territorial divisions will be confided to provident and capable general officers, for upon their operations often depend the security of the communications of the army.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/> 
<p>It will be objected that in national wars these magazines are impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>I shall say, on the contrary, that in such they will often be hazardous; but that it is in such precisely that they should be established upon a greater scale, and that they are the most necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>The line from Bayone to <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> had a similar staple line, which resisted <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> all the attacks of the guerrillas, although some convoys were taken; it was even extended for a time to <placeName reg="Cadiz, Cadiz, Andalucia" key="tgn,7007512">Cadiz</placeName>.</p></note> Those divisions can even, according to circumstances, be transformed into strategic reserves, as we have said in Article <num value="24">24</num>; some good battalions, aided by detachments unceasingly going from the army to its base, and from the base to the army, will almost always suffice for keeping up the communications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/><num value="6">6</num>. With regard to measures half logistical, half tactical, by means of which the staff should bring the troops from the order of march to the different orders of battle, it is a study as important as it is minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>The <num value="3">three</num> works which we have cited, have sufficiently sifted this matter to dispense with our following them on grounds so arduous; those questions could only be treated by taking up those details which make the merit of these works, and which are altogether beyond the limits of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>Besides, what would remain to us to say after the <num value="2">two</num> volumes which <persName n="Ternay,,M.,,,de" id="n0051.0008.00270.00739" reg="expanded:Ternay,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Ternay</surname></persName> and <persName n="Koch,Colonel,,,," id="n0051.0008.00270.00740" reg="mostcommon:Koch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Koch</surname></persName>, his commentator, have devoted to the demonstration of all the logistical combinations of the movements of troops, and of the different processes of formation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>And if many of those processes are very difficult to put in practice before an enemy, their utility will be acknowledged, at least, for the preparatory movements executed cuted out of his reach; thanks to that excellent manual, to the treatise of <persName n="Guibert,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00270.00741" reg="mostcommon:Guibert,nomatch:0"><surname>Guibert</surname></persName>, and to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> work of the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Duke,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00270.00742" reg="mostcommon:Duke,nomatch:0"><surname>Duke</surname></persName> (<hi rend="italics">Gransatze der hoheren Kriegskunst</hi>) we may easily instruct ourselves in all those logistical operations which are not permitted to us to pass over in silence, but which it suffices for our plan to point out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>Before quitting this interesting subject, I think it my duty to refer to some remarkable events in order to cause to be appreciated all the importance of good logistics: the <num value="1">one</num> is the miraculous assembling of the <rs>French</rs> army in the plains of <placeName reg="Gera, Como, Lombardia" key="tgn,7024451">Gera</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> ; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is the opening of the campaign in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>In both of these events <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00270.00743" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> knew how to collect together, with <pb id="p.271" n="271"/>an admirable precision, upon the decisive point of the zone of operations, his columns which had departed from the most divergent points.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/>The choice of this decisive point was a skillful strategic combination, the calculation of the movements was a logistical operation which emanated from his closet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>For a long time it was pretended that <persName n="Berthier,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00271.00744" reg="mostcommon:Berthier,nomatch:0"><surname>Berthier</surname></persName> was the author of those instructions conceived with so much precision, and communicated generally with so much lucidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>They are of <num value="2">two</num> kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> are purely topographical and statistical; they have for object the acquiring of ideas upon the country, its accidents of ground, its routes, defiles, bridges, &amp;c., of ascertaining its resources and its means of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>At this day, geography, topography and statistics have made so much progress that these reconnoissances are less necessary than formerly; meanwhile they will always be of great utility, so long as <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> shall not be registered: now it is probable she will never be so.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>The others are those which are ordered for assuring ourselves of the movements of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>They are made by detachments more or less strong; if the enemy is formed in presence, it is the generals or chiefs of the staff who should go in person and reconnoiter him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important means of well combining skillful manoeuvres of war, would unquestionably be never to order them except upon an exact knowledge of what the enemy might be doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>Indeed, how are we to know what we ourselves ought to do, if we be ignorant of what the adversary is doing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>But, as decisive as this knowledge might be, to the same degree it is difficult, not to say impossible, to acquire; and this is precisely <num value="1">one</num> of the causes which render the theory of war so different from the practice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>It is from this that come all the miscalculations of generals, who are educated men only, without having the natural genius for war, or without supplying it by the practical <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> which a long experience and a great habit of directing military operations can give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>It is always easy in leaving the walls of an academy, to make a project for outflanking a wing, for menacing the communication of the enemy, where you act for both parties at the same time, and where you dispose of them to your liking, either upon a geographical map or upon a fictitious plan of ground, but when you have to do with a skillful, active and enterprising adversary, all of whose movements are an enigma, then the embarrassment commences, and it is here that all the mediocrity of an ordinary general shows itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>I have acquired so many proofs of this truth in my long career, that if I had to test a general, I should esteem much more him who should make just suppositions upon the movements of the enemy, than him who should make a display of theories so difficult to make well, but so easy to apprehend when <num value="1">one</num> finds them all made.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>I shall explain this idea farther on.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>For all that passes in the interior of the hostile army, espionage seems the most sure, because a reconnoissance, however well made it may be, can give no notion of what passes beyond the advanced guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>That is not saying that they must not be made, for it is necessary to try all the means of being well instructed, but it means that the result must not be counted upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>It is the same with reports of prisoners of war, they are often useless, and it would oftener be dangerous to give credit to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>In every case, a skillful staff will not fail to choose certain instructed officers, who, charged with this especial service, will be able to direct their questions in such a manner as to distinguish among the replies what may be important to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>The partisans which are thrown as scouts in the midst of the lines of operations of the enemy, without doubt could learn something of his movements; but it is almost impossible to communicate with them, and to receive information from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>Spying, it is conceived, upon a large scale, will more generally succeed; however, it is difficult for a spy to penetrate to the closet of the enemy's general, and be able to wrest from him the secret of his enterprises; he will limit himself oftener to indicating the movements of which he is a witness, or those which he shall learn through public rumor, and when <num value="1">one</num> shall receive the information of those movements, he will know nothing of those which supervene in the interval, nor of the ulterior end which the enemy proposes to himself; he will know well, for example, that such a corps has passed through <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>, directing itself upon <placeName reg="Weimar, Erfurt, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012886">Weimar</placeName> &mdash; such another has passed through <placeName reg="Gera, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012815">Gera</placeName>, directing itself towards <placeName reg="Naumburg, Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt" key="tgn,7012847">Naumburg</placeName>; but where will they go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>What do they wish to undertake?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>This is what will be very difficult to learn even from the most skillful spy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>When armies encamped in tents, almost wholly united, then news of the enemy was more certain, for parties could be pushed even within sight of their camp, and spies could become instructed of all the movements <pb id="p.277" n="277"/>of those camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>But with the present organization into <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, which canton Or bivouac, the thing has become more complicated, more embarrassing, and in result almost nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>Espionage may render, nevertheless, good service when the army of the adversary is conducted by a great captain or a great sovereign, marching always with the major part of his forces and reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>Such were, for example, <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00277.00780" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>When it could be known where they had passed, and what direction they took, without stopping at the details of other movements, the project they had in view could be nearly calculated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>A skillful general may supply the inefficiency of all these means by hypotheses well laid down and well resolved in advance, and I may say it with a certain satisfaction, this means has seldom failed me, and I am rarely deceived in having recourse to it. If fortune has never put me at the head of an army, I have been, at least, chief of staff of nearly a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men, and called many times to the councils of the greatest sovereigns of our day, in which it was the question to direct the masses of the whole of armed <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and I have been deceived but <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times in the hypotheses I have laid down, and in the manner of resolving the questions which resulted from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>I am even convinced that every question well laid down, is almost always easy to resolve when <num value="1">one</num> has a sound judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>Now, as I have already said, I have constantly observed that an army being able to operate only upon the centre or upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities of its front of operations, there are scarcely ever more than <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> possible chances to foresee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>Hence a mind well penetrated with these truths, and embued with good principles of war, can always adopt a course which provides beforehand the most probable chances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>I shall allow myself to cite a few examples of them taken in my own experience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>When, in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>, they were yet undecided in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName> upon the war with <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, I made a memoir upon the probabilities of the war, and the operations which would have place in that contingency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>I established the <num value="3">three</num> following hypotheses:--<num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, the <name>Prussians</name> will await <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00277.00781" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> behind the <rs>Elbe</rs>, and will make defensive war to the <name>Oder</name>, in order to await the concurrence of <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>; <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, in the contrary case, they will advance upon the <name>Saale</name>, resting their left upon the frontier of Bohemia, and defending the outlets from the mountains of <placeName reg="Franken, Deutschland, Europe" key="tgn,7012456">Franconia</placeName>; <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, or else, expecting the <rs>French</rs> by the grand route of Mayence, they will advance imprudently to Erfurt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>I do not think there were any other possible chances to suppose, unless <pb id="p.278" n="278"/>it were believed that the <name>Prussians</name> were so badly advised as to divide their forces, already inferior, upon the <num value="2">two</num> directions of <placeName key="tgn,7005168" n="1.000 10" reg="Wesel,Dusseldorf,Nordrhein-Westfalen,Deutschland,Europe">Wesel</placeName> and of Mayence; a useless fault, since upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of those routes there had not appeared a French soldier since the <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>Well, those <num value="3">three</num> hypotheses thus laid down, if it were asked the course which best suited <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00278.00782" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> to adopt, was it not easy to conclude <quote>that the weight of the <rs>French</rs> army, being already assembled in <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>, it was necessary to throw it upon the left of the <name>Prussians</name> by <placeName reg="Gera, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012815">Gera</placeName> and <persName n="Hoff,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00278.00783" reg="mostcommon:Hoff,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoff</surname></persName>, for whatever hypotheses they should adopt, there was the <name>Gordion</name> knot of the whole campaign.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>Did they advance upon Erfurt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>By falling upon <placeName reg="Gera, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012815">Gera</placeName> they were cut off from their line of retreat and thrown back upon the <rs>Lower Elbe</rs>, to the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>Did they rest upon the <name>Saale</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>By attacking their left by <persName n="Hoff,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00278.00784" reg="mostcommon:Hoff,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoff</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Gera, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012815">Gera</placeName>, they were partially overwhelmed, and could yet be anticipated by <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipsic</placeName> at <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>If they remained finally behind the <rs>Elbe</rs>, it was always in the direction of <placeName reg="Gera, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012815">Gera</placeName> and <persName n="Hoff,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00278.00785" reg="mostcommon:Hoff,nomatch:0"><surname>Hoff</surname></persName> that it was necessary to seek them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>Hence what importance was it to know the detail of their movements, since the interest was always the same?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>Thus well convinced of these truths, I did not hesitate to announce--<hi rend="italics">a month before the war</hi>--that it would be what <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00278.00786" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> would undertake, and that if the <name>Prussians</name> passed the <name>Saale</name>, it would be at <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> and at <placeName reg="Naumburg, Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt" key="tgn,7012847">Naumburg</placeName> that they would fight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>What suppositions did the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002197">Brunswick</placeName> and his counsellors make at the same instant that I saw so accurately?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>In order to credit it, it is necessary to read them in the works of Mm.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>If I recall this circumstance, already more than once cited, it is not a feeling of vanity which leads me to it, because I would have other citations of this nature to make; but I have only desired to demonstrate that we may often act in war after problems well considered, without pausing too long at the details of the movements of our adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>If <persName n="Clausewitz,General,,,," id="n0051.0008.00278.00788" reg="nearbymention:Clausewitz,M.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Clausewitz</surname></persName> had been as often as myself in the position to weigh these problems, and see them resolved, he would not so much have doubted the efficacy of the theories of war founded upon principles, for it is those theories which alone will be able to serve as a guide for such solutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>His <num value="3">three</num> volumes upon war prove evidently that in a situation like that in which the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002197">Brunswick</placeName> was found in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>, he would have been quite as embarrassed as he was as to the course which it was necessary to <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Irresolution must be the accompaniment of minds which doubt everything.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>Returning to our subject I must confess that espionage has been singularly neglected in many modern armies, and in <dateStruct value="1813--"><year reg="1813">1813</year></dateStruct> among others the staff of the <rs>Prince</rs> of Schwartzenburg not having a sou at its disposition for this service, <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName> had to furnish funds from his chest to give to that staff the means of sending agents into Lusace to learn where <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00279.00789" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was. <persName n="Mack,General,,,," id="n0051.0008.00279.00790" reg="mostcommon:Mack,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mack</surname></persName> at <persName n="Ulm,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00279.00791" reg="mostcommon:Ulm,nomatch:0"><surname>Ulm</surname></persName> and the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Braunschweig, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002197">Brunswick</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct> were no better informed; and the <rs>French</rs> generals in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> often paid dear for the impossibility of having spies and information upon what was passing around them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>For information which can be obtained from flying corps, the <rs>Russian</rs> army is better off than any other, thanks to its Cossacks and the intelligence of its partizans.</p>

<p>Such examples however rare they may be suffice to give an idea of what can be expected from good partisans conducted by capable officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>To conclude I would sum up this article with the following truths:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>That a general ought to neglect nothing in order to be informed of the movements of the enemy and employ to this effect reconnoissances, spies, light corps conducted by capable officers, signals, finally, instructed officers charged with directing at the advanced guards the interrogation of prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2nd</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>That by multiplying reports however imperfect and contradictory they may be, we often succeed in separating the truth even from the midst of their contradictions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3rd</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>That it is necessary nevertheless to distrust these means and not to count too much upon them for the combination of our operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>That in default of sure and exact information a capable general ought never to put himself in march without having <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> courses taken upon the probable hypotheses which the respective situations of the armies would offer, and that those hypotheses be founded upon principles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>I could guaranty that in this case nothing very unexpected could come to surprise him, and cause him to lose his senses as often happens: for unless he be altogether incapable of commanding an army he ought to be able to make the most probable suppositions upon what the enemy will undertake, and to adopt in advance a course upon the <num value="1">one</num> of those suppositions, which should happen to be realized.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2841"/> 
<p>I shall not be accused I think of meaning that there never happens an event in war which is not foreseen; the surprises of Cremona, Bergen-op-Zoom, Hochkirch, will suffice to prove the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2842"/>I believe merely that those events approach always more or less <num value="1">one</num> of the hypotheses adopted or anticipated, so that <num value="1">one</num> could remedy them by the same means.</p></note> I could not too frequently repeat, that it is in like suppositions well laid down, and well resolved, that we recognize the true seal of military genius; and although the number of them be always very restricted, it is inconceivable to what degree this powerful means is neglected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/>In order to complete this article it remains for us to say also, what may be obtained by the aid of signals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>There are several kinds of them, and at the head of all we should naturally place telegraphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>It was to the idea he had of establishing a telegraphic line between his head quarters and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 9" reg="france">France</placeName>, that <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00280.00805" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> owed his astonishing success at <placeName key="tgn,7013496" n="1.000 10" reg="Regensburg,Oberpfalz,Bayern,Deutschland,Europe">Ratisbon</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2846"/>He was found yet at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> when the <name>Austrian</name> army passed the <rs type="place">Inn</rs> at Braunau, for invading <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName> <pb id="p.281" n="281"/>and piercing his cantonments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>Informed in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> of what passed at <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> leagues from him, he threw himself instantly into his carriage and <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> afterwards he was conqueror in <num value="2">two</num> battles under the walls of <placeName key="tgn,7013496" n="1.000 10" reg="Regensburg,Oberpfalz,Bayern,Deutschland,Europe">Ratisbon</placeName>; without the telegraph the campaign would have been lost: this fact suffices for appreciating its importance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2848"/>It has been imagined also to use the portable telegraph, and to my knowledge, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea of it belonged to a Russian merchant who had brought it from <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>These telegraphs manoeuvred by men on horseback posted upon heights, seem to be able to carry in a few minutes orders, from the centre to the extremities of a line of battle, as well as the reports of the wings to head quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>Repeated trials were made, but the project was abandoned without my knowing the reasons for it. Those communications could be in truth but very brief, and cloudy weather might make them sometimes uncertain: meanwhile as the vocabulary of similar reports could be reduced to a score of phrases, for which it would be easy to have conventional signs, I think that the mode should not be despised, though even we should be obliged to send the duplicate of its transmissions, by officers capable of well rendering verbal orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>We would always gain rapidity thereby.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>A trial of another nature was attempted in <dateStruct value="1794--"><year reg="1794">1794</year></dateStruct>, at the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7007879" n="1.000 10" reg="Fleurus,Province de Hainaut,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe">Fleurus</placeName>, where <persName n="Jourdan,General,,,," id="n0051.0008.00281.00806" reg="mostcommon:Jourdan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jourdan</surname></persName> employed an aeronaut for reconnoitering and making signals of the movements of the <name>Austrians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>I do not know whether he had occasion to congratulate himself on this trial, which was not again renewed, although it was pretended at the time that it had assisted in the victory, which I very much doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>It is probable that the difficulculty of having an aeronaut all ready to make his ascension at the moment when it should be opportune, that of observing well what passes below when <num value="1">one</num> has thus ventured in the air, and the instability of the winds may have caused this renunciation of the means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>By maintaining the balloon at an inconsiderable elevation, by placing in it an officer capable of judging of the movements of the enemy, and by perfecting a small number of signals which might be expected from it, are circumstances in which we might perhaps obtain some fruit from it. The smoke of the artillery however, the difficulty of distinguishing to which party belong the columns that <num value="1">one</num> sees moving like troops of Lilliputians, will always render those reports very uncertain: an aeronaut would have been sufficiently embarrassed to decide at the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs> if it were <persName n="Grouchy,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00281.00807" reg="mostcommon:Grouchy,nomatch:0"><surname>Grouchy</surname></persName> or <persName n="Blucher,,,,," id="n0051.0008.00281.00808" reg="mostcommon:Blucher,nomatch:0"><surname>Blucher</surname></persName> who arrived by St. Lambert; but in cases where armies are less mingled and more distinct, it seems that this means might be sometimes <pb id="p.282" n="282"/>turned to account.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>Strategy is composed of invarible geographic lines, the relative importance of which is calculated upon the situation of the hostile forces, a situation <pb id="p.284" n="284"/>which can never lead but to a small number of variations, since the hostile forces are found divided or collected either upon the centre, or upon <num value="1">one</num> of the extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>Nothing is more possible than to subject elements so simple to rules derived from the fundamental principle of war, in spite of the efforts of fastidious writers to perplex the science in endeavoring to render it too abstract and exact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>The cavalry was ordinarily placed on the <num value="2">two</num> wings, and the artillery, yet very heavy at this epoch, was distributed upon the front of each line (they <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>dragged <num value="16">sixteen</num> pounder guns, and there was no <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName>).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>Those divisions, composed ordinarily of infantry, artillery and cavalry, manoeuvred and fought separately; whether they were extended beyond measure for causing them to live without magazines, or whether they had the mania for prolonging their line, with the hope of outflanking that of the enemy, we often see <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> divisions of which an army is composed, march abreast upon as many routes at <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> leagues from each other; the <name>Headquarters</name> was placed at the centre without other reserve than <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> slender regiments of cavalry of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> horses; so that if the enemy chanced to unite the bulk of his forces upon <num value="1">one</num> of those divisions and defeat it, the line was found pierced, and the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, having no <orgName n="Infantry Reserve" type="military">infantry reserve</orgName> in hand, saw no other resource than to put himself in retreat to rally his scattered forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>It must be owned, this organization left little to be desired, and that grand army, which effected such great things, was soon the type upon which all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> was modeled.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>Some military men, dreaming of the perfectibility of the art, would have desired that the <orgName n="Infantry Division" type="division">infantry division</orgName>, called sometimes to fight by itself, were increased from <num value="2">two</num> brigades to <num value="3">three</num>, because his number, gives a centre and <num value="2">two</num> wings, which is of a manifest advantage, since without it the <num value="2">number two</num> gives for centre an opening an interval, and that the fractions forming the wings, deprived of central support, could not operate separately with the same security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>Besides that, the <num value="3">number three</num> permits <num value="2">two</num> brigades to be engaged, and have <num value="1">one</num> in reserve which evidently augments the disposable forces for the decisive shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>But if <num value="30">thirty</num> brigades, formed in <num value="10">ten</num> divisions of <num value="3">three</num> brigades each, are better than distributed into <num value="15">fifteen</num> divisions of <num value="2">two</num> brigades, it would be necessary, <pb id="p.287" n="287"/>to obtain this division organization, <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>, to augment the infantry by <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, or to reduce the divisions of the <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi> to <num value="2">two</num> instead of <num value="3">three</num>, which would be a more real evil, since the <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi> being oftener called to fight alone than a division, it is to it especially that the <num value="3">number three</num> is the most suitable.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>But then it is necessary to diminish the number of divisions, and to have only <num value="2">two</num> in each <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, which would be objectionable, since the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> are oftener required to manoeuvre alone than the division.</p></note> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>As for the rest, the best organization to give to an army entering the field, will be for a long time a logistical problem to resolve, because of the difficulty that is experienced in maintaining it in the midst of the events of the war, and the incessant detachments which they more or less necessitate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>Besides that, the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Bernadotte,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00287.00817" reg="mostcommon:Bernadotte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bernadotte</surname></persName></orgName> and <persName n="Marmont,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00287.00818" reg="mostcommon:Marmont,nomatch:0"><surname>Marmont</surname></persName>, detached to the right, and that of <persName n="Augereau,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00287.00819" reg="mostcommon:Augereau,nomatch:0"><surname>Augereau</surname></persName> detached to the left, were disposable for acting upon the flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>But from the passage of the <rs>Danube</rs> at Donauwert, all was disordered; <persName n="Ney,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00287.00820" reg="mostcommon:Ney,nomatch:0"><surname>Ney</surname></persName>, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reinforced to <num value="5">five</num> divisions, was reduced to <num value="2">two</num>; the main body was dislocated, part to the right, a part to the left, so that this fine order of battle became useless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>It will ever be difficult to give an organization at all stable; meanwhile events are not always as complicated as those of <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, and the campaign of <persName n="Moreau,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00287.00821" reg="mostcommon:Moreau,nomatch:0"><surname>Moreau</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, proves that the primitive organization can, to a certain point, be maintained, at least for the bulk of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>To this end it seems that the organization of the army into <num value="4">four</num> fractions, viz: <num value="2">two</num> wings, a centre, and a reserve, is the only rational <num value="1">one</num>; the composition of those fractions may vary according to the strength of the army, but in order to be able to maintain it, it will be indispensable to have a certain number of divisions out of line, to furnish the necessary detachments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>Those divisions whilst they are detached, could reinforce the <num value="1">one</num> or the other of those fractions which should be the most exposed to receive or to strike great blows; or else they would be employed either upon the flanks of the main body, or to double the reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>Each of the <pb id="p.288" n="288"/><num value="4">four</num> grand fractions of the main body may only form a single corps of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> divisions, or else be divided into <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> of <num value="2">two</num> divisions In this last case we should have <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 7">seven corps</orgName>, by counting but <num value="1">one</num> for the reserve; but it would be necessary that the latter should always have <num value="3">three</num> divisions, in order that the centre and the wings have each their reserve.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>In forming thus <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 7">seven corps</orgName>, if we had not always some out of line for detachments, it would often happen that the corps of the <num value="2">two</num> extremities would be found detached, so that there would remain for each wing but <num value="2">two</num> divisions, from which it would be necessary even at times to detach still a brigade to flank the march of the army, in such a manner that there would remain no more than <num value="3">three</num> brigades, which does not constitute a very strong order of battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>These truths lead to the belief that an organization of the line of battle into <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 4">four corps</orgName> of <num value="3">three</num> divisions of infantry and <num value="1">one</num> of light cavalry, besides <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> divisions destined for detachments, would be less subject to variations than <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 7">seven corps</orgName> of <num value="2">two</num> divisions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>For the rest, as all depends in these kinds of arrangements, on the strength of the army and the units which compose it, as much as on the nature of its enterprises, there result many variations which it would take too much space to detail here, and I will confine myself to tracing on the accompanying plate, the principal combinations which a formation would present, according as the divisions should be of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> brigades, and the corps of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>I have traced there the formation for <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> of infantry upon <num value="2">two</num> lines, either <num value="1">one</num> behind the other, or <num value="1">one</num> by the side of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>The latter leads us to examine if it can ever be suitable to place thus <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> the <num value="1">one</num> behind the other, as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00288.00822" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> has often done, especially at <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>I believe that with the exception of the reserves, this system could only be applied to a position of expectation, and by no means to an order of combat; for it is much preferable that each corps have in itself its <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line and its reserve, than to accumulate several corps under different chiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>However well disposed a general may be to sustain <num value="1">one</num> of his colleagues, it will ever be repugnant to him to divide his forces to that effect, and when, instead of a colleague, he shall see in the commander of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line but an envied rival, as happens only too often, it is probable that he will not furnish with haste the succors of which it might be in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>Besides that, a chief whose command is spread upon a long extent, is much less sure of his operations, than if he had only embraced half of this front, and when he would find in exchange in greater depth, the support which might be necessary to him. <pb id="p.289" n="289"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>If to these figures there is added <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> for cavalry, artillery and sappers, the force necessary for these various formations may be calculated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>It is necessary only to observe that regiments of <num value="2">two</num> battalions of <num value="800">800</num> men would be very weak at the end of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>If they have not <num value="3">three</num> battalions it would be necessary at least that the battalions should have <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct> men.</p></note> how much this question of the best formation is subordinate to the strength of the army, and how complicated it is.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>We can scarcely be regulated now a days, by the enormous masses put in action from <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, where we have seen <num value="1">one</num> army form <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 14">fourteen corps</orgName> which had from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="5">five</num> divisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>With such forces, it is incontestable that nothing can be imagined better than an organization by <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> of <num value="3">three</num> divisions; <num value="8">eight</num> of these corps would be destined for the line of battle, and there would remain <num value="6">six</num> as well for detachments as for reinforcing such points of this line as should be judged suitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>But to apply this system to armies already very respectable of <num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num> men only, we can scarcely employ divisions of <num value="2">two</num> brigades, where <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00289.00823" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> and the <name>Allies</name> employed entire <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>In effect, if we destine <num value="9">nine</num> divisions to form the main body, that is to say, the <num value="2">two</num> wings and the centre, and design <num value="6">six</num> others for the reserve and the eventual detachments, there would be necessary <num value="15">fifteen</num> divisions or <num value="30">thirty</num> brigades, which would <num value="180">number one hundred and eighty</num> battalions, if the regiments are of <num value="3">three</num> battalions each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>Now this supposes already a mass of a <num value="145000">hundred and forty-five thousand</num> foot, and an army of <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> combattants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>With regiments of <num value="2">two</num> battalions it would require, it is true, but a <num value="120">hundred and twenty</num> battalions, or <num value="96000">ninety-six thousand</num> foot, but if the regiments have only <num value="2">two</num> battalions, then the force of the latter ought to be increased to a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men, which would always give an <num value="120000">hundred and twenty thousand</num> foot, and an army of a <num value="160000">hundred and sixty thousand</num> men. These calculations alone prove how much the system of formation of inferior fractions influence that of the grand fractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/><pb id="p.290" n="290"/></p> 
<p>If an army does not exceed a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men, the formation in divisions, as in <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct>, would be better perhaps than that by corps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>After having sought the best mode for giving a somewhat stable organization to battle corps, it will not be out of place to examine whether this stability is desirable, and whether we do not better deceive the enemy by frequently changing the composition of corps and their position.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>I do not deny this last advantage, but it is possible to harmonize it with that which procures approximate stability in the order of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>If we unite the divisions destined for detachments with the wings and the centre, that is to say, if we compose those fractions of <num value="4">four</num> divisions, instead of <num value="3">three</num>, and if at times we add <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> divisions to that <num value="1">one</num> of the wings which should be the most probably destined to the principal shock, we shall have at the wings corps which will be nominally of <num value="4">four</num> divisions, but which by detachments will ordinarily have but <num value="3">three</num>, and at times might be reduced to <num value="2">two</num>, whilst that the opposite wing, reinforced by a part of the reserve until the concurrence of <num value="5">five</num> divisions, would present a sufficiently marked difference, in order that the enemy should never know exactly the real force of the fractions of the main body which he would have before him. There would be by this means more unity in the orders of movements of the staff, more facility for daily expeditions, and in the mean time not enough regularity to allow the enemy to know always precisely with whom he would have to do. I perceive, however, that I am engaged too far in an arena into which I ought not even to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>It is for governments to decide those questions which merit a mature examination, and ought to make the object of an instruction for the staff; instruction, nevertheless, which should not impose absolute chains on the generalissimo, who ought always to have the power to regulate his forces according to his particular views, and the extent of the enterprises which he should form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>Definitively whatever may be the force and the number of the subdivisions or fractions of the army, the organization by <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, will remain probaby a long time the normal type with all the great continental powers, and it is on this truth that the line of battle should be calculated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>If the distribution of the troops in them is different from what it formerly was, the line of battle itself has also undergone some changes which result from the reserves, and the light cavalry attached to the various corps of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>Formerly it was composed ordinarily of <num value="2">two</num> lines, now it is composed of <num value="2">two</num> lines, with <num value="1">one</num> or several reserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>But in latter times the <rs>European</rs> masses which encountered each other became, go considerable, that the <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi>, themselves formed upon <num value="2">two</num> lines, <pb id="p.291" n="291"/>being found often placed the <num value="1">one</num> behind the other, formed thus <num value="4">four</num> lines; and the corps of reserve being formed also in the same manner, there resulted frequently, even <num value="6">six</num> lines of infantry, and several of cavalry, a formation good perhaps for a preparatory position, but which is too deep for battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>However that may be, the classic formation, if this name can be given it, is still, for the infantry, that upon <num value="2">two</num> lines; the more or less confined extent of the field of battle, and the forces of the armies could well give rise sometimes to a deeper formation, but this will always be an exception, or used for a last effort, for the order upon <num value="2">two</num> lines besides the reserves, appearing to suffice for solidity, and giving more forces fighting at a time, seems also the most suitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>When the army possesses a permanent corps as an advanced guard, this corps could also be formed in advance of the line of battle, or withdrawn to the rear for augmenting the reserve,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/> 
<p>The advanced guard being every day exposed in face of the enemy, and forming even the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, when it is the question to retrograde, it seems but just, at the moment of the battle, to give it a less exposed post than that in front of the line of battle.</p></note> but as has already been said elsewhere, that rarely happens after the manner of the present formations, and the mode of combining the marches they require; each wing of the army has its own advanced guard, and that of the main body finds itself quite naturally furnished by the troops of the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> which should march in front; when the army arrives in presence, those divisions reenter into their respective battle positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>Often even the reserves of cavalry are found almost entirely in the advanced guard, which does not prevent their taking the post assigned them, at the moment of delivering battle, either from the nature of the ground, or from the views of the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>After what we have just explained, our readers will be assured that the methods followed since the revival of the art of war and the invention of gunpowder until the <rs>French Revolution</rs>, have undergone great changes through the present organization, and that in order to appreciate well the wars of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>, of <persName><foreName>Peter</foreName></persName> the <rs>Great</rs>, and of <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>, it is necessary to refer them to the system adopted in their time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>However, a part of the ancient methods can still be employed, and if, for example, the position of the cavalry on the wings is no longer a fundamental rule, it might be good for an army of <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> men, especially when the centre is found upon a ground less suitable to this arm than the <num value="1">one</num> or the other of the extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>It is generally the custom <pb id="p.292" n="292"/>to attach <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> brigades of light cavalry to each of the infantry corps; those in the centre place it in preference behind the line, those of the wings may place it upon their flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>With regard to the reserves of this arm, if it be sufficiently strong for organizing <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">three corps</orgName>, to the end that the centre and each of the wings have its reserve, it would be an order as perfect as could be desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>In default of that, we could dispose this reserve in <num value="2">two</num> columns, the <num value="1">one</num> at the point where the centre is connected with the right, the other between the centre and the left; these columns could thus arrive with the same facility upon every point of the line which should be menaced.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/> 
<p>It is well understood that this position supposes a ground favorable for that arm, a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> condition of every well combined order of battle</p></note> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>The artillery, now more movable, is indeed as formerly distributed upon the whole front, since each division has its own. Meanwhile it is well to observe that, its organization being perfected, we can better distribute it according to need, and it is ever a great fault to scatter it too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>There exists, for the rest, few positive rules upon this distribution of artillery, for who would dare to counsel, for example, to block up a gap in a line of battle, by placing a <num value="100">hundred</num> pieces in a single battery, far from the whole line, as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00292.00824" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> did with so much success at <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>Not being able here to enter into all the details of this arm, we will limit ourselves to saying:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/><num value="1">1</num>. That <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName> ought to be placed upon the ground where it can be moved in every direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/><num value="2">2</num>. That <orgName n="Foot Artillery" type="artillery">foot artillery</orgName>, especially that of position, would be better posted, on the contrary, upon a point where it would he covered by ditches, or by hedges which would secure it against a sudden charge of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>I need not say that, in order to preserve to it its greatest effect, we should be careful not to post it upon too elevated eminences, but rather upon flat grounds or slopes like a glacis; this is what every sous-lieutenant ought to know.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/><num value="3">3</num>. If the <orgName n="Horse Artillery" type="artillery">horse artillery</orgName> be principally joined to the cavalry, it is well, however, that each <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> have its own, for gaining rapidly a point essential to occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>Besides that, it is proper that there be some of it in the <orgName n="Artillery Reserve" type="military">artillery reserve</orgName>, in order to be able to direct it with more promptitude to the succor of a menaced point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/><persName n="Benningsen,General,,,," id="n0051.0009.00292.00825" reg="mostcommon:Benningsen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Benningsen</surname></persName> had cause to congratulate himself at <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName> for having united <num value="58">fifty-eight</num> pieces in reserve, for they contributed powerfully to re-establishing affairs between the centre and the left where his line chanced to be broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/><pb id="p.293" n="293"/></p> 
<p><num value="4">4</num>. If <num value="1">one</num> be on the defensive, it is proper to place a part of the batteries of heavy calibre upon the front, instead of holding them in reserve, since it is the object to batter the enemy at the greatest possible distance, in order to arrest the impulsion of his attack and to scatter confusion in his columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/><num value="5">5</num>. In the same condition it seems suitable, that apart from the reserve, the artillery be equally distributed upon the whole line, since <num value="1">one</num> has an equal interest in repelling the enemy upon every point; this, meanwhile, is not rigorously true, for the nature of the ground, and the evident projects of the enemy, might necessitate the carrying of the bulk of the artillery upon a wing or upon the centre.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/><num value="6">6</num>. In the offensive it may be equally advantageous to concentrate a very strong artillery mass upon a point where we should wish to direct a decisive effort, to the end of making a breach in the hostile line, which would facilitate the grand attack upon which might depend the success of the battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>Having to treat here only of the distribution of the artillery, we shall speak farther on of its employment in combats.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>The infantry is, without contradiction, the most important arm, since it forms the <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of an army, and it is it which carries positions or defends them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>But if it must be admitted that next to the talent of the general it is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instrument of victory, it must be owned also that it finds a powerful support in the cavalry and artillery, and that without their assistance it would often find itself much exposed, and able only to gain half successes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>We shall not evoke here the old disputes upon the shallow and the deep order, although the question, which was thought to be decided, is far from being exhausted, and placed in a point of view which permits the resolving it by examples and probabilities, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2969"/>The war with <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 6" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> and the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs> have renewed the controversies relative to the advantages <pb id="p.294" n="294"/>of fire, or the shallow order, over the impulsion of columns of attack, or the deep order; we shall express our opinion farther on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2970"/>In the meantime we must not be misunderstood; it is no longer the question now to dispute whether <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00294.00826" reg="mostcommon:Lloyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName> was right in wishing to give to the infantry a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> rank armed with pikes, to the end of offering a greater shock in moving upon the enemy, or more resistance in receiving his attack; every experienced military man acknowledges in our day, that there is already sufficient difficulty in moving with order, battalions deployed in <num value="3">three</num> closed ranks, and that a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> rank would add to this embarrassment, without adding the least thing to their strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>It is astonishing that <persName n="Lloyd,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00294.00827" reg="mostcommon:Lloyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Lloyd</surname></persName>, who had made war, should have insisted so much upon this material force; for the contact is very rarely sufficiently close, in order that this mechanical superiority be put to the test; and if these ranks turn their backs, it is not the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> that will restrain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>This augmentation of a rank diminishes, in the defensive, the front and the fire, whilst that in the offensive, it is far from offering the mobility and the impulsion which are the advantages of columns of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2973"/>We might affirm even that it will diminish that impulsion, for it is more difficult to cause <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men to march in line of battle with <num value="4">four</num> full ranks than in <num value="3">three</num>, although there be <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> less extent of front: the difficulty of the jointing of the <num value="2">two</num> middle ranks, amply makes up for this slight difference.</p>

He would deploy <num value="20">twenty</num> battalions, leaving between each of them a <measure n="150yards" type="distance">hundred and fifty yards</measure>, that is to say, an interval equal to their front; we may imagine what would become of those battalions all disunited and isolated at such a distance, leaving between them <num value="20">twenty</num> gaps where cavalry could penetrate in strong columns, to take them in flank, and sweep them like dust before the wind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>The question, we have said, no longer consists in discussing upon the augmentation of the number of ranks of a line, but merely to decide whether it ought to be composed of deployed battalions, acting only by their fire, or rather of columns of attack formed, each of a battalion ployed upon the <num value="2">two</num> platoons of the centre, and acting only by their impulsion and their impetuosity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2976"/>Several modern writers have treated these matters with sagacity, without any <num value="1">one</num> of them succeeding to present any thing conclusive, because in tactics all is much more subjected to unexpected events, to sudden inspirations, to the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi>, and to individualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>Perhaps he has not been sufficiently conclusive and has allowed yet some uncertainty to hover over the solution of the problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>Like his predecessors, he has not enquired whether the <rs>French</rs> columns, repulsed by the fire of the deployed <rs>English</rs>, were not masses much too deep, instead of being merely columns of a single battalion, like those of which we have just made mention, which would constitute a capital difference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>I shall resume the points of view which the question presents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2986"/>There exist, in fact, but <num value="5">five</num> modes in forming troops for encountering the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2987"/><num value="1">1</num>. As skirmishers;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2988"/><num value="2">2</num>. Into deployed lines, either continuous or checker-wise, (<hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier;</hi>)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2989"/><num value="3">3</num>. In lines of battalions ployed upon the centre of each battalion;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2990"/><num value="4">4</num>. In deep masses;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/><num value="5">5</num>. In small squares</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2992"/>The skirmishers are an accessorary, for they ought only to cover the line properly so called by favor of the ground, to protect the march of the columns, to fill up the intervals, or defend the approaches of a post.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2993"/>These divers modes of formation are thus reduced to <num value="4">four</num> systems: the shallow order, or the <num value="1">one</num> deployed into <num value="3">three</num> ranks: the half deep order, formed of a line of battalions in columns of attack upon the centre, or of squares by battalions; the mixed order where the regiments should be in part deployed, and partly in columns; finally, the deep order, composed of heavy columns of battalions, deployed the <num value="1">one</num> behind the; other</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>The order deployed upon <num value="2">two</num> lines, with a reserve, was formerly generally used, it is especially useful in the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2995"/>Those deployed lines may be continuous, formed checker-wise, (<hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier</hi>,) or in echelons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2996"/><pb id="p.296" n="296"/></p> 
<p>The order by which each battalion of a line is found formed in column of attack by divisions upon the centre, is more concentrated; it is in some sort a line of small columns, (like the figure <num value="5">5</num> of the opposite plate.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2997"/>In the present regulation of <num value="3">three</num> ranks, the battalion having <num value="4">four</num> divisions,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/> 
<p>The word <hi rend="italics">division</hi>, employed to express <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> regiments, as well as for designating <num value="2">two</num> platoons of the same battalion, creates a confusion in tactical language which it would be important to abolish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>It is to the regulations alone that this right is reserved.</p></note> this column would present <num value="12">twelve</num> ranks in depth, which gives perhaps too many non-combattants, and too much exposure of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>To diminish these inconveniences, it has been proposed, whenever it should be desired to employ infantry in columns of attack, to form it into <num value="2">two</num> ranks, to place but <num value="3">three</num> divisions of each battalion behind each other, and to deploy the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> as skirmishers in the intervals of the battalions and upon the flanks, but to rally them behind the <num value="3">three</num> divisions, if the enemy's cavalry chanced to charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>(See figure <num value="6">6</num>.) Each battalion would have by this means <num value="200">two hundred</num> more shots, besides those which the increase, by <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, of the front would give by putting the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> rank in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>Thus there would be in fact but a depth of <num value="6">six</num> men, and we should obtain <num value="100">one hundred</num> files front, and <num value="400">four hundred</num> shots for each column of attack of a battalion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>There would thus be strength and mobility united.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/> 
<p>In the <rs>Russian</rs> army, they take the skirmishers from the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> rank of each company or division, which reduces the column to <num value="8">eight</num> ranks instead of <num value="12">twelve</num>, and procures more mobility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>But for facility in rallying the skirmishers in column, perhaps it would be better to employ for them the entire <orgName type="division" n="division 4">fourth division</orgName>; <num value="1">one</num> would then have <num value="9">nine</num> ranks, or <num value="3">three</num> divisions of <num value="3">three</num> ranks each, against infantry, and the full column of <num value="12">twelve</num> ranks against cavalry.</p></note> A battalion of <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men, formed, after the method in use, into column of <num value="4">four</num> divisions, presents about <num value="60">sixty</num> files to each division, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> alone firing by <num value="2">two</num> ranks, there would be but <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> shots to furnish for each of the battalions thus placed in line, whereas, according to the mode proposed, there would be <num value="400">four hundred</num> delivered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>But whilst seeking the means of obtaining more fire at need, it is important to recollect also that the column of attack is not destined to fire, and that it ought to reserve this means for a desperate case; for, if it commences to fire in marching upon the enemy, its impulsion will become null, and the attack will fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>Besides that, this reduced order would be advantageous only against infantry, for the column of <num value="4">four</num> sections of <num value="3">three</num> ranks, forming a kind of solid square, is better against cavalry.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>In order to give more solidity to the column proposed, we could in truth call in the skirmishers and reform the <orgName type="regiment" key="4Section">fourth section</orgName>; but there would always be but <num value="2">two</num> ranks, which would present much less resistance against a charge principally upon the flanks.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>I have explained all the parts of the process; it remains for me to observe that if it were desired to adopt the formation in <num value="2">two</num> ranks for the column of attack, it would be difficult to preserve that in <num value="3">three</num> ranks for deployed lines, an army being scarcely able to have <num value="2">two</num> modes of formation, or at least to employ them alternately on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>Hence what <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> army (if we except the <rs>English</rs>) could be risked to deploy in lines of <num value="2">two</num> ranks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>It would be necessary in this case never to move but in column of attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>I conclude from thence that thesystem employed by the <name>Russians</name> and the <name>Prussians</name>, that of forming the column of <num value="4">four</num> divisions in <num value="3">three</num> ranks, of which <num value="1">one</num> could at need be employed as skirmishers, is that which is generally applicable to all situations, whilst that the other of which we have spoken is suitable only in certain cases, and would require a double mode of formation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>Independently of the <num value="2">two</num> orders above mentioned, there exists a mixed, which <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00297.00838" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> employed at the <name>Tagliamento</name>, and the <name>Russians</name> at <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>; their regiments of <num value="3">three</num> battalions deployed <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, and formed the other <num value="2">two</num> behind this <num value="1">one</num>, upon the platoons of its extremities, (fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/><num value="2">2</num>, same plate.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>This regulation, which belongs also to the semi-profound order, is suitable, in fact, for the offensive-defensive, because the troops deployed in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line resist a long time by a murderous fire, the effect of which always somewhat shakes the enemy; then the troops, formed in column, <pb id="p.298" n="298"/>can debouch through the intervals and throw themselves upon him with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>perhaps we could augment the advantage of this formation by placing the <num value="2">two</num> battalions of the wings upon the same line as that of the centre, which would be deployed in such a manner that the <orgName type="division" n="divisions 1">first divisions</orgName> of those battalions would be in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>There would thus be <num value="0.5">a half</num> battalion more for each regiment in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, which for fire would not be inconsiderable; but it might be feared that those divisions putting themselves in condition for firing, the <num value="2">two</num> battalions kept in column to be launched upon the enemy would be less easily disposable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>However, there are many cases where such an order would be advantageous, it is sufficiently so for rendering it a duty to indicate it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>The order in very deep masses is certainly the least suitable, (fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/><num value="3">3</num>.) We have seen in the late wars, divisions of <num value="12">twelve</num> battalions deployed and compressed behind each other, forming <num value="36">thirty-six</num> crowded and accumulated ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>Such masses are exposed to the ravages of artillery, diminish mobility and impulsion, without adding any strength.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>When it is decided to risk such a mass, it is necessary, at least, to take care to establish upon each flank a battalion marching by files, in order that if the enemy chanced to charge in force upon those flanks, it would not oblige the column to halt, (see fig. <num value="3">3</num>;) protected by those battalions which will face to the enemy, it will be able at least to continue its march to the object assigned it, otherwise this great mass, battered by converging fires to which it has no means of opposing even a proper impulsion, will be put in disorder like the column at Fontenoi, or broken as the <rs>Macedonian</rs> phalanx was by <persName n="Aemilius,,Paulus,,," id="n0051.0009.00298.00843" reg="default:Aemilius,Paulus,,,"><foreName>Paulus</foreName> <surname>Aemilius</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>Squares are good in plains and against an enemy superior in cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>They were made formerly very large, but it is acknowledged that the square by regiment is the best for the defensive, and the square by battalion for the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>We can, according to circumstances, form them into perfect squares or into long squares, in order to present a greater front, and obtain more fire on the side from whence the enemy is expected to come, (see fig. <num value="8">8</num> and <num value="9">9</num>.) A regiment of <num value="3">three</num> battalions would easily form a long square by breaking the middle battalion and causing each half battalion to move, the <num value="1">one</num> to the right, and the other to the left.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>In the wars with <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, squares were almost exclusively employed, <pb id="p.299" n="299"/>because hostilities took place in the vast plains of Bassarabia, of <placeName key="tgn,7006656" n="1.000 1" reg="moldava">Moldavia</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,7016657" n="1.000 1" reg="valahia">Wallachia</placeName>, and the <name>Turks</name> had an immense cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>But, if operations have place in the <name>Balkan</name> or beyond, and if their feudal cavalry give place to an arm organized in the <rs>European</rs> proportions, the importance of squares will diminish, and the <rs>Russian</rs> infantry will show all its superiority in Romelia.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>Be that as it may, the order in squares by regiments of battalions appears suitable to every kind of attack, whenever there is a superiority in cavalry, and we manoeuvre on even ground, favorable to the charges of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>The long square, applied especially to a battalion of <num value="8">eight</num> platoons, of which <num value="3">three</num> should march abreast, and <num value="1">one</num> upon each of the sides, would be better for moving to the attack than a deployed battalion; it would be less suitable than the column proposed farther back, but there would be less wavering and more impulsion than if it marched in a deployed line; it would have, moreover, the advantage for being in condition against cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3039"/>It would be difficult to affirm that each of those formations are always good, or always bad; but it will be admitted, at least, that it is an incontestable rule that, for the offensive, there is necessary a mode which should unite <hi rend="italics">mobility, solidity</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">impulsion</hi>, whilst for the defensive there is wanted <hi rend="italics">solidity</hi> united <hi rend="italics">to the greatest possible fire</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>This truth admitted, it will remain to decide whether the bravest offensive troops, formed in columns and deprived of fire, will hold out long against deployed troops having <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> musket shots to send it, and able to deliver it <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>Meanwhile, it would be imprudent to conclude from thence that this result should cause the balance to incline decidedly in favor of the shallow order and of fire; for, if the <rs>French</rs> were accumulated in all these affairs into masses too profound, as I have more than once seen with my own eyes, it is not astonishing that enormous columns, formed into deployed and wavering battalions, battered in front and flank by a murderous fire, and assailed on all sides, have experienced the fate which we have pointed out above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>But would the same result have taken place with columns <pb id="p.300" n="300"/>of attack formed each of a single battalion ployed upon the centre according to rule?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>I do not think so, and in order to judge of the decided superiority of the shallow or firing order, over the half deep order, or that of offensive impulsion, it would be necessary to witness repeatedly what would happen to a deployed line which should be boldly attacked by an enemy thus formed, (fig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/><num value="6">6</num> of plate <num value="2">2</num>.) As for myself, I can affirm that, in all the actions in which I have been, I have seen these little columns succeed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>Moreover, is it easy to adopt another order for marching to the attack of a position?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>Is it possible for this purpose to conduct an immense line in deployed order and firing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3048"/>I believe that every <num value="1">one</num> will pronounce for the negative: to throw <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="30">thirty</num> battalions in line, executing a fire by file or by platoon, with the object of crowning a position well defended, is to arrive there in disorder like a flock of sheep, or rather it is never to succeed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>What ought we to conclude from all that we have just said?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>, That if the deep order is dangerous, the semi-profound order is excellent for the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>, That the column of attack by battalions is the best order for carrying positions, but that is is necessary to diminish as much as possible its depth, to give more fire at need, and to diminish the effect of the enemy's fire; it is proper, moreover, to cover it by many skirmishers, and to sustain it by cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>, That the deployed order as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, with the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in column, is that which is the best suited to the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, That the <num value="1">one</num> and the other may triumph according to the talent a general shall have for employing seasonably his disposable forces, as we have said in treating of the initiative, in Article <num value="16">16</num> and Article <num value="31">31</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>In truth, since this chapter was written, the numerous inventions which have had place in the art of destroying men would he able to militate in favor of the deployed order, even for moving to the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>However, it would be difficult to anticipate the lessons which it is necessary to look for from experience alone, for despite all that rocket batteries, the howitzers of Schrapnel or of Bourman, and even the guns of <persName n="Perkins,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00300.00846" reg="mostcommon:Perkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Perkins</surname></persName>, could offer redoubtable; I own that I should have difficulty in conceiving a better system for leading infantry to the assault of a position, than that of the column by battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>Perhaps it will even be necessary to give back to the infantry the casques and cuirasses that it wore in the <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> century, before throwing it upon the enemy in deployed lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>But if we return decidedly to this deployed system, it would be necessary, at least, in marching to the attack to find a more favorable means than that of long continuous lines, and to adopt either columns at distances for deploying on arriving at the enemy's position, or lines broken <hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier</hi>, or <pb id="p.301" n="301"/>finally the march in battle by the flank of platoons, operations all more or less dangerous in front of an adversary who knows how to profit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>Meanwhile, as we have said, a skillful general can, according to circumstances and localities, combine the employment of the <num value="2">two</num> systems.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>If experience has proved to me long since that <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult problems of the tactics of war was the best mode of forming troops for going to combat, I have found out also that to resolve this great problem in an absolute manner, and by an exclusive system, is a thing impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>In the first place, the nature of countries differ essentially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>There are those where we can manoeuvre <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men deployed, as in Champagne; there are others, like <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, <placeName reg="Switzerland" key="tgn,7011731">Switzerland</placeName>, the <rs type="place">valley of the Rhine</rs>, the half of <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>, where we could scarcely deploy a division of <num value="10">ten</num> battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/>The degree of instruction of the troops in all kinds of manoeuvres, their armament and their national character, could also have an influence upon formations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>By favor of the great discipline of the <rs>Russian</rs> infantry, and of its instruction in manoeuvres of every species, it is possible that they may succeed in moving it in great lines with sufficient order and harmony for causing it to adopt a system which would, I think, be impracticable with the <rs>French</rs> or the <name>Prussians</name> at this day. My experience of this kind has taught me to believe everything possible, and I am not of the number of orthodox persons who admit but <num value="1">one</num> same type and <num value="1">one</num> same system for all armies, as for all countries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>In order to approach the nearest possible to the solution of the problem, it seems to me then that we ought to seek--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>(a) The best mode of moving in sight of the enemy, but still out of reach of his shot;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>(b) The best mode of advancing to the attack;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>(c) The best order of defensive battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>Whatever solution may be given to these questions, it appears to me suitable, in every case, to exercise the troops:--</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3069"/><num value="1">1</num>. In the march in columns of battalions upon the centre, for deploying, if desired, within reach of the musket, or for advancing on the enemy, even with the columns, if it be necessary;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3070"/><num value="2">2</num>. In the march in deployed and continuous lines, by <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> battalions at a time;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3071"/><num value="3">3</num>. In the march <hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier</hi> of battalions deployed, which&gt; offer broken lines more easy to move than long continuous lines; <pb id="p.302" n="302"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3072"/><num value="4">4</num>. In the march in advance by the flanks of platoons;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3073"/><num value="5">5</num>. In the march in advance by small squares, either in line or <hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier;</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3074"/><num value="6">6</num>. In the changes of front, by means of these various methods of marching;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3075"/><num value="7">7</num>. In the changes of front executed by columns of platoons at full distances, in order to reform without deployment; a means which is more expeditious than the other modes of changing front, and which is better adapted to all kinds of ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3076"/>Of all the modes of moving in advance, the march by flanks of platoons would be the easiest if it did not offer some danger; on level ground it answers marvellously, on rough ground it is the most convenient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3077"/>It has the inconvenience of much fracturing the line; but by habituating the chiefs and the soldiers to it, by dressing well the guides of platoons, and the directing colors, all confusion could be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3078"/>The only objection which could be offered to it would be the fear of exposing the disjointed platoons to the danger of a rush of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3079"/>I do not deny the danger, but it can be avoided either by being well watched by the cavalry, or by not employing this order too near the enemy, but only for crossing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part of a great space which should separate the <num value="2">two</num> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3080"/>At the least sign of the approach of the enemy, the line could be reformed in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, since there would only be necessary the time required for a platoon to place itself by file in line at the marching step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3081"/>However, whatever precautions we may take, it must nevertheless be confessed that this manoeuvre could only be employed with troops well disciplined and well exercised, but never with militia or young soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3082"/>I have never seen it used before the enemy, but only in manoeuvres; and for the changes of front especially, it was employed with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3083"/>We could always try it in the great annual manoeuvres.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3084"/>I have also seen tried, marches in lines of battalions deployed <hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier;</hi> these marches did very well, whilst those in full or continuous lines were always horribly bad. The <rs>French</rs>, especially, have never known how to march well in deployed lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3085"/>Perhaps those marches <hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier</hi> would be found also dangerous in case of an unexpected charge of cavalry; we could, however, employ them for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of the march, to the end of rendering it more easy, then the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquiers</hi> could enter in line with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> before assailing the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3086"/>Besides, by placing but a small distance between the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquiers</hi> it would be always easy to form the line at the instant of a charge, for it must not be forgotten <pb id="p.303" n="303"/>that the <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquiers</hi> do not constitute <num value="2">two</num> lines, but a single <num value="1">one</num>, which has been divided in order to avoid the wavering and the disorder of a march in continuous line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3087"/>The best formation for charging seriously the enemy is not less diffcult to point out. Of all the trials which I have seen made, that which appeared to me to succeed the best was the march of <num value="24">twenty-four</num> battalions upon <num value="2">two</num> lines of columns by battalions formed upon the centre for deploying; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line went at the charge step upon the enemy's line, and arrived within twice the range of musketry, it deployed in the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3088"/>The company of voltigeurs of each battalion was deployed as skirmishers, the others were formed, then commenced a sustained fire by file; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of columns followed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and the battalions which composed it threw themselves at the charge step through the intervals of the companies which were firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3089"/>This was done, in truth, without an enemy, and it seemed that nothing could have resisted this double effect of the fire and of the column.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3090"/>Besides those lines of columns, there are yet <num value="3">three</num> other means of moving to the attack in semi-deep order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3091"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is that of lines mingled with deployed battalions and battalions in column upon the wings of those deployed, of which we have spoken at <ref n="page 297">page 297</ref>. The deployed battalions and the <orgName type="division" n="divisions 1">first divisions</orgName> of those in column would fire at half musket range, and afterwards throw themselves upon the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3092"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is to advance with the deployed line, and firing, to within half musket range, then to throw the columns of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line through the intervals of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3093"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> is the echelon order, mentioned on <ref n="page 213">page 213</ref>, and in figure <num value="11">11</num> of plate <num value="1">1</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3094"/>Finally, the last mode is to advance entirely in deployed order, by the sole ascendant of the fire until <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> parties retreat, which appears almost impracticable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3095"/>I cannot affirm which of those modes would be the most suitable, for I have seen nothing of the like in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3096"/>In fact, in war, I have never seen anything in the combats of infantry, but battalions deployed beforehand, which commence firing by platoon, then engaging by degrees a fire by file; or else by columns marching fiercely upon the enemy, which fled without awaiting the shot, or which repulsed those columns before the actual meeting, either by its firm continuance or by its fire; or, finally, <pb id="p.304" n="304"/>by taking, itself, the offensive by advancing to the rencounter.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3097"/> 
<p>I have often seen, also, great combats where the half of the infantry was engaged by platoon as skirmishers; but that enters into the category of battalions engaged in an irregular file firing.</p></note> It is scarcely but in villages and defiles that I have seen real melees of infantry in column, the heads of which encountered with the bayonet; in battle position I have never seen the like.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3098"/>However it may be with regard to these controversies, we could not too often repeat, it would be absurd to reject the fire of musketry, as well as to renounce semi-profound columns, and the imposing an absolute system of tactics for all countries and against all nations indiscriminately, would be to ruin an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3099"/>It is less the mode of formation than the well combined employment of the different arms which will give the victory; I except from it, nevertheless, columns too deep, which should be proscribed by all theories.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3100"/>We will terminate this dissertation by recalling, that <num value="1">one</num> of the most essential points for conducting infantry to the combat, is to secure our troops from the fire of the enemy's artillery as much as possible; not in withdrawing them unseasonably, but by profiting by the inequalities of the ground, or other accidents which are found before them, in order to shelter them from the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>When we have arrived under the fire of musketry, then shelters are not to be calculated upon; if we be in condition to assail, we must do so; shelters are suitable only, in this case, for skirmishers and for defensive troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>It is sufficiently important, generally, to defend villages which are upon the front, or to seek to carry them if we be the assailant; but it is equally necessary not to attach an undue importance thereto, forgetting the famous battle of Hochstaedt: <placeName key="tgn,2050078" n="1.000 4" reg="marlborough, middlesex county, massachusetts">Marlborough</placeName> and <persName><foreName>Eugene</foreName></persName> seeing the bulk of the <orgName n="French infantry" type="infantry">French infantry</orgName> buried in the villages, forced the centre and took <num value="24">twenty-four</num> battalions, sacrificed to guard those posts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>For the same reason it is useful to occupy clumps of trees or copses, which may give a support to that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> parties which is the master of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>They shelter the troops, conceal their movements, protect those of the cavalry, and hinder that of the enemy from acting in their proximity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>The skeptic <rs>Clausewitz</rs> was not afraid to sustain the contrary maxim, and under the singular pretext that he who occupies a wood acts blindly, and discovers nothing of what the enemy is doing, he presents their defense as a fault of tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>Blinded himself, probably, by the results of <pb id="p.305" n="305"/>the battle of <placeName reg="Hohenlinden, Oberbayern, Bayern" key="tgn,7004654">Hohenlinden</placeName>, the author is too prone to confound here the occupation of a wood in the line of battle with the fault of throwing a whole army in a vast forest without being master of the issues, either of the front or of the flanks; but he must never have seen a combat who denies the incontestable importance of the possession of a wood situated in proximity with a line that he wishes to defend or attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>The part which the park <rs>Hougeumont</rs> played in the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs> is a great example of the influence that a post well chosen and well defended can have in a combat; in advancing his paradox, <persName n="Clausewitz,,M.,,," id="n0051.0009.00305.00847" reg="default:Clausewitz,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Clausewitz</surname></persName> had forgotten the importance which woods had in the battles of Hochkirch and of Kollin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>But we have already dwelt too long upon this chapter of the infantry, it is time to speak of other arms.

<head>Article <num value="45">XLV</num>: the cavalry.</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>The formation of the cavalry, subjected to nearly the same controversies as that of the infantry, has been subjected also to the same uncertainty, and the too much vaunted treatise of the <rs>Count de Bismark</rs>, has not done much to clear them up. As we have been scarcely better settled upon its employment, I shall be permitted to submit what I think of it to the decision of generals habituated to conducting it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>The employment which a general should make of cavalry, naturally depends a little on the relative strength of that of the enemy, either in number or in quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>Nevertheless, whatever modification those variations may induce, a cavalry inferior, but well conducted, may always find occasions to do great things, so decisive is the proper moment in the employment of this arm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>The numerical proportion of the cavalry to the infantry has much varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>It depends upon the natural disposition of nations, whose inhabitants are more or less fit to make good horsemen; the abundance and the quality of the horses also exercise a certain influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>In the wars of the revolution, the <rs>French</rs> cavalry, though disorganized, and very inferior <pb id="p.306" n="306"/>to that of the <name>Austrians</name>, served marvellously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>I saw, in <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct>, in the army of the <rs>Rhine</rs>, what they pompously called the reserve of cavalry, and which formed scarcely a feeble brigade, (<num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> horses.) <measure n="10years" type="date">Ten years</measure> afterwards I saw those same reserves <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> horses strong, so much had ideas and means changed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>As a general thing, we may admit that an army in the field ought to have a <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> of its force in cavalry; in mountainous countries, a <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> is sufficient.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>The principal merit of the cavalry lies in its rapidity and its mobility; we might add even in its impetuosity, if it were not feared to see a false application made of the last quality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>However important it may be in the ensemble of the operations of a war, the cavalry could not defend a position without the assistance of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>Its principal object is to prepare or to finish the victory, to render it complete by taking prisoners and trophies, by pursuing the enemy, by rapidly carrying succor to a menaced point, by breaking the shaken infantry, finally by covering the retreats of the infantry and the artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>This is why an army, wanting in cavalry, rarely obtains great successes, and why its retreats are so difficult.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>The mode and the moment most suitable for engaging the cavalry, belongs to the <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> of the chief, to the plan of battle, to what the enemy is doing; and to a <num value="1000">thousand</num> combinations too numerous to mention here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>We shall indicate then their principal features.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>It is acknowledged that a general attack of cavalry against a line in good order, could not be attempted with success unless sustained by infantry and much artillery, at least at a certain distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>It was seen at <placeName key="tgn,7008022;tgn,2005702;tgn,2072981;tgn,2753461;tgn,2035847;tgn,7013137" n="0.004 000000.2318	placename;tgn,7008022;waterloo,brabant,wallonie,belgie,europe,Brabant,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe;0.004 000000.2040	placename;tgn,2005702;waterloo, lauderdale, alabama,Lauderdale,Alabama,United States,North and Central America;0.002 000000.0816	placename;tgn,2072981;waterloo, seneca, new york,Seneca,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0680	placename;tgn,2753461;waterloo, fauquier, virginia,Fauquier,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0680	placename;tgn,2035847;waterloo, black hawk, iowa,Black Hawk,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,7013137;waterloo,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="waterloo,brabant,wallonie,belgie,europe,Brabant,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe;waterloo, lauderdale, alabama,Lauderdale,Alabama,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, seneca, new york,Seneca,New York,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, fauquier, virginia,Fauquier,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, black hawk, iowa,Black Hawk,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;waterloo,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Waterloo</placeName> how much it cost the <rs>French</rs> cavalry for having acted against this rule, and the cavalry of <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> experienced the same fate at Kunersdorf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>We may, nevertheless, find ourselves called upon to engage the cavalry alone; but, in general, a charge upon a line of infantry which should already be found engaged with the adverse infantry, is that from which we could expect the most advantages; the battles of <placeName key="tgn,2035190;tgn,2028962" n="0.008 000000.0680	placename;tgn,2035190;marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0544	placename;tgn,2028962;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America" reg="marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America">Marengo</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Borodino, Tverskaya Oblast', Rossiya" key="tgn,7010116">Borodino</placeName>, and <num value="10">ten</num> others, have proved this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>Meanwhile there is a case in which the cavalry has a decided superiority over infantry; it is when there falls a beating rain or snow, which wets the arms and deprives the infantry of its fire; the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Augereau,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00306.00848" reg="mostcommon:Augereau,nomatch:0"><surname>Augereau</surname></persName></orgName> had a cruel proof of it at <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>, and the left of the <name>Austrians</name> experienced the same fate at <placeName key="tgn,7004455;tgn,2098870;tgn,1014721" n="0.072 000000.6487	placename;tgn,7004455;dresden,dresden,sachsen,deutschland,europe,Dresden,Sachsen,Deutschland,Europe;0.010 000000.0868	placename;tgn,2098870;dresden, weakley, tennessee,Weakley,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0124	placename;tgn,1014721;dresden,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="dresden,dresden,sachsen,deutschland,europe,Dresden,Sachsen,Deutschland,Europe;dresden, weakley, tennessee,Weakley,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America;dresden,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">Dresden</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/>Great charges are also executed with success against infantry, when <pb id="p.307" n="307"/>we should have already succeeded in shaking it by a fearful fire of artillery, or in any other manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>Great charges are made for carrying the batteries of the enemy, and facilitating for the masses of infantry the means of crowning his position; then it is necessary that the infantry be in condition to sustain them without delay, for a charge of this nature has but an instantaneous effect, of which it is necessary to profit briskly before the enemy drive back your cavalry disunited.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>Finally, general charges are made against the enemy's cavalry for driving it from the field of battle and returning afterwards against his battalions with more liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>The cavalry could be launched with success for taking the hostile line in flank or in reverse, at the moment of a serious attack, which the infantry should execute in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>If it be repulsed, it can return at a gallop, and be rallied upon the army; if it succeed, it may cause the ruin of the hostile army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>It is rare that it is given this destination, and I do not see, nevertheless, what obstacle there could be to it, for cavalry well conducted could not be cut off, even when it should find itself in rear of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>For the rest, this is the part which belongs especially to irregular cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>In the defensive, the cavalry can equally obtain immense results, by engaging at the proper moment a hostile body of troops, which, having approached the line should be ready to penetrate it, or which should already have pierced it; it could in this case re-establish affairs, and cause the destruction of an adversary shaken and disunited even by its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> successes; a fine charge of the <name>Russians</name> at <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>, and the <rs>English</rs> cavalry at <placeName key="tgn,7008022;tgn,2005702;tgn,2072981;tgn,7013137;tgn,2753461;tgn,2035847" n="0.004 000000.2355	placename;tgn,7008022;waterloo,brabant,wallonie,belgie,europe,Brabant,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe;0.004 000000.1860	placename;tgn,2005702;waterloo, lauderdale, alabama,Lauderdale,Alabama,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0744	placename;tgn,2072981;waterloo, seneca, new york,Seneca,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,7013137;waterloo,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,2753461;waterloo, fauquier, virginia,Fauquier,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,2035847;waterloo, black hawk, iowa,Black Hawk,Iowa,United States,North and Central America" reg="waterloo,brabant,wallonie,belgie,europe,Brabant,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe;waterloo, lauderdale, alabama,Lauderdale,Alabama,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, seneca, new york,Seneca,New York,United States,North and Central America;waterloo,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;waterloo, fauquier, virginia,Fauquier,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, black hawk, iowa,Black Hawk,Iowa,United States,North and Central America">Waterloo</placeName> proved this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>Finally, the especial cavalry of the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> make timely charges, either for favoring an attack, or for profiting from a false movement of the enemy, or in order to finish his defeat in a retrograde movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>It is not so easy to determine the best mode of attack, it depends upon the object that is proposed, and other circumstances which have an influence upon the choice of the moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>There are <num value="4">four</num> modes of charging <pb id="p.308" n="308"/>in columns at distance, in lines at the trot,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/> 
<p>When I speak here of charges in lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>there is no contradiction with what I have advanced elsewhere; it is comprehended that the question here is not great deployed lines, but brigades, or divisions, at the most.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>A corps of several divisions will form upon the ground in several echelon columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>the head of which for each will be <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> regiments deployed for the charge.</p></note> in lines at the gallop, finally at a helter-skelter, (<hi rend="italics">a la debandade</hi>:) all may be employed with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>In the charge <hi rend="italics">en muraille</hi> or in line, the lance offers incontestable advantages; in melees, the sabre is better, perhaps: hence comes the idea of giving the lance to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rank which is to break, and the sabre to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, which is to finish by partial struggles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>The firing with the pistol is suited only to advanced posts in a charge as foragers, or when the light cavalry wishes to harrass the infantry and draw its fire, in order to favor a more serious charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>As for carbine firing, we scarcely know what it is good for, since it requires the whole troop to halt in order to fire deliberately, which will expose it to a certain defeat if it be attacked boldly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>It is skirmishers only who are able to fire running.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>We have just said that all the modes of charging could be equally good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>Meanwhile it is necessary to guard against believing that impetuosity is always decisive in a shock of cavalry against cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>The fast trot on the contrary appears to me the best gait for charges in line, because here everything depends upon harmony, steadiness and order, conditions which we do not find in charges at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>Those are suitable especially in charges against artillery, because it is more important to arrive quickly than to arrive in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>For the same reason, with cavalry armed with sabres, we may throw ourselves at a gallop at <num value="200">two hundred</num> paces against a hostile line which awaits us steadily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>But if we have a cavalry armed with lances, the fast trot is the true gait, for the advantage of this arm depends above all upon the preservation of order; as soon as there is a melee, the lance loses all its value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>When the enemy comes upon you at a fast trot, it does not seem prudent to run upon him at a gallop, for you arrive all disunited against a compact and close mass, which will pass through your disjointed squadrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3158"/>There would only be the moral effect produced by the apparent audacity of your charge which would be favorable to you; but if the enemy appreciate it at its just value you will be lost, for in the physical and natural order, success ought to be for the compact mass against horsemen galloping without harmony.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>In charges against infantry, the <name>Mamelukes</name> and the <name>Turks</name> have sufficiently proved the importance of impetuosity; where the lancers or the <pb id="p.309" n="309"/>cuirassiers at the trot will not penetrate, no cavalry will pierce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3160"/>It is only against infantry much shaken, or whose fire could not be kept up, that the impetuous charge can have any advantange over the trot.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>and those squadrons were indeed overwhelmed at a slow trot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>As for the rest, personal bravery has more influence upon shocks and melees than the different gaits; the full gallop has against it only, the leading to dispersion and the change of the shock into a melee, which can be avoided with the char ges at a trot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3165"/>On the other hand the much talked of momentum, the only advantage of the gallop, is but a phantom to frighten inexperienced troopers.</p></note> In order to force good squares, cannon and lancers are necessary, better still cuirassiers armed with lances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3166"/>For charges as foragers or helter-skelter, so frequent in the daily recounters, it is necessary to imitate the <name>Turks</name> or the <name>Cossacks</name>: these are the best examples that can be taken: we shall return to this subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3167"/>Whatever system is employed for going to the shock, a recognized truth for all possible charges is, that <num value="1">one</num> of the best means of succeeding is to know how to throw at the proper time some squadrons on the flanks of the enemy's line which is to be assailed in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3168"/>But in order that this manoeuvre should obtain a full success, in charges of cavalry against cavalry especially, it is necessary that it be executed only at the instant when the lines come to be engaged, for a minute too soon or too late the effect would probably be nothing: thus it is that the greatest merit of an officer of cavalry consists in this exact and rapid <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3169"/>The armament and the organization of cavalry have been the subject of many controversies, which it would be easy to reduce to a few truths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3170"/>The lance is, as has just been said the offensive arm for a troop of horsemen charging in line, for it attains an enemy that could not approach them; but it may be well to have a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rank or a reserve armed with sabres, more easy to handle when in a meee, and when the ranks cease to be united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3171"/>Perhaps it would even be better still to cause a charge of lancers to be sustained by an echelon of hussars, who penetrating the hostile line after them, would better finish the victory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3172"/>The cuirass is the defensive arm <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>. The lance, and the cuirass of strong leather doubled, or a buffalo hide, seems to me the best armament for the light cavalry; the sabre and the iron cuirass for that the heavy cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>Some experienced military men incline even to arming the cuirassiers with lances, persuaded that such a cavalry, very similar to <pb id="p.310" n="310"/>the ancient men at arms, would overturn all before it. It is certain that a lance would suit them better than the musketoon, and I do not see what should prevent giving them weapons similar to those of the light cavalry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>With regard to the amphibious troop, dragoons, opinion will ever be divided; it is certain that it would be useful to have some battalions of mounted infantry, which could anticipate the enemy at a defile, to defend it in retreat, or to scour a wood; but to make cavalry of infantry, or a soldier who would be equally proper for either arm, appears a difficult thing: the fate of <name>French</name> foot dragoons would seem to have sufficiently proved it, if on the other side the <name>Turkish</name> cavalry had not fought with the same success on foot as on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>It has been said that the greatest inconvenience of dragoons arises from the circumstance that you are obliged to preach to them in the morning that a square cannot resist their charges, and to teach them in the evening that a footman armed with a gun ought to overcome all possible horsemen: this argument is more specious than true, for instead of preaching to them maxims so contradictory, it would be more natural to tell them, that if brave horsemen can break a square, brave infantry can also repulse that charge; that the victory does not depend always upon the superiority of the arm, but rather upon a <num value="1000">thousand</num> circumstances; that the courage of the troops, the presence of mind of the chiefs, a seasonably made manoeuvre, the effect of the artillery and the fire of musketry, the rain, the mud even, have contributed to checks or successes; but that in general, a brave man on foot or on horseback ought to beat a poltroon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>By inculcating these truths to dragoons, they will be able to believe themselves superior to their adversary, either when employed as infantry or when charging as horsemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>It is thus that the <name>Turks</name> and Circassians act, whose cavalry often dismount to right in the woods or behind a shelter gun in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>Meanwhile, it cannot be concealed, good chiefs and good soldiers are necessary to carry the education of a troop to that degree of perfection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>However that may be, a regiment of dragoons attached to each <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee</hi> of infantry or cavalry, as well as to an advanced or <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, could be very useful; whilst that forming whole divisions of dragoons is reducing them to the impossibility of being employed as infantry in the small number of unexpected cases where that would become necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>It would then be better to make lancers of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>All that has been said in respect to the formation of infantry may be applied to the cavalry, saving the following modifications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/><num value="1">1</num>. Lines deployed checkerwise, or in echelon are much more suitable to cavalry than full lines; whilst that in the infantry the order deployed <hi rend="italics">en</hi> <pb id="p.311" n="311"/><hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiquier</hi> would be too broken, and dangerous if cavalry changed to penetrate and take the battalions in flank; the disposition <hi rend="italics">en &eacute;chiquier</hi> is sure only for preparatory movements previous to the contact with the enemy, or for lines in columns of attack able to defend themselves alone in every direction against cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>Whether we form the <hi rend="italics">echiquier</hi>, or prefer full lines, the distance between the lines ought to be sufficiently great in order that they should not reciprocally drag each other on in case of a check, in view of the rapidity with which they are rallied if the charge is unfortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>It is merely well to observe that, in the echiquier, the distance may be less than in the full line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>In no case, could the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line be full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>It ought to be formed in columns by divisions, or at least to leave in it openings for <num value="2">two</num> squadrons which we ploy in columns on the flanks of each regiment, in order to facilitate the passage of the troops rallied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/><num value="2">2</num>. In the order in columns of attack upon the centre, the cavalry should be by regiments, and the infantry only by battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>To comply well with this order, regiments of <num value="6">six</num> squadrons are then necessary, in order that in ploying upon the centre by divisions they may be able to form <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>If they have only <num value="4">four</num> squadrons, they would then only form <num value="2">two</num> lines.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/><num value="3">3</num>. The column of attack of cavalry should never be compact like that of infantry, but at full or half squadron distance, with a view to having ground for separating and charging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>This distance is only intended for troops thrown out to combat; when they are in repose behind the line they can be closed together in order to cover less ground and to diminish the space which they would have to pass over in order to engage, provided, nevertheless, that those masses shall be under shelter or out of reach of cannon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/><num value="4">4</num>. An attack on the flank being more to be feared in cavalry than in a combat of infantry against infantry, it is necessary to establish, upon the extremities of a line of cavalry, some squadrons in echelon by platoons, in order that they be able to form, by a right wheel or a left wheel against the enemy who should come to disturb the flank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/><num value="5">5</num>. For the same motive it is essential, as has already been said, to know how to throw seasonably some squadrons upon the flanks of a line or cavalry which we are about to attack; if there be irregular cavalry present, it is especially for that we ought to use it in the combat, because for this use it is worth as much and perhaps more than the regular.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>An important observation also is that, in the cavalry especially, it is <pb id="p.312" n="312"/>well that the commander-in-chief extend in depth rather than in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>For example, in a division of <num value="2">two</num> brigades which should deploy, it would not be expedient that each brigade should form a single line behind the other, but rather that each brigade should have a regiment in <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line, and <num value="1">one</num> in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>: thus each unit of the line will have its own reserve behind it, an advantage which cannot be misunderstood, for events pass so quickly in charges, that it is impossible for a general officer to be master of <num value="2">two</num> deployed regiments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>It is true that in adopting this mode each general of brigade will have the disposition of his reserve, and that it would be well, nevertheless, to have <num value="1">one</num> for the whole division; for this reason it is believed that <num value="5">five</num> regiments for a division is very suitable for cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>If it is wished to engage in line by brigades of <num value="2">two</num> regiments, the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> serves as general reserve behind the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>If it is wished, we may also have <num value="3">three</num> regiments in line, and <num value="2">two</num> in column behind each wing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>Is it preferred, on the contrary, to take a mixed order by deploying but <num value="2">two</num> regiments at a time, keeping the remainder in column, in this case, we have also a suitable order, since <num value="3">three</num> regiments formed by divisions behind the line cover the flanks and the centre, at the same time leaving intervals for passing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line if it is beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>(See fig. <num value="10">10</num>, plate <num value="3">3</num>.)</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/><num value="2">Two</num> essential maxims are generally admitted for combats of cavalry against cavalry : the <num value="1">one</num> is, that every <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line ought to be sooner or later led back, for, in the supposition even that it should have made the most fortunate charge, it is probable that the enemy, by opposing to it fresh squadrons, will force it to rally behind the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>The other maxim is, that with equal merit in the troops and chiefs, the victory will remain to him who shall have the last squadrons in reserve, and who shall know how to launch them at the proper moment upon the flanks of the hostile line, already engaged with his.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>It is upon these <num value="2">two</num> truths we shall be able to form a just idea of the system of formation most suitable for conducting a heavy body of cavalry to the combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>Whatever order may be adopted, it is necessary to guard against deploying large bodies of cavalry in full lines; for they are masses difficult to handle, and if the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is driven back, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> will be dragged along with it without being able to draw a sabre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>To the number of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> proofs that the late war has give us of this, we will cite the attack executed by Nansouty in columns by regiments, upon the <name>Prussian</name> cavalry deployed in advance of Chateau-<persName n="Thierry,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00312.00853" reg="mostcommon:Thierry,nomatch:0"><surname>Thierry</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>For the rest, in cavalry more still than in the infantry, the moral ascendancy does a great deal; the <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">sang froid</hi> of the chief, the intelligence and bravery of the soldier, whether in the melee, or for rallying, procure victory oftener than such or such another formation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/> 
<p>When I speak of the excellent <name>French</name> cavalry, I mean to speak of its impetuous bravery, and not of its perfection; for it does not approach the <rs>Russian</rs> or the <name>German</name> cavalry, either in equitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>in organization, or in the care of its horses.</p></note> but we must not be deceived, and think that it would be possible to execute the same things with disciplined light cavalry, which we should launch as foragers against squadrons well united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>It is the constant habit of moving in disorder which causes irregular troops to know how to direct all their individual efforts towards a common end; the best exercised hussars will never approach to the natural instinct of the <rs>Cossack</rs>, of the <name>Tscherkes</name> or of the <name>Turk</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>If experience has proved that irregular charges may bring about the defeat of the best cavalry in partial combats, it is necessary to acknowledge also the impossibility of counting upon helter-skelter charges in <pb id="p.314" n="314"/>pitched battles, upon which depends often the fate of a whole war. Such a charge could without doubt aid an attack in lines) but alone it would produce nothing important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>We ought then to consider those irregular charges as a powerful auxiliary in the daily rencounters of cavalry, and as a useful accessory in decisive shocks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>From all that which precedes, we ought to conclude, in my opinion, that for battles, a regular cavalry, furnished with long arms, and for petty warfare, an irregular cavalry armed with excellent pistols, with lances and with sabres, will ever be the best organization for this important branch of the service of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>For the rest, whatever system we adopt it appears not less incontestable that a numerous cavalry, whatever be its nature, ought to have a great influence upon the results of a war; it can carry to a distance terror into the ranks of the enemy; it captures convoys, blockades the army, thus to speak, in its positions; renders its communications difficult, if not impossible; disturbs all harmony in its enterprises and in its movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>In a word it procures almost the same advantages as a rising in mass of the people, by carrying confusion upon the flanks and upon the rear of an army, and by making it impossible for its general to calculate anything with certainty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>Every organization, then, which should tend to double the strength of the cavalry, in case of war, by incorporating militia into it, would be a good system; for those militia, aided by a few good squadrons, will be able at the end of some months' campaign, to make good partizans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>Without doubt those militia will not have all the qualities which the warlike and wandering populations possess who pass, thus to speak, their lives on horseback, and whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instincts are those of petty warfare; but they will supply them in part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>In this respect <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 6" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> has a great advantage over all her neighbors, as much by the number and quality of her horses of the <rs>Don</rs>, as by the nature of the irregular militia which she can raise at a moments' warning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>The following is what I wrote <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago in Chapter <num value="35">35</num> of the <name>Treatise</name> of Grand Military Operations, upon this same subject:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<p>The immense advantages which the <name>Cossacks</name> have given to the <rs>Russian</rs> armies are incalculable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>Those light troops, insignificant in the shock of a great battle, (unless it be for falling upon the flanks,) are terrible in the pursuit and in a war of posts; this is the most redoubtable enemy for all the combinations of a general, because he is never sure of the arrival and execution of his orders, his convoys are always exposed, <pb id="p.315" n="315"/>and his operations uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>So long as an army has a few half regular regiments of them, their whole utility is not recognized; but when the number of them is increased to <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>, their importance is felt, especially in countries where the people are not hostile to them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>We are never certain of making a tranquil march, because we know not where our enemies are; these labors require considerable forces, and the regular cavalry is soon rendered unserviceable by fatigues which it is not able to sustain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>For the rest, I believe that hussars or volunteer lancers, raised or organized at the moment of the war, well conducted, and moving where bold chiefs conduct them at their will, would accomplish nearly the same object; but it is necessary to regard them as independent, for if they were to receive orders from the headquarters, they would no longer be partizans.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>I would not terminate this article without noticing the by far too passionate attacks of which it has been the object on the part of <persName n="Bismark,General,,,," id="n0051.0009.00315.00858" reg="mostcommon:Bismark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bismark</surname></persName>, and with which, unfortunately, I have become acquainted too late for replying to them as I ought to do. The passage which seems to have especially excited his wrath, is that in which I have advanced, after many others, that cavalry could not defend a position by itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>The General, who doubtless pretends that cavalry can make war of itself alone, and that it could hold a position quite as well as infantry, thinks to justify such sophisms in going for examples even to the war of <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00315.00859" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> upon the <name>Ticino</name>, as if musketry, shells and grape shot had brought about no change in the employment of this arm!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>Proud of his equestrian erudition, he treats as ignorant all who do not think like him. <pb id="p.316" n="316"/>Without being a Seydlitz or a Lagueriniere, <num value="1">one</num> may very well reason upon the employment of cavalry in war, and although I have no pretension to being a trooper, I can say that the most experienced of generals in our day have partaken of my ideas upon the cavalry, and that in many battles I have often judged of it better than those who have commanded large masses of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>The only <num value="1">one</num> of my maxims which has excited some controversies, is that relative to the gait of the trot for charges against cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>Whatever may have been said of it, I believe still, at the moment at which I am writing, that success depends much upon the maintenance of order until the instant of the shock; and that for lancers especially, the shock of a <hi rend="italics">mass well in hand</hi> and at the trot, would triumph over a troop scattered by the gallop.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>As for the rest, to maintain order as much as possible in the shock, to endeavor to have it seconded at the opportune moment by a flank attack; to be able to give moral impulsion to <num value="1">one</num>'s troop, and to have an echelon ready for support, are the only elements of success which I have ever recognized as practicable in the charges of cavalry against cavalry, for all the fine maxims in the world vanish in a struggle rapid as the lightning, where the most skillful professors would only have time to parry sabre cuts, without even being in condition to give an order which could be heard and executed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>With regard to the good employment of the cavalry, in the whole of a battle as in that of the whole of a war, I believe that no experienced general would repudiate the ideas which I have advanced upon this subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>I have never denied that cavalry would not concur in the defense of a position; but that it would defend it by itself, I shall ever deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>Posted on a position, behind a <num value="100">hundred</num> pieces of artillery, it will be able to maintain itself there if <num value="1">one</num> be contented with cannonading it, as the <rs>French</rs> cavalry so bravely defended itself at <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Eylau</placeName>; but let infantry and artillery march upon it after having paralyzed its batteries, and you will see if the position will be defended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>For the rest, the true cause of the great wrath of General B**** is easy to divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>I have had the imprudence to say that his Treatise upon the <name>Cavalry</name>, albeit very erudite, had not caused much progress to be made in this arm. This judgment has doubtless appeared to him severe, and in spite of the wrongs of the author in regard to myself, I agree that it was pronounced in too absolute a manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>Meanwhile, after the teachings we have been able to receive from the cavalry of Seydlitz and <pb id="p.317" n="317"/>of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00317.00860" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, I do not know whether that which M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>For having dared to resolve it negatively, I am but an ignoramus; there is good criticism for you!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>When wit sparkles and the passions speak, reason and judgment sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>As for the rest, I have already observed in the notice which precedes this work, that it was not in serious books that a military man ought to reply to personalities especially after having been ignorant of them for <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>. <milestone unit="hr"/> </p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>The artillery is at the same time an offensive and defensive arm, equally formidable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>As an offensive means, a great battery, well employed, crushes a hostile line, shakes it, and facilitates to the troops which attack it the means of breaking it. As a defensive arm, it must be acknowledged that it doubles the strength of a position, not only by the harm it does an enemy from afar, and by the moral effect which it produces at a long distance upon troops which march to the attack, but yet by the local defense which it will make of the position itself, and within grape shot range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>It is not less important in the attack and defense of places, or of intrenched camps, for it is the soul of modern fortification.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>We have said a few words upon its distribution in the line of battle, but we are more embarrassed in speaking of the mode in which it should be made to act in combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>Here the chances multiply in such a manmer, by reason of the particular circumstances of the affair, of the ground and of the movements of the enemy, that we cannot say that the artillery has any action independent of that of the other arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>In the meanwhile we have seen <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00317.00861" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName> throw a battery of a <pb id="p.318" n="318"/><num value="100">hundred</num> pieces in the gap occasioned in his line by the departure of the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Massena,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00318.00862" reg="mostcommon:Massena,nomatch:0"><surname>Massena</surname></persName></orgName>, and thus to hold in check all the efforts of the <name>Austrian</name> centre; but it would be very dangerous to set up as a maxim such an employment of the artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>We shall limit ourselves then to presenting here a few fundamental data, observing that they are based upon the condition of this arm, such as it existed in the late wars; the employment of the new discoveries not being yet well determined could not find place here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/><num value="1">1</num>. In the offensive, we ought to unite a certain mass of artillery upon the point where we are preparing to direct our heaviest blows; we will employ it at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for shaking by its fire the hostile line, in order to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> the attack of the infantry and cavalry.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/><num value="4">4</num>. Batteries, although spread in general over the whole of a defensive line, ought to know how to direct their attention upon the point where the enemy would find more advantages and facilities to penetrate; it is necessary then that the general commanding the artillery should know the strategic and the tactical point of a field of battle, as well as the ground itself, and that every distribution of the reserves be calculated upon this double data.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/><num value="5">5</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>No person is ignorant, either, that the concentric fire is the most suitable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/><num value="6">6</num>. Artillery of every kind employed in battles ought never to forget that its principal destination is to batter the troops of the enemy, and not to reply to his batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>Meanwhile, as it is well not to leave the field free to the action of the hostile artillery, it is useful to combat it for drawing its fire; <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of the disposable pieces may be destined to that object, but <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> at least ought to be directed upon the cavalry and the infantry.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>The pamphlet of <persName n="Okounieff,General,,,," id="n0051.0009.00321.00867" reg="nearbymention:Okounieff,M.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Okounieff</surname></persName> would then have already attained an important end in in opening this vast quarry; but after having rendered him justice, I shall be permitted to say that the author has rather overstepped the mark, for if it were necessary to believe all he advances, there would no longer, be required in an army anything but cuirassiers, artillerists, and the infantry necessary for holding enclosed posts, for the rest would be but food for projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>Setting out with this dominant idea, <persName n="Okounieff,,M.,,," id="n0051.0009.00321.00868" reg="default:Okounieff,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Okounieff</surname></persName> concludes from it by a very natural consequence, that the means of gaining battles will be reduced to breaking the centre of an army by dint of cannon shots, and in having masses prepared to fall upon this breach; a means which he finds very preferable to those he calls <hi rend="italics">movements of conversion</hi>, and which to this day, according to his own confession, have gained very many battles.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>Here, I own, I am obliged to contend that there is something too absolute in these assertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>In the first place, I do not perfectly comprehend <pb id="p.322" n="322"/>those movements of conversion; they are doubtless attacks for outflanking a wing at the same time that a part of the front is assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>If I am not deceived, these kinds of manoeuvres are not always movements of conversion; at best it is but a quarrel of definition, which is really of little importance; that which I do not consider well founded, is the idea that an exclusive manoeuvre can be adopted as an universal panacea, and that it is necessary to renounce all other tactics than that of immense batteries and heavy masses piercing centres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>For my part, if I had to combat an enemy professing such exclusive ideas, I should be no wise embarrassed in opposing to him means which would defeat his favorite attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I should employ that which <persName n="Okounieff,,M.,,," id="n0051.0009.00322.00869" reg="default:Okounieff,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Okounieff</surname></persName> himself cites on <ref n="page 35">page 35</ref>, as having been adopted with success by the <rs>Prince de Lichtenstein</rs> at the <rs n="Battle of Wagram" type="battle">battle of Wagram</rs>, against the famous column of <persName n="Macdonald,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00322.00870" reg="mostcommon:Macdonald,nomatch:0"><surname>Macdonald</surname></persName>; the system employed at <placeName reg="Bagrationovsk, Kaliningrad, Rossiya" key="tgn,7018019">Cannae</placeName> by <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00322.00871" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>, could all the better find here its application, as such a mass battered by the concentric fires of an artillery equal in number, and disposed in a concave line, like that of the <name>Arch</name>-<persName n="Charles,Duc,,,," id="n0051.0009.00322.00872" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Duc">Duke</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,1004446" n="1.000 10" reg="Essling,Wien,Wien,Osterreich,Europe">Essling</placeName>, would be much compromised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>Finally, in order to avoid cutting the army in <num value="2">two</num> parts, who knows if <num value="1">one</num> of those movements of conversion which the author would repudiate, would not be an excellent means to oppose to his system, since it would transport the decisive effort of the combat on quite another point than the centre?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>Far be the thought from me of contesting all merit in a strong attack upon the centre; I have often recommended it, but especially when it should be combined with an attack upon the extremity of the line (agreeably to figure <num value="12">12</num> of plate <num value="1">1</num>, <ref n="page 210">page 210</ref>,) or where it should be made on a rather too extended line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>Be that as it may, it appears to me that the author has rather lost sight of the fact that the moral of the troops, the character and genius of the chiefs have also a great influence upon the issue of battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>These are batteries less murderous, but not less efficacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>It must not be forgotten either that all fields of battle and all countries do not offer the same advantages to artillery; in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 4" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName>, in Vendee, in many parts of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 4" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, in every very broken country, in a word, we do not find fields of battle like <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipsic</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>As for the rest, there are useful lessons in his pamphlet, to which no other reproach could be made than that of having drawn him from <num value="1">one</num> extreme to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>The author has without doubt wished to imitate those advocates who, after a fine defense, draw exaggerated conclusions certain that the judges will always abate the half of them; wise men <pb id="p.323" n="323"/>will be able to take what they find in them true and useful, and give him credit for them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> result of this treatise should be to awaken the attention of men who have the mission of influencing the destinies of. armies, that is to say, of governments and generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> will be, perhaps, the doubling of the <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> and <hi rend="italics">personal</hi> of the artillery, and the adoption of all improvements capable of augmenting its destructive effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>And as artillerists will be in the number of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victims, it will be very necessary to engage in instructing in the infantry, men chosen to serve the pieces at need, and to fill even the vacancies which battles would leave in the ranks of the artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>Finally, it will be necessary to endeavor to find the means of neutralizing the effects of this carnage, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> which occur seem to be the modification in the armament and the equipment of troops, then the adoption of a new tactics which will render results as prompt as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>This task will be for the rising generation, when we shall have tested by experience all the inventions with which we are occupied in the schools of artillery, whilst awaiting better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>Happy will be those who, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rencounters, shall have a plenty of schrapnel howitzers, many guns charged at the breech, and firing <num value="30">thirty</num> shots a minute; many pieces richocheting at the height of a man, and never failing their mark upon, <num value="1">one</num> or another part of the field of combat; finally, the most improved rockets &mdash; without counting even the famous steam guns of <persName n="Perkins,,,,," id="n0051.0009.00323.00873" reg="mostcommon:Perkins,nomatch:0"><surname>Perkins</surname></persName>, reserved to the defense of ramparts, but which, if the written statement of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Wellington</foreName></persName> is to be believed, will yet be able here to make cruel ravages. * * * What a beautiful text for preaching universal peace and the exclusive reign of railroads!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>I shall be pardoned if I terminate a discussion so grave, by a phrase bordering upon pleasantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>But we must take a less sombre view of the future with which so many brave men menace us, who by a cruel foresight combine the means of rendering war still more bloody than it is, and that, too, in the hope of assuring the triumph of their banners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>A terrible but indispensable emulation, if we would remain on an equality with our neighbors so long as the law of nations shall not have placed limits to those inventions. </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>Several works, and the <name>German</name> particularly, have sounded this bottomless abyss, and have obtained passable results, but by multiplying to infinity examples taken in the small partial combats of the late wars.

<head>Conclusion</head> <milestone unit="hr"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>We have endeavored to retrace the principal points which have appeared to us susceptible of being presented as fundamental maxims of war. War, however, in its ensemble, is not a science, but an art. If strategy, especially, can be subjected to dogmatic maxims which approach the axioms of positive sciences, it is not the same as a whole with the operations of a war, and combats among others will often escape all scientific combinations, to offer us acts essentially dramatic, in which personal qualities, moral inspirations, and a <num value="1000">thousand</num> other causes, will play at times the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>The passions which shall agitate masses, called to hurl themselves against each other &mdash; the warlike qualities of those masses &mdash; the character, energy and the talents of their chiefs &mdash; the greater or less martial spirit, not only of nations, but even of epochs<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/> 
<p>The famous Spanish proverb, <hi rend="italics">he was brave on such a day</hi>, may be applied to nations as well as to individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/><num value="1">One</num> could not compare the <rs>French</rs> at Rosback with those at <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName> nor the <name>Prussians</name> at Prenzlow with those at Dennewitz.</p></note>--in a word, all that which may be called the poetry and the metaphysics of war, will ever have an influence upon its results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>Is it saying, for all that, that there are no tactical rules, and that no tactical theory could be useful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>What reasonable military man would dare pronounce such a blasphemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>Will it be believed that <persName><foreName>Eugene</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Marlborough,,,,," id="n0051.0010.00325.00874" reg="mostcommon:Marlborough,nomatch:0"><surname>Marlborough</surname></persName> have triumphed only by inspiration, or by the moral superiority of their battalions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>Now, when the application of a maxim, and the manoeuvre which has been its result, have a <num value="100">hundred</num> times given the victory to skillful captains, and offer in their favor all the <pb id="p.326" n="326"/>probable chances, will their occasional failure be sufficient for denying their efficacy, and for disputing all influence of the study of the art; will every theory be vain because it will procure but <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the chances of success?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>If the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of an army and of its chiefs have also an influence upon these chances, is it not definitively because it will produce a physical action subjected, like the combination of tactics, to laws common to <hi rend="italics">military statics</hi>? The impetuous attack of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> electrified brave men upon the extremity of a hostile line, will more surely give the victory than the manoeuvre of <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> demoralized men against that same extremity, because the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> will exercise a real action, and the latter will remain passive, if they do not even fly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>Strategy, as we have said, is the art of conducting the greatest part of the forces of an army upon the most important point of the theatre of war, or of a zone of operations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>Tactics is the art of using those masses upon the point where well combined marches will have brought them; that is to say, the art of putting them in action at the moment and at the decisive point of the field of battle upon which the definitive shock is to have place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>When troops think more of flying than of fighting, they are no longer acting masses, in the sense we give to this expression.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>A general instructed in theory, but devoid of <hi rend="italics">coup d'oeil</hi>, of <hi rend="italics">sang froid</hi> and of skill, may make a fine strategic plan, and be at fault in all the laws of tactics, when he finds himself in the presence of the enemy; then his projects will be baffled, and his defeat probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>If he have character, he will be able to diminish the bad consequences of his check; if he lose his wits, he will lose his whole army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>The same general may on the contrary be as good a tactician as he has been strategician, and may have prepared victory by every means in his power; in this case when he shall be ever so little seconded by his troops and lieutenants, he will probably gain a signal victory; but if on the contrary he command but an undisciplined rabble, wanting in order and courage, if he be envied and deceived by perfidious lieutenants,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/> 
<p>It oftener happens than is thought, that a general-in-ehief is deceived by his lieutenants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>who listening but to their egotism, forget that they are betraying at the same time the country and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>through the effect of the basest jealousy and the most contemptible ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>The unskillfulness of a lieutenant, who should be incapable of conceiving the merit of a prescribed manoeuvre, and should commit grave faults of execution, would have the same results in overturning the finest combinations.</p></note> he will doubtless see vanish all his hopes, and his most splendid <pb id="p.327" n="327"/>combinations will be able but to diminish the disasters of an almost inevitable defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>This defeat would be all the more sure when with such instruments he should have to combat an adversary, perhaps less skillful than himself, but having troops inured to war, or enthusiasts for their cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>No tactical system could guarantee the victory when the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of the army is bad, and even when it should be excellent, victory may depend upon an incident like the rupture of the bridges of the <rs>Danube</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,1004446" n="1.000 10" reg="Essling,Wien,Wien,Osterreich,Europe">Essling</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>A systematic general could prohibit columns from adopting the shallow or firing order, or else confine it to purely defensive means, in order to adopt exclusively the semi-profound columns, without being sure, nevertheless of success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>These truths do not prevent the existence of good maxims of war which, with equal chances, will be able to procure victory; and if it be true that these theories could not teach with a mathematical precision what it would be suitable to do in every possible case, it is certain at least that they will always point out the faults that are to be avoided: now this would already be an immense result: for such maxims would thus become, in the hands of generals commanding brave troops, more or less certain pledges of success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>The correctness of this assertion being incontestible, it remains then but to know how to recognize the good maxims from the bad; it is in that, it is true, which consists all genius for war, but there are meanwhile directing principles for arriving at this knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/>Every maxim of war will be good when it shall have for result, the assuring the employment of the largest sum of means of action at the opportune moment and point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>We have presented in chapter <num value="3">III</num>, all the strategic combinations which can lead to this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>As for what concerns the tactical, the principal of those combinations will ever be the choice of the most suitable order of battle, considering the project that shall be had in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>Afterwards, when it comes to the local action of the masses upon the ground, those means of action may be equally well, a charge of cavalry seasonably made, a strong battery posted and unmasked at the proper moment, a column of infantry charging with impetuosity, or a division deployed furnishing, with steadiness and sang-froid, a murderous fire, finally tactical movements which should menace the enemy in flank and reverse, as well as every manoeuvre which should shake the <hi rend="italics">moral</hi> of <num value="1">one</num>'s adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>Each of these acts may, according to circumstances, become the cause of victory; to determine the cases in which it would be necessary to give the preference to either, would be an impossible thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/><pb id="p.328" n="328"/></p> 
<p>In order to play well this great drama of war, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of duties then will be to become well acquainted with the theatre upon which we are to act, to the end of judging of the advantages of the double <hi rend="italics">&eacute;chiouier</hi> upon which the <num value="2">two</num> parties shall move, appreciating the advantages of the enemy as well as those of our own party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>This knowledge acquired, we must consider as to the means of preparing a base of operations; afterwards it will be the object to choose the most suitable zone upon which to direct our principal efforts, and to embrace this zone in a manner the most conformed to the principles of war, by closing well our lines and front of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>The assailing army should especially attach itself to breaking up seriously the hostile army, by adopting to this end skillful objective points of manoeuvre; it will then take for the objective of its enterprises, geographical points proportioned to the successes which it shall have obtained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>The defensive army, on the contrary, should calculate all the means of neutralizing this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impulsion of its adversary, by procrastinating operations, as much as possible without compromising the fate of the country, and by putting off the decisive shock, until the moment when a part of the hostile forces should be found broken down by fatigues, or scattered for occupying the invaded provinces, masking fortifications, covering sieges, protecting the line of operations and the depots, &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>Until then, all that we have just said may be the object of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> plan of operations: but that which no plan could foresee with any certainty, is the nature and issue of the definitive shock which will result from those enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>If your lines of operations have been skillfully chosen, your movements well disguised; if the enemy, on the contrary, make false movements which permit you to fall upon the yet dispersed fractions of his army, you will be able to conquer without pitched battles, by the sole ascendancy of your strategic advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>But if the <num value="2">two</num> parties find themselves in equally good condition at the moment when the rencounter shall have place, then there will result <num value="1">one</num> of those great tragedies like <placeName reg="Borodino, Tverskaya Oblast', Rossiya" key="tgn,7010116">Borodino</placeName>, <placeName reg="Deutsch Wagram, Niederosterreich, Osterreich" key="tgn,7003179">Wagram</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7008022;tgn,2005702;tgn,2072981;tgn,7013137;tgn,2753461;tgn,2035847" n="0.005 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7008022;waterloo,brabant,wallonie,belgie,europe,Brabant,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe;0.004 000000.1860	placename;tgn,2005702;waterloo, lauderdale, alabama,Lauderdale,Alabama,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0744	placename;tgn,2072981;waterloo, seneca, new york,Seneca,New York,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,7013137;waterloo,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,2753461;waterloo, fauquier, virginia,Fauquier,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.0620	placename;tgn,2035847;waterloo, black hawk, iowa,Black Hawk,Iowa,United States,North and Central America" reg="waterloo,brabant,wallonie,belgie,europe,Brabant,Wallonie,Belgie,Europe;waterloo, lauderdale, alabama,Lauderdale,Alabama,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, seneca, new york,Seneca,New York,United States,North and Central America;waterloo,ontario,canada,north and central america,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America;waterloo, fauquier, virginia,Fauquier,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;waterloo, black hawk, iowa,Black Hawk,Iowa,United States,North and Central America">Waterloo</placeName>, Bautzen, and <placeName reg="Dresden, Dresden, Sachsen" key="tgn,7004455">Dresden</placeName>, in which the precepts of grand tactics indicated in Chapter <num value="4">IV</num>, will certainly be able to exercise a notable influence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>It is composed of <num value="32">thirty-two</num> towers, of which <num value="8">eight</num> are on the left bank, with a square fort commanding the <name>Perlingsberg</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>Of the <num value="24">twenty-four</num> towers which are found on the right bank, <num value="7">seven</num> are only half towers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>Those towers are placed, as I have said, in the excavation of a broad and deep ditch, the earth of which has furnished an elevated glacis that places, it is said, the tower secure from direct shots, which I think, nevertheless, difficult for the platform where the artillery is found.</p>
