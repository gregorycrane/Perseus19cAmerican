<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Never was he more serviceable than during a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>The tramp of the prisoners' feet up and down, (there was no room to walk,) as they thus worked for life, was incessantly going on. This black tread-mill of the dungeon could be heard all through the cold and dreary hours of the night.
