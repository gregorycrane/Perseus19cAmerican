<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>The same could be said of his engineering plans and charts, and of his maps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>Some of these efforts possessed considerable merit, and gave evidence of a delicacy of feeling and a fineness of touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>He was so modest, however, that he could not be prevailed upon to submit his poems for publication, and rarely showed them to any but members of the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>New ideas were constantly suggesting themselves, new projects were ever urging to some untried effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>These fields were varied and wide, and related not only to his profession, but to business enterprises of various kinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>Often they were schemes for improving existing conditions or advancing the public welfare; specific improvements in politics and government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>He had many subjects stored away for magazine articles, and would <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> have liked, with a time of leisure, to enter the lecture field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>These topics afforded interesting subjects for conversation when he met with a congenial friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>Many of these were drawn from history, but not all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>The range of his interests was wide, but, as those who knew him well need not be told, his chief interests, aside from his profession, were connected with the subjects of history and the public welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>His public spirit and keen insight into human needs were dominating features of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>He was interested in great public movements for the improvement of the race in all quarters and among all conditions of men. Characterized by sincerity of purpose and disinterestedness, he advocated measures from conviction, and always acted from principle, not for effect or for popularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>He was a man of the highest integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>In connection with his devotion to historical matters, we ought to mention his fondness for looking over old records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>He rarely went on a vacation without choosing some place where there were records which he wished to consult, and a large part of a holiday was spent over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>His literary menu was extensive, and besides history and biography, included travels, scientific researches, archaeological expeditions, a little fiction, and much poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>He loved to read poetry aloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>Upon the legal aspects of his professional endeavor he always entered with a keen zest, whether called upon as an expert witness, or to negotiate, out of court, settlements for damages to estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>Because of his interest in the success of his clients, his keen perception of the drift of the opposing counsel's attack, and his coolness on the witness stand, his services were highly valued, and were not uncommonly sought afterwards by the lawyer or corporation against whom he had happened to be called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Many times he was sought by the other side of the same case, after he had engaged himself to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> comer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>Because of the large number of plans which he had made of our city lots, and his knowledge of their history, a knowledge which went back in many instances to the days of the <q direct="unspecified">Stinted Commons,</q> and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> grants, no <num value="1">one</num> had a better standard of land values.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>The secret of his knowledge in this, as well as in other fields, lay not alone in his excellent memory, but in the painstaking and accurate methods by which he had come at the knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>Partly for this reason, and partly because he was too ready to trust some of those he dealt with, other people often reaped the benefit of his efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/><num value="1">One</num> of his best traits was his desire to think the best of his fellow-men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>He was always ready to take time, even when very busy with important affairs, to help people who came for information or advice; he thus gave freely what had cost him much time and effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>People were constantly seeking such help, not merely his friends, but sometimes entire strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>He has been known to write for people articles or speeches which of course passed as their own compositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>Sometimes he revised other people's writings, often an entire book, but always as an accommodation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>He never asked nor would he have accepted remuneration for such work.
