<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>A sudden enthusiasm for the cause of Negro freedom seized him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Brought up in a strictly conventional and orthodox manner, he was in his youth a Puritan of the <name>Puritans</name>, a firm believer in the infallibility of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and the divine character of the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Gradually, however, doubts crept into his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>He felt instinctively physical combat was beneath the dignity of man. How then could wars be right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>And how could governments which depend upon military power be righteous?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Slavery was an evident fruit of coercion, the very <hi rend="italics">reductio ad absurdum</hi> of it; and yet it was supported by the government, and by its <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> fundamental law, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and it was openly abetted and defended by the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Was it possible to worship institutions which brought forth such harvests?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>By their fruits ye shall know them, and this fruit was rotten to the core.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>And he began to preach a crusade against coercion, and the government which enforced it, and the church which blessed it. Public opinion in <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0009.00056.00183" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s time, and to a lesser degree to-day also, was singularly alike in religious and political matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The pope, a man, had been deposed on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, a writing, set up in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The king, a man, had been dismissed on the other, and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, a writing, enthroned in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The infallibility of the pope had been transferred to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and the majesty of the king to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and protestantism and democracy seemed destined to end in the worship of printer's ink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>What was he to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It was a hard wrench for him.

And the result was that which no prophet has ever escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He was persecuted and hounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>He was called an infidel and blasphemer and Sabbath-breaker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Nor, so far as I know, did he ever use harsh words towards any man to his face, and if he erred in this respect <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> occasionally in his writing, it was because he took the individual as the incarnation of a wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>His constitution was strong, and, so far from suffering from indigestion (which accounts for so much sour criticism of things as they are), he declared that he never knew that he had a stomach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>And yet there was something of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> asceticism about him, for which I do not propose to apologize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>These are real instincts, like that which sends the chick after its food before it is quite free of the egg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> sides to evolution &mdash; that usually dwelt upon, of conformity to environment-and that far more significant <num value="1">one</num> of dissatisfaction with environment, determination to rise above it, and the actual effort against all nature to discover or create a new <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Life means not submission to, but mastery of, environment, and every seed is at heart a rebel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The parts of chaos were well suited to each other and to the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>It was an effort to do the impossible, and it succeeded.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>And men are governed and must be governed by their feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>We are in the habit of talking of logic as if it were superior to sentiment; but all logic starts out from sentiment, and every syllogism can be traced back to a feeling &mdash; a taste &mdash; about which it is not to be disputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Even mathematics, the most logical of sciences, rests upon axioms, and axioms are feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>We say that a straight line is the shortest distance between <num value="2">two</num> points, because we <quote>feel</quote> that it is; and in the same way we believe that <num value="2">two</num> parallel lines can never meet, and that <num value="1">one</num> and <num value="1">one</num> always make <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>But these are all mere feelings, and the new mathematicians are actually arguing to-day that parallel lines can meet, and that our axiomatic feelings are erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Men often think that they are guided by reason, while as a matter of fact they really feel their way; and it is not a bad plan when logic leads you to some act which shocks your feelings, to use these latter as tests of logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>It is this humble, instinctive way of behaving which we call commonsense, <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> and common-sense is the natural corrective of logic-just as when, sailing by right ascension and declination, we see the breakers ahead, we do not hesitate to fall back on the vulgar assistance of the lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>There is no such thing as pure logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>We are always guided either by feeling or by feeling-plus-logic; and hence logic, so far from adding certainty to our conclusions, rather, by bringing in a new element, adds a new possibility of error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The chief use of logic is not to show me what to do, but to afford me a rational excuse for doing what common-sense dictates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>It is not the foundation on which I build my wall, but the prop with which I shore it up when it begins to look shaky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>All the good and all the evil in the world have been caused by feelings, but probably feelings-plus-logic have done more harm in the long run than undiluted feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Logic is relentless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The logic of Torquemada was unanswerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Heretics were damned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>They made converts who were also damned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>For the heart is the root of all, and feeling is the mother of logic, though logic often disowns its mother and endeavors to cut loose from her apron strings, ashamed apparently of its low birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>True logic should be proud of its maternal ancestor, and delight in calling in the good old lady whenever it seems to be coming to grief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>And clearly the idea that logic can independently lay down eternal truths is a fallacy, for the human race is living and growing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Our viewpoints vary and change from day to day. Our feelings are different from those of our fathers, and the logical structure which we rear upon them merely adds to the confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>There is therefore a grain of truth in the common saying that a rule of action is correct in theory but not in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Thus the axiom that it is best to hit a man who differs from you over the head has been fossilized and preserved by the logical institutions <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> founded upon it, into the midst of a period in which men feel instinctively that other less clumsy methods of treatment are better.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Let us beware, however, of imitations and travesties of non-resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>It is no colorless, negative quality, and should have no taint of timidity, no suspicion of effeminacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>Let us be quite sure that we are above violence, and not beneath it. It is far better to fight to the death than to decline the combat from cowardice, whatever may be the name behind which we mask it. A soft answer may, too, be turned into an offense, if the wrong emphasis is placed upon it. An apology <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> should not come too easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>It ought to be a sort of self-punishment which will make me hesitate another time before incurring my own displeasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I have a friend who apologizes at the least provocation-<quote>Oh, yes, to be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>You are quite right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>I am awfully sorry;</quote> and in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> he will be doing the same thing again, and rattling off the same formula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>An over-issue of apologies is like an over-issue of paper dollars; it makes them altogether valueless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The superficial readiness to forgive comes under the same category.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>I once read a letter in which the writer apparently inflicted an injury upon the recipient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>He closed it glibly as follows: <quote>I know you will resent this, but I forgive you freely beforehand.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>Of course, this coin was counterfeit on its face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Forgiveness and apology, from sinned against and sinning, must represent positive sympathy with the other party, or they really become affronts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Forgiveness is a sort of self-blame, too; you blame yourself for not having forgiven before &mdash; for having to forgive at all &mdash; for taking any notice whatever of the offense, and it is the lack of universal sympathy which makes either necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>You find yourself out of tune, like a violin, and you proceed to screw yourself up to the proper pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>The chief use of forgiveness and apology is to the forgiver and apologizer. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>He declared that he would not defend his wife by force in case of an assault, and for such extreme expressions he has been freely criticized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>For my part I do not object to overstatements (if this is <num value="1">one</num>). They have their dramatic value, and carry their cause when a carefully trimmed shaft falls short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>Just as an athlete makes his muscles rigid <num value="1">one</num> at a time, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the right arm and then the left, now the waist muscles and then those of the legs-so mankind may well exercise its various powers to the utmost in turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>The all-round man is the ideal, but until we can produce him we must specialize more or less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>I delight in the strong expression of an idea, from <persName><foreName>Francis</foreName></persName> of Assisi to Nietzsche, <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> for I find the same muscle imperfectly developed in myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Your main duty is to be sincere and to be strong and to pull.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>But I believe that <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0011.00075.00223" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> was right for other reasons than these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>He was conscious of a new moral obligation to refrain from violence of all kinds, and it came to him as an abstract unqualified principle of universal application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>It is of the very nature of moral principles that they transcend present environments and point to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>The fact that they are impracticable is the very source of their strength, for the attempt to apply them tends to transform the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>What dead things our principles would be if we could actually live up to them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>They create and regenerate because they are impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>It is impossible to be perfect in an imperfect environment, and yet it is our duty to be perfect: and this inherent contradiction in the moral world is the reason for the paradoxical character of all great teaching and the guaranty of perpetual improvement in the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Hence we cannot express our <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> obligations in too strong and absolute terms, and the task of whittling them down to suit emergencies emasculates them and renders them useless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>Take the obligation of telling the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Every man feels the beauty of this principle, and yet we know that there are occasions upon which we might utter falsehoods and justify ourselves in so doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>But is it not still true that the act of lying to an armed enemy, for instance, to save the life of a child would be an unpleasant act &mdash; that it would cause us a certain degree of offensethat we would wish to escape the apparent necessity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Is it not difficult to conceive of such a lie on the lips of a Jesus or a Buddha?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>and do we not instinctively take it for granted that they would find some other way out of the dilemma?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>And so with courage and cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Where shall the line between them be drawn?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>At what degree of danger may the brave man be justified in flinching?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Surely there is but <num value="1">one</num> proper rule of action and that is, Never flinch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>Nature will draw the line without our assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>I am convinced that the attempts to delimit and define moral laws of this kind is demoralizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>They will delimit themselves sufficiently in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>We must accept them in their fullest sense, and then practice them as best we can, being assured <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> that the mental perplexity which besets us is a part of the growing pains of the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Not at all that such principles must be accepted as objective, dead, literal laws, but rather as living principles with all the transforming potencies of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The injunction of the <name>Decalogue</name> against slaughter has never been improved upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/><quote>Thou shalt not kill,</quote> said the law-giver, and unloosed a living moral principle &mdash; a seed with infinite possibilities of growth contained in it. It was not understood or applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>It never has been understood or applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>Perhaps it never can be, but therein lies the very secret of its power and immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Morality is not a matter of rules but of tendencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Our own language shows it. (And what wonders of ancient and forgotten wisdom are buried in our language!) <quote>Right</quote> and <quote>wrong</quote> (wrung) mean <quote>straight</quote> and <quote>crooked.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Ethics involve the direction which we take to a goal, and are of necessity relative to us and our present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>The goal should be forever beyond us. <quote><persName n="Hitch,,,,," id="n0159.0011.00077.00224" reg="mostcommon:Hitch,nomatch:0"><surname>Hitch</surname></persName> your wagon to a star.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/><quote>Thou shalt not kill.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Turn your prow that way. Avoid killing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Kill just as little as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It should go against our grain to pull up a weed or cut down a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>And some day when this sense of the sacredness of life has been fully cultivated by the very necessities of slaughter which surround <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> us, we may find ourselves graduated into some sphere in which we may really live and let live, and find in turn some new, inaccessible goal held up before us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>But it is a mistake to assume to behave in accordance with a rigid formula expressing a principle which is still too far beyond us. <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0011.00078.00225" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> felt the full obligation of nonresistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Whether he would have felt it in the case of an attack upon his wife or not, it is impossible to say; but we must not masquerade upon a plane to which we have not yet attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>I would not advise a man to act counter to his best instincts in such a case, but rather to endeavor to cultivate those instincts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>We may be pretty sure that in such a case <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> would not have killed the aggressor, but until we have his spirit we can hardly justify ourselves in adopting his method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The spirit of violence is an evil spirit, and it can only be effectually cast out by the spirit of love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>If we have not that spirit of love which would render acts of violence impossible to us, it is futile to attempt to act as if we had, upon any preconceived intellectual theory of what we should or should not do. The doctrine of non-resistance is not a cold principle to be applied like the rule of <num value="3">three</num> to a mathematical problem, but a living power of the soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>Avoid violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Indulge in it as little as <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Do not worry yourself about any possible exceptions to the rule, but press on toward the goal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>It seems to me that these are the best precepts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>I can recall the case of a man who, following <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0011.00079.00226" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s example, refrained from voting upon the ground that government reposed upon force, and that force was the wrong method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>But after a few years he found that he was trying to live on a plane that was too high for him. Militarism and monopoly were ensconcing themselves ever more securely in the stronghold of office, and his conscience smote him that he did not cast his ballot against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>So he changed his course and began to vote against the wrong, as he conceived it, and for the better &mdash; there being no opportunity to vote for the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>And straightway his conscience left him at peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>He was feeling his way, that was all. He did not deny the validity of the law of nonresistance; only he had not grown up to its full size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>For him to masquerade in its livery, so far as voting was concerned, was a clear case of false pretenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>He was inconsistent, but, as we have seen, life is by its very nature inconsistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The absolute logic of the law was qualified by his own personal contribution of common-sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Logic and common-sense!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Between them is stretched taut the throbbing web and woof of life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>All controversy, <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> conversation, manners and customs, laws, undertakings, progress, labor, craft, art, growth and life issue from their divergence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>If ever they shall coincide, then at last will the words, <quote>It is finished,</quote> be written once for all on the tomb of the universe!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Meanwhile it is our business to strive to bring our common-sense up to the plane of logic, in the blessed certainty that we can never fully succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>We preach logic and practice common-sense, longing for an environment where they may be lost in each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>We must pull our environments along with usa long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together; but to act upon the logical consequences of a rule which we have ceased to feel would leave us out of touch with our environment, disjointed and unrelated, with nothing but a lifeless, unassimilated law to comfort us, which is clearly absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>In the last analysis the secret of sane living is to go on compromising, while shouting, <quote>No compromise!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The would-be abstainer from voting recognized the fact that a perfect man would not vote, but he felt like a hypocrite when he acted like a perfect man, knowing himself to be nothing of the sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The role did not suit him. I ought of course to be perfect, but I must <hi rend="italics">be</hi> perfect before I <hi rend="italics">act</hi> perfect, and it is downright dishonesty to imitate the empty acts of perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/><pb id="p.81" n="81"/></p> 
<p>This matter of abstention &mdash; from voting or violence or anything else-suggests the <num value="2">two</num> opposite ways of regarding any cause directed against any evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>I may have an overwhelming interest in the cause itself, so that I quite forget myself in it. My <num value="1">one</num> effort is to put an end to the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Or I may simply try to wash my hands of it &mdash; to clear my skirts of it-and in my efforts to maintain my personal purity I may neglect altogether the question of the progress of the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Which is the better vegetarian &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> who starves himself to death by sticking to his diet under unfavorable circumstances, thus making himself a living, or rather a dying argument against his principles; or the <num value="1">one</num> who is willing to eat meat for the sake of the cause?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>There is a good deal to be said for the latter individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>And so the non-resistant who votes in the direction of less force may argue that he is doing more for the cause than if he abstained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>He would be right; and the man who had risen to a higher plane and abjured voting would also be right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>At any rate it is difficult to see how <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0011.00081.00227" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s scruples about voting affected his influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>As a matter of fact, they kept him clear of the bootless embarrassments of <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-party politics, and those who separated from him on this issue were soon lost in the crowd <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> who were ready to accept any kind of a substitute for immediate emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>There is a refreshing simplicity in hewing close to the line and in rejecting all temptation to casuistry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>We blame the <rs>Jesuit</rs> writers of <quote>confessional</quote> literature as if they were particularly immoral men; but it was not their fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The task of trying to determine how near a man may come to doing evil without hurting himself is in itself depraving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Without abating a tittle of his beliefs, he threw himself heart and soul into the struggle for emancipation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>In considering that struggle we are brought face to face at once with the anomaly that the cause fathered by a non-resistant was at last achieved by the greatest war of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Does not this dispose of all the claims of the doctrine of abstention from violence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Was not non-resistance impotent until men who believed in bloodshed, gun-powder and cold iron came to its assistance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Is not physical force the true remedy for such evils as slavery after all?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>I think not. <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0012.00085.00232" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> had just <num value="1">one</num> thing to accomplish and that was to make slavery intolerable, and this he succeeded in doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>When it had once become intolerable, it was doomed; but the method of its abolition was a matter of choice in which he was overruled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>He has been blamed from the standpoint of non-resistance because he did not continue to protest against the war, and did not dissociate himself more distinctly from its methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>It has been urged against him that when a young friend who had obtained a commission in the army came to bid him farewell in uniform, <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0012.00085.00233" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> slapped him on the back and wished him <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> Godspeed without a word of disapproval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>If there was any inconsistency in this behavior it was certainly very natural-very humanand he must be indeed a very rigid moralist who would refuse to excuse it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>But his general course during these difficult days seems to me absolutely consistent and praiseworthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>His defense, which we have already considered in another chapter, is impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>He was living among people who did not accept his standards of right and wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>If they chose to fight over an issue which he thought should be settled peaceably, he could not but hope that the side of Abolition would triumph.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Was war the best method of abolishing slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Was his sympathy with the <rs>South</rs> a mistake?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>That depends, I think, on the character of the motives which determined his choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>If it was a kindly feeling for slavery that influenced him, of course it was a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>But it is possible to take another view of the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>In the late fifties and early sixties, the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> hated each other bitterly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>I was brought up in the midst of that hatred and partook of it; and I remember suggesting, as a small boy, when <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0159.0012.00087.00243" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> was captured, that he be taken through the streets of our cities on exhibition in an iron cage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>Here, then, is the ethical proposition: We have <num value="2">two</num> neighbors living in partnership and hating each other with a deadly hatred, and <num value="1">one</num> of them desires to separate peaceably from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>There was no practical difficulty in the way of making a division, for the cleavage ran along geographical lines, and any Master-in-Chancery would have been obliged to report that an actual partition was perfectly feasible.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>What was the psychological condition of the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, that the preference should be given to it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>It was filled with hatred, as we have seen; and, where it did <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> not hate, it was still bent upon having its own way. If we except an inconsiderable number of Abolitionists, the question of slavery did not affect the attitude of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>It was only the <rs>South</rs> that was preoccupied with slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>He called out the troops to maintain the <rs>Union</rs>, and not to abolish slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The slaves were finally freed, as a war measure, to assist the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The war was not designed to help emancipation, but emancipation to help the war. And what was this <quote>Union</quote> for which so many lives were sacrificed and in honor of which so much poetry was written?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>In the last analysis it was the forcible binding together of mutual haters, and its idealization was a curious example of fetish-worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Apart from sentiment, the practical element in the <rs>Union</rs> spirit was the desire to preserve the size of the country; it was devotion to the idea of bigness, and the belief that bigness is a matter of latitude and longitude &mdash; the same spirit which prevailed in the <rs>Mexican</rs> and <rs>Philippine</rs> warsin other words, the spirit of imperialism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>It is impossible of course to extract any moral essence from a mere matter of geographical <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> extension, and it is hardly necessary to point out that the highest civilizations of the past, those of <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florence, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,7013767">Florence</placeName>, were restricted to narrow areas.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>That the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would have suffered from its new commercial isolation cannot be doubted; and that the <name>States</name> of the <name>Confederation</name> would have quarreled is almost equally certain, for hard times make hard tempers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>It is easy to predict, then, that a nation built upon the principle of free secession would not have remained long intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>It is very clear, too, that slavery could not have lasted long along the <rs>Northern</rs> border; for even before the war, with the fugitive-slave law in full operation, a continual stream of escaping slaves found its way across the intervening States to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>If nothing but an ordinary boundary line had separated the slave States from free soil, a general exodus of slaves would have begun, and ere long the border States would of necessity have ceased to be slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>With slavery extinct, the reason for their separation from the <rs>North</rs> would have ceased, and their commercial interests <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> would have demanded reunion with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, while the kindly action of the <rs>North</rs> in permitting them to secede without interference would have left no hostile feelings in their minds to prevent such a reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>With the border States once annexed, a new boundary would have been created along their Southern frontier, and here again history would repeat itself, until the nation was again <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>I do not think that such an outcome of Secession is fanciful, and its realization would have been hastened by the growing impatience of the civilized world with the continuance of chattel-slavery.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>This he regarded as bad for the community which included an unwilling element in its midst, because it was an element of weakness and not of strength; just as a regiment wherein <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the men hate their officers or want to desert will not fight as well as a regiment <quote>at union with itself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>He further regarded it as bad for the element unwillingly included, because, being deprived of liberty, they were apt to direct all their energies to a struggle to be free, instead of along the natural lines of free and peaceful development and progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The relative cheapness or dearness of slave labor had consequently no appreciable effect on Northern labor; and if it had, it is absurd to suppose that Northern capital appreciated the fact or brought about the war for any such reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man who tasted a grain of wild wheat and liked it and proceeded to sow other similar grains was moved as much by fancy as by economic necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>There is a hunger and thirst for knowledge, and a hunger and thirst after <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> righteousness, and many other hungers and thirsts which must all be reckoned with in the study of evolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The exertion of our powers is more or less bounded by our materials, and events which are not economically possible are not likely to happen; but things are not yet in the saddle and the socialist movement, with its devoted and self-forgetful leaders, gives ample proof of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>I put up <num value="1">one</num> afternoon for a few hours at a tiny hotel in a remote village, and a room was assigned to me which had been vacated in haste for my benefit by some more permanent resident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>It bore all the marks of a sitting-room as well as a bedroom, and on the table were lying, <num value="1">one</num> on the other, a couple of books which had evidently been recently laid aside, and each of them contained a book-mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>He gave the sword a shove into the sand and drew back into his wooden chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>I looked with approval on the converted weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>My friends approached him respectfully and without any sign of their customary familiarity, and as he shook hands with them there was a pleasant word for each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>And then in his hearty voice he explained that his train was <measure n="10hours" type="date">ten hours</measure> late and that he must get on to such and such a town that evening, and there was a general giving of advice and telephoning and consulting of timetables until it was proven beyond peradventure that it was impossible for him to proceed until the morrow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>Mankind has always been engaged in this march and perhaps always will be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>Their new wine was too strong for the old bottles, and it always is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Institutions of learning fall into the same category, and their general influence during the years of anti-slavery activity was uniformly reactionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>Almost all the disturbances caused at anti-slavery meetings-frequently ending in personal violence and arson-had the scarcely disguised sympathy of the authorities, and the law was successfully invoked to spread slavery and return the fugitive slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>The leading statesmen and politicians of the country, with hardly a single exception, did what they could for slavery as long as they thought that cause advantageous to their fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>They had substituted paper and ink for their own consciences, and had forgotten the primitive obligations of man in the artificial claims of their oaths of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>This is surely inhuman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>How does a bad law or a bad constitution differ from any other bad thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>We cannot throw the blame for our acts upon parchment and legal-cap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>While a bill is on its passage in the legislature we do not hesitate to charge improper motives against the members, and we often detect log rolling and even bribery and corruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>But when the bill has triumphed over our protests and become a law we straightway fall down on our knees before it. Is not this fetishworship?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>We talk of the majesty of the law as we used to talk of the majesty of our rulers; but the <num value="2">two</num> absurdities must vanish together, for laws are not a whit more majestic than those who make and enforce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>But there was really no dilemma for the honest man. He could at any moment resign his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>We have got rid of the comparatively harmless folly of the coronation ceremony, and our judges and senators do not sit in solemn conclave to determine who shall carry the king's saltspoon or warming-pan in procession, but we have kept the most dangerous feature of all, the coronation oath &mdash; the oath of office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>I have recently been reading the life of a reformer who was almost a non-resistant &mdash; a man of puritanic habits and simple life, and devoted with his whole soul to the cause of freedom and the people-and yet by yielding to the temptation of using violent means he made his name the object of universal execration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Robespierre was until <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> or so before his death a consistent humanitarian and opponent of bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>It is an historical fact that he resigned a lucrative judgeship because he was unwilling to pronounce a sentence of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>When the <name>Revolution</name> was well under way he proposed a bill for the abolition of capital punishment, and made a good fight for it. He refused to be a member of a court to try royalists, and served on a committee to protect the royal family during the <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> massacres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>Mobs always filled him with abhorrence; he opposed the war with the allies and took every occasion to protest against a standing army on the highest moral grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>He was noted as a friend of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, even when his friendliness compromised his power, and the <name>Girondists</name> attacked him on account of his belief in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>In debate he was particularly fair minded, insisting on obtaining a hearing for his opponents, and never indulging in personalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>It was with reluctance that he became a member of the terror committee, and he invariably avoided signing the guillotine lists when he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>Again and again he denounced the punishment of men for their opinions, no matter what those opinions might be. When the <name>Gironde</name> fell, it was Robespierre who saved the <name>Right</name> from extermination, and, in short, he was, as his last biographer, <persName n="Belloc,,Hilaire,,," id="n0159.0014.00137.00349" reg="default:Belloc,Hilaire,,,"><foreName>Hilaire</foreName> <surname>Belloc</surname></persName>, says, <quote>A man by nature opposed to the <rs>Terror</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Throughout these fearful times he maintained unaltered a dream of a perfect state in which all should be happy and all virtuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>And yet this man gradually gave his consent to the <rs>Terror</rs> in order that he might maintain his power and realize his vision, until, familiar with its frightful mien, he seized upon it as a means to his end, and was finally destroyed by the extremists whom he intended to kill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>It is an <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> undoubted fact that his plan was, after a few more days of slaughter, to abolish the revolutionary court and inaugurate his Rousseauan commonwealth; but it is idle to speculate as to what might have happened if he had not fallen so soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>To the end he remained true to some of his ideals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>He would not consent to an insurrection in his own behalf until it was too late, nor when arrested would he accept release without the order of the <rs>Convention</rs>, for the <rs>Convention</rs> represented his adored People.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>But for this delay his life would have been saved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>How can such a career as Robespierre's be explained?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>With <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0014.00138.00350" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:6"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s faith in the unaided power of the right, he would have had a sure clue to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Without that faith no man is to be trusted in such an environment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>It is difficult for us to imagine the effect of bloodthirsty surroundings; and yet have we not seen in <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">South Africa</placeName> and <placeName reg="Zhonghua" key="tgn,1000111">China</placeName> and the <name>Philippines</name> equally striking examples of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>Robespierre became finally a conspicuous incarnation of all that he most hated, and he reached this point by adopting means which he knew were wrong, to gain an end in which he profoundly believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>He dreaded most of all to be left out of the stream of eventsdropped on <num value="1">one</num> side on account of his scruples, and consequently he plunged in, was sucked into the maelstrom, and died, <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> having justly earned that reputation which of all others he would most have deprecated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>If he had fallen before the trial of the <rs>King</rs>, or if he had remained true to his conscience and returned home when he found that he could no longer guide his country along the paths of peace, his name would have gone down in history with <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0014.00139.00351" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:6"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s as that of a benefactor of mankind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>When the time comes to make another distinct advance in that great movement towards justice of which the <rs>French Revolution</rs> and the anti-slavery agitation were episodes, shall we follow the lead of Robespierre or that of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0014.00139.00352" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:6"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>It is quite possible that a revolution in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> to-day would end as did that of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct> in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>It will not do to pooh-pooh the idea as monstrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>Men who can shoot down prisoners and administer the water torture in the <name>Orient</name> might have no insuperable objection to the guillotine at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>In the case of some great industrial crisis within the next few years, when practically all workmen are idle, let us suppose that they begin to riot in many places at once, and call for the bread which they cannot earn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>The ordinary machinery of commerce and of government has broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>In the midst of the disorder a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">national convention</orgName> is called and delegates flock to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, with the mutterings and threats of <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> discontent and starvation in their ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>They would no longer be the futile politicians of ordinary elections &mdash; the absurd and ridiculous mannikins who now strut through the forms of legislation; but real representatives of the people, newly stirred to a consciousness of their needs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>I fancy I could name a score of the delegates-men and women of the highest ideals and capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>Such a representative body would be certain to compare favorably from the point of view of ability with the <rs>French Assembly</rs>, and it would come together with the same lofty aims and the same devotion to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>Would it end in the same carnival of horror?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>With the example of the peace-loving Robespierre before us it is impossible to scout the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>The only safeguard against such a danger is the utter repudiation of all violent methods of reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Once permit yourself to rely upon rifles and prisons, and the descent is easy to all kinds of cruelty and torture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>The lesson of all history is that men are not to be trusted with the power of life and death over their fellows; and any revolution which claims for itself any such power carries in its bosom the seeds of a counter movement which will bring in again the supremacy of the party of reaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>The best mental exercise for reformers is to accustom themselves to the idea of dispensing with the use of physical <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> force, and of commending their cause to the higher powers of influence, persuasion and truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>And <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0014.00141.00353" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:6"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> was the true prophet of such a peaceful method.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>He had the genuine spirit of reform which we might do well to accept from him as an inheritance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>He was, indeed, to use his friend <placeName reg="Quincy, Adams, Illinois" key="tgn,7014306">Quincy</placeName>'s words, uttered as early as <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, <quote><num value="1">one</num> of those rare spirits which heaven at distant periods sends upon the earth on holiest missions.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>He was, as all such men are, in advance of his time,--<quote>too great . . to be a representative man at present,</quote> as <persName n="Martineau,,Harriet,,," id="n0159.0014.00141.00354" reg="default:Martineau,Harriet,,,"><foreName>Harriet</foreName> <surname>Martineau</surname></persName> declared, but, she added, <quote>his example may raise up a class hereafter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>Such an example is indeed full of inspiration for those who see in the world around them many evils not altogether unrelated to those against which <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0159.0014.00141.00355" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:6"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> struggled so long and so faithfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>But wherever the cause of justice may call us, let us be careful to go in his spirit, for, as <num value="1">one</num> of his fellow-workers truly said, <quote>Non-resistance is the temper of mind in which all enterprises for humanity should be undertaken.</quote>
