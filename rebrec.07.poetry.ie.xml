<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>With a strength I thought impossible in me, I drew him crushed and bleeding from beneath the carcase of our poor old horse, whom we had both so loved and petted, and dipping my handkerchief in a little pool of water amongst the bushes, bathed his face, and pressed some moisture between his parched, swollen lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>He was utterly senseless, and there was a dreadful wound in his head.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The hazardous work of laying the pontoon-bridges was frequently interrupted by the murderous fire of rebel sharp-shooters, concealed in the stores and dwelling-houses on the bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>They marched out of their intrenchments by regiments upon the grassy declivity immediately outside their fort; they stacked their arms, hung their colors upon the centre, laid off their knapsacks, belts, cartridge-boxes and cap-pouches, and thus shorn of the accoutrements of the soldier returned inside their works, and thence down the <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> road into the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>The men went through the ceremony with that downcast look so touching on a soldier's face; not a word was spoken; there was none of that gay badinage we are so much accustomed to hear from the ranks of regiments marching through our streets; the few words of command necessary were given by their own officers in that low tone of voice we hear used at funerals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>Your portals whence the spirits fled are as calm and pale as moonlight upon snow &mdash; as though no sweet love had ever woven for ye myrtle wreaths, nor death draped your hearts in ivy &mdash; as though mirth had never smiled nor sorrow wept where all is now silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>War with its dangers, earth with its perplexities, neglect and poverty with their pangs, slander with its barb, the dear heart-broken ones at home &mdash; all fail to call ye back to strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>A dark and fearful shadow has crept over the land and gathered ye in its gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>O the tears that will be shed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>O the hearths that will be desolated!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>Eyes will look in vain for your return to the hearths that ye once gladdened, while Fame crowns ye with its laurels, and the land of the hereafter welcomes ye as <quote>they who saved the land.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>A remarkably sweet and youthful face was that of a rebel boy. Scarce <num value="18">eighteen</num>, and as fair as a maiden, with quite small hands, long hair of the pale golden hue that auburn changes to when much in the sun, and curling at the ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>He had on a shirt of coarse white cotton, and brown pants, well worn; while upon his feet were a woman's shoes of about the size known as <quote>fours.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>Too delicate was his frame for war; perchance some mother's idol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>His left side was torn by a shell, and his left shoulder shattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>Poor misguided boy!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/><num value="2">Two</num> men who had caught at a fig tree to assist them up a steep embankment lay dead at its feet slain in all probability by an enfilade fire from their right; the branch at which they caught was still in their grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>Some could not be recognized by their nearest friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>Several were headless &mdash; others were armless; but the manner of their death was always plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>The Minie left its large, rather clear hole; the shell its horrid rent; the shrapnel and grape their clear, great gashes, as though <num value="1">one</num> had thrust a giant's spear through the tender, quivering flesh.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>In <num value="1">one</num> trench lay <num value="2">two</num>, grasping the same weapon &mdash; friend and foe. Across their hands fell a vine, the end upon the breast of the rebel, where it had fallen with them from an elevation above; the roots still damp with the fresh earth; upon it was a beautiful passion flower in full bloom and <num value="2">two</num> buds; the buds were stained with blood &mdash; the flower as bright as was the day when the morning stars sang together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>On the faces of both was the calm that follows sleep &mdash; rather pale, perhaps, but seeming like him of old, of whom it was said, <quote>He is not dead, but sleepeth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>But ah, the. crimson!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>All is not well where earth is stained with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>In some places the dead were piled, literally, like sacks of grain upon the shore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>It is remarkable with what patience the fatally wounded, they who already stood upon the shore, bore their sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>Some knew that they could not recover, but bore it manfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>Sometimes a tear, and a low voice would say, <quote>My sweet wife,</quote> or <quote><placeName key="tgn,2295265" n="1.000 14" reg="drewry's bluff, chesterfield, virginia">Darling</placeName>,</quote> <quote>Mother,</quote> <quote><name n="God" type="God">God</name> forgive</quote> --a quiver, then all <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>Death is life's mystery &mdash; that undiscovered country whence none return &mdash; in no place so great and marvellous a study as here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/><num value="1">One</num> would think that war would develop ferocity in hard natures; perhaps it does; but it is not shown in the faces of the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>They enter the silent land with eyes open; a stare of surprise is in them; the lines of care are softened upon the brow, and the cheek, when untorn, shows determination, as though they slept where doubt is unknown, where all mystery is revealed; where the reason of our creation, to bear the myrtle leaf of joy or the habiliments of mourning, to reap the golden sheaves of content or gather the mildew of misery, is known.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>They have been sent, rather than gone, to the garner where all shall be gathered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>This is the work of treason!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>This it is to unroof the temple of law and order, and let loose the demon of discord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>A people more than prosperous have fallen upon evil times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>Murder, arson, theft, all kinds of injustice, follow in the footsteps of war. Nor is the end yet. When shall spears and swords be beaten into ploughshares and pruning-hooks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>Large bodies of the enemy were seen moving to our right, but feeling fully prepared for them at all points, no diversion was made from our lines to counteract the rebel movements.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>On the right some picket-firing occurred with the enemy's skirmishers, but no further aggressive movements were indulged in. During the day considerable enthusiasm was manifested along the rebel lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Great cheering at the remarks of orators was indulged in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>The enemy seemed quite desirous of advancing their lines under cover of darkness, but they found the <name>Unionists</name> in sufficient force and strength to successfully dispute any encroachments upon their established lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>From some hostile demonstration on our centre, a battery was opened upon the enemy, which soon made all quiet again in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>Rockets were to be seen in the air during the night, with which the <rs>Federal</rs> pickets had been furnished for the conveyance of information, should the enemy make any demonstrations of advance or other movements.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Toward morning a heavy fog hung over the ground in our front, completely screening the position of the enemy from view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>In anticipation of the rebels taking advantage of this circumstance to advance and post their batteries, a fire was opened upon their lines, and continued until all was known to be safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>The enemy have not replied to our batteries for the last <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>. What may be their present or future intentions cannot be well conjectured.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>But it is to be presumed that our military authorities here are fully aware of all the demonstrative movements of the foe, and will make all the necessary changes consequent to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>The rebels will, no doubt, make great efforts to interrupt our line of communication with the <rs>North</rs>, and thus cut off our army supplies; but in this they will be mistaken, as there is now a large supply of provisions here for future consumption, sufficient to prevent any inconvenience that might occur from the designs of the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2001"/>Dear brother: . . . If I am not mistaken, some of the blockade-runners will lose a pile of money, as confederate money is becoming at such a discount they cannot get price enough on the goods to pay the difference of exchange, as all goods have to be paid in gold or sterling exchange, and all freights prepaid, and then take all chances of getting them through, besides paying duties on them at <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2002"/>Some of the blockade men think the next steamer from <placeName reg="Fort Dixie">Dixie</placeName> will bring bad news, and there will be a much greater discount on confederate money &mdash; say <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">seven hundred dollars</measure> or <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> for <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> in gold, and my opinion is it will soon be worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2003"/>Yesterday I bought here (<placeName key="tgn,7006630;tgn,2535807" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America" reg="nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>) <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> in confederate money at <measure n="4cents" type="currency">four cents</measure> on the dollar, and some was sold here for even a greater discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2004"/>So you can see what the people here think of Dixie money, and in fact no <num value="1">one</num> here will take it at any price for goods or for freight money; and if I had a <num value="1000000">million</num> of gold dollars I would not invest <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> here and take the chances of getting through and take confederate money.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2005"/>If you have any confederate money on hand when you receive this, get clear of it on the best terms you possibly can, and in future do not take any more confederate money, only at what you can sell it for gold, and turn it into gold as soon as you receive it.

<p>conduct Op the negro troops.--While an occasional shot was being fired, before the battle commenced in its more deadly fury, speculations were rife as to the manner in which the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA2">Second Louisiana</orgName> black troops would act during the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>They had been placed in the rear, with white troops leading them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>The negroes at once rushed to the assigned point, and in the midst of the battle they proceeded to storm the rebel position opposite to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>They rushed in a body over the parapets and siege-guns, and reached the interior of the fort, in despite of the opposition of a large number of rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>The presence of the black soldiers inside, not less than the probability that the pass they had made into the stronghold, seemed to create a spirit of fury in the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>They left their guns at all points, and rushed to the quarter where the negroes had prepared to make a vigorous struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>The whites and blacks in a moment had a hand-to-hand conflict unprecedented for its ferocity.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>The negroes in the conflict were soon disarmed, and in defending themselves they rapidly used the weapons of savage humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>In every position in which the struggle placed them, they fought with their teeth, biting their assailants in every available part or the body, kicking and scratching them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>Soon, however, they had to succumb; the bayonet, the trigger, the revolver, and merciless hands on their throats, doing the work for them with fearful fatality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>It may be here noted, as a key perhaps to other battles, that the presence of the black troops made the rebels in the fort almost as ferocious as the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>In the attack, the enemy did not content himself in wounding the <name>Africans</name>; <hi rend="italics">of <num value="800">eight hundred</num>, <num value="600">six hundred</num> were at once killed;</hi> when <num value="1">one</num> was wounded, the assault was repeated till he died.
