<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName> has been from the beginning in a perpetual change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The physical and mental restlessness of the <rs>American</rs> and the temporary nature of many of his arrangements are largely due to the experimental character of the exploration and development of this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>The new energies released by the settlement of the colonies were indeed guided by stern determination, wise forethought, and inventive skill; but no <num value="1">one</num> has ever really known the outcome of the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>It is a story of faith, of <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/></p><l>Effort, and expectation, and desire,</l> <l>And something evermore about to be.</l></quote> <pb id="p.2" n="2"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>An <persName n="Hamilton,,Alexander,,," id="n0200.0001.00002.00001" reg="default:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> may urge with passionate force the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, without any firm conviction as to its permanence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The most clear-sighted American of the <rs>Civil War</rs> period recognized this element of uncertainty in our American adventure when he declared: <quote>We are now testing whether this nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>More than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> have passed since that war reaffirmed the binding force of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and apparently sealed the perpetuity of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Yet the gigantic economic and social changes now in progress are serving to show that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has its full share of the anxieties which beset all human institutions in this daily altering world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><quote>We are but strangers in an inn, but passengers in a ship,</quote> said <persName n="Williams,,Roger,,," id="n0200.0001.00002.00002" reg="default:Williams,Roger,,,"><foreName>Roger</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This sense of the transiency of human effort, the perishable nature of human institutions, was quick in the consciousness of the gentleman adventurers and sober <placeName reg="Puritan, Vinton, Ohio" key="tgn,2601475">Puritan</placeName> citizens who emigrated from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It had been a familiar note in the poetry of that Elizabethan period which had followed with such breathless interest the exploration of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was a conception which could be shared alike by a saint like John Cotton or a <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> soldier of fortune like <persName n="Smith,,John,,," id="n0200.0001.00003.00003" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Men are tentdwellers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Today they settle here, and tomorrow they have struck camp and are gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We are strangers and sojourners, as all our fathers were.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This instinct of the camper has stamped itself upon American life and thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Venturesomeness, physical and moral daring, resourcefulness in emergencies, indifference to negligible details, wastefulness of materials, boundless hope and confidence in the morrow, are characteristics of the <rs>American</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is scarcely an exaggeration to say that the <quote>good American</quote> has been he who has most resembled a good camper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He has had robust health &mdash; unless or until he has abused it,--a tolerant disposition, and an ability to apply his fingers or his brain to many unrelated and unexpected tasks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He is disposed to blaze his own trail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He has a touch of prodigality, and, withal, a knack of keeping his tent or his affairs in better order than they seem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Above all, he has been ever ready to break camp when he feels the impulse to wander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He likes to be <quote>foot-loose.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>If he does not build his roads as solidly as the <rs>Roman</rs> roads were built, nor his houses like the <rs>English</rs> houses, it is because he feels that he is here today and gone tomorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>If he has squandered the physical <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> resources of his neighborhood, cutting the forests recklessly, exhausting the soil, surrendering water power and minerals into a few far-clutching fingers, he has done it because he expects, like <persName n="Voltaire,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00004.00004" reg="mostcommon:Voltaire,nomatch:0"><surname>Voltaire</surname></persName>'s <persName n="Pococurante,,Signor,,," id="n0200.0001.00004.00005" reg="default:Pococurante,Signor,,,"><foreName>Signor</foreName> <surname>Pococurante</surname></persName>, <quote>to have a new garden tomorrow, built on a nobler plan.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>When <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">New York State</placeName> grew too crowded for <persName n="Cooper,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00004.00006" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,Fenimore,,,:3"><surname>Cooper</surname></persName>'s Leather-Stocking, he shouldered his pack, whistled to his dog, glanced at the sun, and struck a bee-line for the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Nothing could be more typical of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="300years" type="date">three hundred years</measure> of American history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The traits of the pioneer have thus been the characteristic traits of the <rs>American</rs> in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The memories of successive generations have tended to stress these qualities to the neglect of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Everyone who has enjoyed the free life of the woods will confess' that his own judgment upon his casual summer associates turns, quite naturally and almost exclusively, upon their characteristics as woodsmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Out of the woods, these gentlemen may be more or less admirable divines, pedants, men of affairs; but the verdict of their companions in the forest is based chiefly upon the single question of their adaptability to the environment of the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Are they quick of eye and foot, skillful with rod and gun, cheerful on <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> rainy days, ready to do a little more than their share of drudgery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If so, memory holds them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Some such unconscious selection as this has been at work in the classification of our representative men. The building of the nation and the literary expression of its purpose and ideals are tasks which have called forth the strength of a great variety of individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Some of these men have proved to be peculiarly fitted for a specific service, irrespective of the question of their general intellectual powers, or their rank as judged by the standard of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> performance in the same field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Thus the <rs n="Battle of New Orleans" type="battle">battle of New Orleans</rs>, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> eyes a mere bit of frontier fighting, made <persName n="Jackson,,Andrew,,," id="n0200.0001.00005.00007" reg="default:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> a <quote>hero</quote> as indubitably as if he had defeated <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00005.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It gave him the <name>Presidency</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The analogy holds in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Certain expressions of American sentiment or conviction have served to summarize or to clarify the spirit of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The authors of these productions have frequently won the recognition and affection of their contemporaries by means of prose and verse quite unsuited to sustain the test of severe critical standards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Neither <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00005.00009" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,Henry,Wadsworth,,:2"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>'s <title>Excelsior</title> nor <persName n="Poe,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00005.00010" reg="nearbymention:Poe,Edgar,Allan,,"><surname>Poe</surname></persName>'s <title>Bells</title> nor <persName n="Whittier,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00005.00011" reg="mostcommon:Whittier,John,Greenleaf,,:2"><surname>Whittier</surname></persName>'s <title><persName n="Muller,,Maud,,," id="n0200.0001.00005.00012" reg="default:Muller,Maud,,,"><foreName>Maud</foreName> <surname>Muller</surname></persName></title> <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> is among the best poems of the <num value="3">three</num> writers in question, yet there was something in each of these productions which caught the fancy of a whole American generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It expressed <num value="1">one</num> phase of the national mind in a given historical period.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The historian of literature is bound to take account of this question of literary vogue, as it is highly significant of the temper of successive generations in any country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But it is of peculiar interest to the student of the literature produced in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Is this literature <quote>American,</quote> or is it <quote><name>English</name> literature in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>,</quote> as <persName n="Wendell,Professor,,,," id="n0200.0001.00006.00013" reg="mostcommon:Wendell,Barrett,,,:4"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Wendell</surname></persName> and other scholars have preferred to call it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I should be <num value="1">one</num> of the last to minimize the enormous influence of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> upon the mind and the writing of all the <name>Englishspeaking</name> countries of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Yet it will be <num value="1">one</num> of the purposes of the present book to indicate the existence here, even in colonial times, of a point of view differing from that of the mother country, and destined to differ increasingly with the lapse of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Since the formation of our <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, in particular, the books produced in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have tended to exhibit certain characteristics which differentiate them from the books produced in other English-speaking countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> must beware, of course, of what the late <rs>Charles Francis Adams</rs> once called the <quote>filiopietistic</quote> fallacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The <quote>American</quote> qualities of our literature must be judged in connection with its conformity to universal standards of excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Tested by any universal standard, <title>The Scarlet letter</title> is a notable romance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It has won a secure place among the literature written by men of <name>English</name> blood and speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Yet to overlook the peculiarly local or provincial characteristics of this remarkable story is to miss the secret of its inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It could have been written only by a <orgName n="New Englander" type="newspaper">New Englander</orgName>, in the atmosphere of a certain epoch.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Our task, then, in this rapid review of the chief interpreters of the <rs>American</rs> spirit in literature, is a twofold <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We are primarily concerned with a procession of men, each of whom is interesting as an individual and as a writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But we cannot watch the individuals long without perceiving the general direction of their march, the ideas that animate them, the common hopes and loyalties that make up the life of their spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>To become aware of these general tendencies is to understand the <quote>American</quote> note in our national writing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Our historians have taught us that the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is an evolution towards political <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> unity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The separatist, particularist movements are gradually thrust to <num value="1">one</num> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>In literary history, likewise, we best remember those authors who fall into line with what we now perceive to have been the course of our literary development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The erratic men and women, the <quote>sports</quote> of the great experiment, are ultimately neglected by the critics, unless, like the leaders of political insurrections, those writing men and women have raised a notable standard of revolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>No doubt the apparently unique literary specimens, if clearly understood in their origins and surroundings, would be found rooted in the general laws of literary evolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But these laws are not easy to codify and we must avoid the temptation to discover, in any particular period, more of unity than there actually was. And we must always remember that there will be beautiful prose and verse unrelated to the main national tendencies save as <quote>the literature of escape.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We owe this lesson to the genius of <persName n="Poe,,Edgar,Allan,," id="n0200.0001.00008.00014" reg="default:Poe,Edgar,Allan,,"><foreName>Edgar</foreName> <foreName>Allan</foreName> <surname>Poe</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Let us test these principles by applying them to the earliest colonists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book written on the soil of what is now the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was <persName n="Smith,Captain,John,,," id="n0200.0001.00008.00015" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s <title><persName n="Relation,,True,,," id="n0200.0001.00008.00016" reg="default:Relation,True,,,"><foreName>True</foreName> <surname>Relation</surname></persName></title> of the planting of the <rs>Virginia</rs> colony in <dateStruct value="1607--"><year reg="1607">1607</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It was published in <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1608--"><year reg="1608">1608</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> was a typical Elizabethan adventurer, with a gift, like so many of his class, for picturesque narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>In what sense, if at all, may his writings on American topics be classified as <quote>American</quote> literary productions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is clear that his experiences in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> were only <num value="1">one</num> phase of the variegated life of this <name>English</name> soldier of fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But the <rs>American</rs> imagination has persistently claimed him as representing something peculiarly ours, namely, a kind of pioneer hardihood, resourcefulness, leadership, which was essential to the exploration and conquest of the wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Most of <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00009.00017" reg="nearbymention:Smith,John,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s companions were unfitted for the ordeal which he survived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>They perished miserably in the <quote>starving time.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>But he was of the stuff from which triumphant immigrants have ever been made, and it is our recognition of the presence of these qualities in the <rs>Captain</rs> which makes us think of his books dealing with <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> as if they were <quote>American books.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>There are other narratives by colonists temporarily residing in the <rs type="place">Virginia plantations</rs> which gratify our historical curiosity, but which we no more consider a part of American literature than the books written by <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00009.00018" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,Burton,E.,,:1"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Kipling,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00009.00019" reg="mostcommon:Kipling,nomatch:0"><surname>Kipling</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Wells,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00009.00020" reg="mostcommon:Wells,nomatch:0"><surname>Wells</surname></persName> during their casual visits to this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/><pb id="p.10" n="10"/> But <persName n="Smith,Captain,,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00021" reg="nearbymention:Smith,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s <title><persName n="Relation,,True,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00022" reg="default:Relation,True,,,"><foreName>True</foreName> <surname>Relation</surname></persName></title> impresses us, like <persName n="Mark Twain,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00023" reg="mostcommon:Mark Twain,nomatch:0"><surname>Mark Twain</surname></persName>'s <title>Roughing it</title>, with being somehow true to type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In each of these books the possible unveracities in detail are a confirmation of their representative American character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>In other words, we have unconsciously formulated, in the course of centuries, a general concept of <quote>the pioneer.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Novelists, poets, and historians have elaborated this conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Nothing is more inevitable than our reaching back to the beginning of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century and endeavoring to select, among the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of Englishmen who emigrated or even thought of emigrating to this country, those who possessed the genuine heart and sinew of the permanent settler.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><persName n="Cromwell,,Oliver,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00024" reg="default:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, for instance, is said to have thought of emigrating hither in <dateStruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>If he had joined his friends John Cotton and <persName n="Williams,,Roger,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00025" reg="default:Williams,Roger,,,"><foreName>Roger</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, who can doubt that the personal characteristics of <quote>my brave <persName n="Oliver,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00026" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,nomatch:0"><surname>Oliver</surname></persName></quote> would today be identified with the <quote>American</quote> qualities which we discover in <dateStruct value="1637--"><year reg="1637">1637</year></dateStruct> on the shores of <placeName reg="Massachusetts Bay, Massachusetts, United States" key="tgn,7007518">Massachusetts Bay</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>And what an American settler <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0200.0001.00010.00027" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> would have made!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>If we turn from physical and moral daring to the <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> field of theological and political speculation, it is easy today to select, among the writings of the earliest colonists, certain radical utterances which seem to presage the very temper of the late <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Pastor <persName n="Robinson,,John,,," id="n0200.0001.00011.00028" reg="default:Robinson,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>'s farewell address to the <name>Pilgrims</name> at <placeName key="tgn,2446784;tgn,7006809" n="0.097 000000.6820	placename;tgn,2446784;leyden, franklin county, massachusetts,Franklin,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.039 000000.2728	placename;tgn,7006809;leiden,zuid-holland,nederland,europe,Zuid-Holland,Nederland,Europe" reg="leyden, franklin county, massachusetts,Franklin,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;leiden,zuid-holland,nederland,europe,Zuid-Holland,Nederland,Europe">Leyden</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1620--"><year reg="1620">1620</year></dateStruct> contained the famous words: <quote>The <rs>Lord</rs> has more truth yet to break forth out of His holy Word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I cannot sufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion. . . . <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Calvin</foreName></persName> were great and shining lights in their times, yet they penetrated not into the whole counsel of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>In political discussion, the early emergence of that type of independence familiar to the decade <dateStruct value="1765--"><year reg="1765">1765</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">75</year></dateStruct> is equally striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>In a letter written in <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Adams,,John,,," id="n0200.0001.00011.00031" reg="default:Adams,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> insisted that <quote>the principles and feelings which produced the <name>Revolution</name> ought to be traced back for <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>, and sought in the history of the country from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> plantations in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><quote>I have always laughed,</quote> he declared in an earlier letter, <quote>at the affectation of representing American independence <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> as a novel idea, as a modern discovery, as a late invention.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>The mental and moral traits of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> colonists, already glanced at in an earlier chapter, had suffered little essential modification in <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>. The original racial stock was still dominant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>As compared with the middle and southern colonies, there was relatively little immigration, and this was easily assimilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>The physical remoteness of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> from other sections of the country, and the stubborn loyalty with which its inhabitants maintained their own standards of life, alike contributed to their sense of separateness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>It is true, of course, that their mode of thinking and feeling had undergone certain changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>They were among the <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> earliest theorists of political independence from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and had done their share, and more, in the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>The rigors of their early creed had somewhat relaxed, as we have seen, by the end of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> century, and throughout the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> there was a gradual progress toward religious liberalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The population steadily increased, and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>'s unremitting struggle with a not too friendly soil, her hardihood upon the seas, and her keenness in trade, became proverbial throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Her seaport towns were wealthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The general standards of living remained frugal, but extreme poverty was rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Her people still made, as in the earliest days of the colonies, silent and unquestioned sacrifices for education, and her chief seats of learning, <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> and <persName n="Yale,,,,," id="n0200.0006.00110.00607" reg="mostcommon:Yale,nomatch:0"><surname>Yale</surname></persName>, remained the foremost educational centers of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>But there was still scant leisure for the quest of beauty, and slender material reward for any practitioner of the fine arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Perhaps they were superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Appreciation <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> of the spoken word was natural to men trained by generations of thoughtful listening to <quote>painful</quote> preaching and by participation in the discussions of town-meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Yet appreciation of secular literature was rare, and interest in the other arts was almost non-existent.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>But in that stern section of the country where its influence had been most marked there was now an increasingly sharp reaction against its determinism and its pessimism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>Early in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century the most ancient and influential churches in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and the leading professors at <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> had accepted the new form <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> of religious liberalism known as Unitarianism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The movement spread throughout <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Massachusetts</placeName> and made its way to other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>It is only with its literary influence that we are here concerned, yet that literary influence became so potent that there is scarcely a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> writer of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rank, from <persName n="Bryant,,,,," id="n0200.0006.00113.00617" reg="nearbymention:Bryant,Peter,,,"><surname>Bryant</surname></persName> onward, who remained untouched by it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>The most interesting and peculiar phase of the new liberalism has little directly to do with the specific tenets of theological Unitarianism, and in fact marked a revolt against the more prosaic and conventional pattern of English and American Unitarian thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>But this movement, known as Transcendentalism, would have been impossible without a preliminary and liberalizing stirring of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>It was a fascinating moment of release for some of the most brilliant and radical minds of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Its foremost representative in our literature was <persName n="Emerson,,Ralph,Waldo,," id="n0200.0006.00113.00618" reg="default:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><foreName>Ralph</foreName> <foreName>Waldo</foreName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, as its chief <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> exponents in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0200.0006.00114.00619" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName> and <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0200.0006.00114.00620" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>What then is the significance of the word Transcendental?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Disregarding for the moment the technical development of this term as used by <name>German</name> and <name>English</name> philosophers, it meant for <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0200.0006.00114.00621" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName> and his friends simply this: whatever transcends or goes beyond the experience of the senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>It had only to be trusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Stated in this form, it is evident that we have here a very ancient doctrine, well known in the literature of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> and of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>They must be swiftly summarized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> obstacle to the popular acceptance of <persName n="Whitman,,Walt,,," id="n0200.0008.00202.01111" reg="default:Whitman,Walt,,,"><foreName>Walt</foreName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> is the formlessness or alleged formlessness of <title>Leaves of Grass</title>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>This is a highly technical question, involving a more accurate notation than has thus far been made of the patterns and tunes of free verse and of emotional prose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>As regards the contents of his verse, it is plain that he included much material unfused and untransformed by emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>These elements foreign to the nature of poetry clog many of his lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/>The enumerated objects in his catalogue or inventory <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> poems often remain inert objects only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>Like many mystics, he was hypnotized by external phenomena, and he often fails to communicate to his reader the trance-like emotion which he himself experienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>This imperfect transfusion of his material is a far more significant defect in <persName n="Whitman,,,,," id="n0200.0008.00203.01113" reg="nearbymention:Whitman,Walt,,,"><surname>Whitman</surname></persName>'s poetry than the relatively few passages of unashamed sexuality which shocked the <rs>American</rs> public in <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>The gospel or burden of <title>Leaves of Grass</title> is no more difficult of comprehension than the general drift of <persName n="Emerson,,,,," id="n0200.0008.00203.01114" reg="nearbymention:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><surname>Emerson</surname></persName>'s essays, which helped to inspire it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>In the light of this experience, all created things are recognized as divine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>The starting-point and center of the <rs>Whitman</rs> world is the individual man, the <quote>strong person,</quote> imperturbable in mind, athletic in body, unconquerable, and immortal.
