<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>the period of the <rs>American Revolution</rs> of which a portion is here treated, divides itself into <num value="2">two</num> epochs; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> extending to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to the acknowledgment of that Independence by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, In preparing the volume, there has been no parsimony of labor; but marginal references to the documents out of which it has mainly been constructed are omitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>This is done not from an unwillingness to subject every statement of fact, even in its minutest details, to the severest scrutiny; but from the variety and multitude of the papers which have been used, and which could not be intelligibly cited, without burdening the pages with a disproportionate commentary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>From the very voluminous manuscripts which I have brought together, I hope at some not very distant day to cull out for publication such letters as may at once confirm my narrative and possess an intrinsic and general <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> interest by illustrating the character and sentiments of the people during the <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> preceding the <dateStruct value="1776-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>At the close of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> volume of this work, some imperfect acknowledgment was made to those from whom I have received most essential service while making my collection of materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>I shall hereafter have occasion to recur to that subject; at this time I desire to express my sense of the friendly regard of many persons in various parts of our country, who have sent me unpublished documents, or historical pamphlets and monographs, such as the liberal and inquisitive are constantly producing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Whatever can be obtained in the ordinary way through the booksellers, I have no need to solicit; but I am and shall ever be grateful to any person who will forward to me at New York any materials which cannot be obtained except through private courtesy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The movement was quickened, even when it was most resisted; and its fiercest adversaries worked together effectually for its fulfilment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The indestructible elements of freedom in the colonies asked room for expansion and growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The resources of the vast country in agriculture and commerce, forests and fisheries, mines and materials for manufactures, were so diversified and complete, that their development could neither be guided nor circumscribed by a government beyond the ocean; the numbers, purity, culture, industry, and daring of its inhabitants proclaimed the existence of a people, rich in creative energy, and ripe for institutions of their own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They were rushing towards revolution, and they knew it not. They refused to acknowledge even to themselves the hope that was swelling within them; and yet they were possessed by the truth, that man holds inherent and indefeasible rights; and as their religion had its witness coeval and coextensive with intelligence, so in their political aspirations they deduced from universal principles a <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">bill of rights</rs>, as old as creation and as wide as humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The idea of freedom had never been wholly unknown; it had always revealed itself at least to a few of the wise, whose prophetic instincts were quickened by love of their kind; its rising light flashed joy across the darkest centuries; and its growing energy can be traced in the tendency of the ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A revolution, unexpected in the moment of its coming, but prepared by glorious forerunners, grew naturally and necessarily out of the series of past events by the formative principle of a living belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Why should not the consent of the ancestral land and the gratulations of every other call the young nation to its place among the powers of the earth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Britain was the mighty mother who bred and formed men capable of laying the foundation of so noble an empire; and she alone could have formed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>She had excelled all nations of the world as the planter of colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The condition which entitled her colonies to independence was now more than fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Their vigorous vitality refused conformity to foreign laws and external rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They could take no other way to perfection than by the unconstrained development of that which was within them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They were not only able to govern themselves, they alone were able to do so; subordination visibly repressed their energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It was only by self-direction that they could at all times and in entireness freely employ in action their collective and individual powers to the fullest extent of their ever increasing intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Could not the illustrious nation which had gained no distinction in war, in literature, or in science, comparable to that of having wisely founded distant settlements on a system of liberty, willingly perfect its beneficent work, now when no more was required than the acknowledgment that its offspring was come <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> of age, and its own duty accomplished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Why is their unwavering attachment to the essential principle of their existence to be persecuted as treason, rather than viewed with delight as the crowning glory of the country from which they sprung?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If the institutions of Britain were so deeply fixed in the usages and opinions of its people, that their deviations from justice could not as yet be rectified; if the old continent was pining under systems of authority which were not fit to be borne, and which as yet no way opened to amend, why should not a people be heartened to build a commonwealth in the wilderness, which alone offered it a home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>So reasoned a few in Britain who were jeered <q direct="unspecified">as visionary enthusiasts;</q> deserving no weight in public affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Parliament had asserted an absolute lordship over the colonies in all cases whatsoever; and fretting itself into a frenzy at the denial of its unlimited dominion, was blindly destroying all its recognised authority in the madness of its zeal for more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>By lineage, language, universality of personal freedom, and diffusion of landed property, the common people of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> formed <num value="1">one</num> compact and indivisible nation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The feudal aristocracy had been called into being for the protection of the kingdom; but in the progress of ages, they had escaped from the obligation to military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They abdicated their dignity as the peers of their sovereign; and though they still scorned every profession but that of arms, they received their commissions from the king's favor, and drew from his exchequer their pay as hirelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Thus the organization of the army ceased to circumscribe royal power, which now raised soldiers directly from the humbler classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The defence of the country had passed from the king and his peers with their vassals to the king in direct connection with those vassals who were thus become a people.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Proving false to their trust as the privileged guardians of liberty, and renouncing the military service that had formed the motive to their creation, they made themselves an insulated and worthless caste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>All that was beneficent in feudalism had died out. Soulless relics of the past, the nobles threw up their hereditary rustic independence to fasten themselves as courtiers upon the treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They hung like a burden on the state, which they no longer guided, nor sustained, nor defended, nor consoled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Some few among them, rising superior to their rank, helped to bear society onwards to its regeneration; but as a class their life was morally at an end. <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> could throw them off as readily as a stag sheds its antlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>They had abdicated their political importance, which passed to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The imposts which they refused to share, and which in <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> had increased tenfold, fell almost exclusively on the lowly, who toiled and suffered, having no redress against those employed by the government; regarding the monarch with touching reverence and love, though they knew him mostly as the power that harried them; ruled as though joy were no fit companion for labor; as though want were the necessary goad to industry, and sorrow the only guarantee of quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They were the strength of the kingdom, the ceaseless producers of its wealth; the repairer of its armies; the sole and exhaustless source of its revenue; and yet, in their forlornness, they cherished scarcely a dim vision of a happier futurity below.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The clergy were tainted with the general scepticism; they stooped before the temporal power to win its protection, and did not scruple to enforce by persecution a semblance of homage to the symbols of religion, of which the life was put to sleep.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>For the benefit of the king's treasury, free charters, granted or confirmed in the middle ages to towns and cities, had over and over again been confiscated, to be ransomed by the citizens, or sold to an oligarchy; so that municipal liberties were no longer independent of the royal caprice.</p>
