<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In that year <measure n="4000dollars" type="currency">four thousand dollars</measure> were voted for the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Tall and slim, his movements were dignified and easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>His features were strong and his expression grave, but a gentle blue eye and a bright smile prevented any shade of sternness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>High principles carried into every movement of his life, thorough cultivation within moderate limits, strong practical sense, with energy to apply it for the benefit of others,&mdash;these admirable qualities were brightened and enriched by warm affections which never failed those who had the claims of kindred or had earned his regard by worth.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>His frequent fatiguing journeys to <placeName reg="Hanover, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013690">Hanover</placeName> were chiefly for this business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>He is a bachelor, and lives in a style of great splendor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Everything at his table is of silver; and this not for a single course, or for a few persons, but through at least <num value="3">three</num> courses for <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The meat and wines corresponded; the servants were in full livery with epaulets, and the dining-room was sumptuously furnished and hung with pictures of merit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>But what was more to me than his table or his fortune, <persName n="Randolph,,John,,," id="n0230.0002.00027.00267" reg="default:Randolph,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Randolph</surname></persName> is his guest for some weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The instant I entered the room my eyes rested on his lean and sallow physiognomy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>He was sitting, and seemed hardly larger or taller than a boy of <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>He rose to receive me as I was presented, and towered half a foot above my own height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>This disproportion arises from the singular deformity of his person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>His head is small, and, until you approach him near enough to observe the premature and unhealthy wrinkles that have furrowed his face, you would say that it was boyish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>But as your eye turns towards his extremities, everything seems to be unnaturally stretched out and protracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>To his short and meagre body are attached long legs which, instead of diminishing, grow larger as they approach the floor, until they end in a pair of feet, broad and large, giving his whole person the appearance of a sort of pyramid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>His arms are the counterparts of his legs; they rise from small shoulders, which seem hardly equal to the burden, are drawn out to a disproportionate <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> length above the elbow, and to a still greater length below, and at last are terminated by a hand heavy enough to have given the supernatural blow to <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> of Deloraine, and by fingers which might have served as models for those of the goblin page.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>In his physiognomy there is little to please or satisfy, except an eye which glances on all and rests on none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>You observe, however, a mixture of the white man and the <rs>Indian</rs>, marks of both being apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>His long straight hair is parted on the top, and a portion hangs down on each side, while the rest is carelessly tied up behind and flows down his back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>His voice is shrill and effeminate, and occasionally broken by those tones which you sometimes hear from dwarfs and deformed people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>He spoke to me of the hospitality he had found in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and of the prospect of returning to a comfortless home, with a feeling that brought me nearer to him for the moment; and of the illness of his nephew <persName n="Tudor,,,,," id="n0230.0002.00028.00268" reg="mostcommon:Tudor,William,,,:3"><surname>Tudor</surname></persName>, and the hopes that it had blasted, with a tenderness and melancholy which made me think better of his heart than I had before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>It took an hour to cross the river through the ice, and then our way led through open fields, where only <num value="1">one</num> wagon had preceded us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>You are to imagine, then, before you, a short, stout, little gentleman, about <measure n="5.5feet" type="distance">five and a half feet</measure> high, with a very red face, black hair, and black eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>These you are to interpret as the natural indications of the impetuous and impatient character which a further acquaintance develops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>He enters a room with a countenance so satisfied, and a step so light and almost fantastic, that all your previous impressions of the dignity and severity of the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Review,,Edinburgh,,," id="n0230.0002.00044.00423" reg="default:Review,Edinburgh,,,"><foreName>Edinburgh</foreName> <surname>Review</surname></persName></q> are immediately put to flight, and, passing at once to the opposite extreme, you might, perhaps, imagine him to be frivolous, vain, and supercilious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>He accosts you, too, with a freedom and familiarity which may, perhaps, put you at your ease and render conversation unceremonious; but which, as I observed in several instances, were not very tolerable to those who had always been accustomed to the delicacy and decorum of refined society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>It is not possible, however, to be long in his presence without understanding something of his real character,&mdash;for the same promptness and assurance which mark his entrance into a room carry him at once into conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The moment a topic is suggested&mdash;no matter what or by whom&mdash;he comes forth, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing you observe is his singular fluency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>He bursts upon you with a torrent of remarks, and you are for some time so much amused with his earnestness and volubility, that you forget to ask yourself whether they have either appropriateness or meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>When, however, you come to consider his remarks closely, you are surprised to find that, notwithstanding his prodigious rapidity, the current of his language never flows faster than the current of his thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>You are surprised to discover that he is never, like other impetuous speakers, driven to amplification and repetition in order to gain time to collect and arrange his ideas; you are surprised to find that, while his conversation is poured forth in such a fervor and tumult of eloquence that you can scarcely follow or comprehend it, it is still as compact and logical as if he were contending for a victory in the schools or for a decision from the bench.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>After all this, however, you do not begin to understand <persName n="Jeffreys,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0002.00044.00425" reg="mostcommon:Jeffreys,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jeffreys</surname></persName> character; for it is not until you become interested in the mere discussion, until you forget his earnestness, his volubility, and his skill, that you begin to feel something of the full extent of his powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/><pb id="p.45" n="45"/> You do not, till then, see with how strong and steady a hand he seizes the subject, and with what ease, as well as dexterity, he turns and examines it on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>You are not, until then, convinced that he but plays with what is the labor of ordinary minds, and that half his faculties are not called into exercise by what you at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed would tax his whole strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>And, after all, you are able to estimate him, not by what you witness,&mdash;for he is always above a topic which can be made the subject of conversation,&mdash;but by what you imagine he would be able to do if he were excited by a great and difficult subject and a powerful adversary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>With all this, he preserves in your estimation a transparent simplicity of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>You are satisfied that he does nothing for effect and show; you see that he never chooses the subject, and never <hi rend="italics">leads</hi> the conversation in such a way as best to display his own powers and acquirements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>You see that he is not ambitious of being thought a wit; and that, when he has been most fortunate in his argument or illustration, he never looks round, as some great men do, to observe what impression he has produced upon his hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>In short, you could not be in his presence an hour without being convinced that he has neither artifice nor affectation; that he does not talk from the pride of skill or of victory, but because his mind is full to overflowing, and conversation is his relief and pleasure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>But, notwithstanding everybody saw and acknowledged these traits in <persName n="Jeffrey,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0002.00045.00426" reg="mostcommon:Jeffrey,Francis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jeffrey</surname></persName>'s character, he was very far from winning the good opinion of all. There were still not a few who complained that he was supercilious, and that he thought himself of a different and higher order from those he met; that he had been used to dictate until he was unwilling to listen, and that he had been fed upon admiration until it had become common food, and he received it as a matter of course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>There is some ground for this complaint; but I think the circumstances of the case should take its edge from censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>It seems to me that <persName n="Jeffrey,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0002.00045.00427" reg="mostcommon:Jeffrey,Francis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jeffrey</surname></persName> has enough of that amiable feeling from which politeness and the whole system of the <hi rend="italics">petite morale</hi> springs, but that he has not learned the necessary art of distributing it in judicious proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>He shows the same degree of deference to every <num value="1">one</num> he meets; and, therefore, while he flatters by his civility those who are little accustomed to attention from their superiors, he disappoints the reasonable expectations of those who have received the homage of all around them until it has become a part of their just expectations and claims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/><pb id="p.46" n="46"/></p> 
<p>This, at least, was the distinction here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The young men and the literary men all admired him; the old men and the politicians found their opinions and dignity too little regarded by the impetuous stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>The reasons of this are to be sought, I should think, in his education and constitution; and I was, therefore, not disposed to like him the less for his defect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>I was not disposed to claim from a man who must have passed his youth in severe and solitary study, and who was not brought into that class of society which refines and fashions all the external expressions of character, until his mind and habits were matured, and he was brought there to be admired and to dictate,&mdash;I was not disposed to claim from <hi rend="italics">him</hi> that gentleness and delicacy of manners which are acquired only by early discipline, and which are most obvious in those who have received, perhaps, their very character and direction from early collision with their superiors in station or talents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Besides, even admitting that <persName n="Jeffrey,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0002.00046.00428" reg="mostcommon:Jeffrey,Francis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jeffrey</surname></persName> could have been early introduced to refined society, still I do not think his character would have been much changed; or, if it had been, that it would have been changed for the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>I do not think it would have been possible to have drilled him into the strict forms of society and <hi rend="italics">bienseance</hi> without taking from him something we should be very sorry to lose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>There seems to me to be a prodigious rapidity in his mind which could not be taken away without diminishing its force; and yet it is this rapidity, I think, which often offended some of my elder friends, in the form of impatience and abruptness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>He has, too, a promptness and decision which contribute, no doubt, to the general power of his mind, and certainly could not be repressed without taking away much of that zeal which carries him forward in his labors, and gives so lively an interest to his conversation; yet you could not be an hour in his presence without observing that his promptness and decision very often make him appear peremptory and assuming.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>In short, he has such a <hi rend="italics">familiar</hi> acquaintance with almost all the subjects of human knowledge, and consequently such an intimate conviction that he is right, and such a habit of carrying his point; he passes, as it seems to me, with such intuitive rapidity from thought to thought, and subject to subject,&mdash;that his mind is completely occupied and satisfied with its own knowledge and operations, and has no attention left to bestow on the tones and manners of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>He is, in fact, so much absorbed with the weightier matters of the discussion,&mdash;with the subject, the argument, and the illustrations,&mdash;that he forgets the small tithe of humility and forbearance which he owes <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> to every <num value="1">one</num> with whom he converses; and I was not <num value="1">one</num> of those who ever wished to correct his forgetfulness, or remind him of his debt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>You will gather from these desultory and diffuse remarks, that I was very much delighted with <persName n="Jeffrey,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0002.00047.00429" reg="mostcommon:Jeffrey,Francis,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jeffrey</surname></persName>. . . . . All that he knew &mdash;and, as far as I could judge, his learning is more extensive than that of any man I ever met&mdash;seemed completely incorporated and identified with his own mind; and I cannot, perhaps, give you a better idea of the readiness with which he commanded it, and of the consequent facility and fluency of his conversation, than by saying, with <persName n="Ames,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0002.00047.00430" reg="mostcommon:Ames,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ames</surname></persName>, that <q direct="unspecified">he poured it out like water.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Never was I so mistaken in my anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Instead of a tall and handsome man, as I had supposed him from his picture,&mdash;a man of severe and bitter remarks in conversation, such as I had good reason to believe him from his books, I found him a short, deformed, and ugly little man, with a large head sunk between his shoulders, and <num value="1">one</num> of his eyes turned outward, but, withal, <num value="1">one</num> of the best-natured, most open and well-bred gentlemen I have met.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>He very readily took up the subject, and defended that article, on the ground that it was part of the system of warfare which was going on at that time,&mdash;and I told him that it had been answered on the same ground, and in the same temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>As he seemed curious to know something about the answer, I told him I would send it to him; and, as he is supposed to be the author of the article in question, I could hardly have sent it to a better market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>He carried me to a handsome room over <persName n="Murray,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00058.00553" reg="mostcommon:Murray,Lindley,,,:1"><surname>Murray</surname></persName>'s bookstore, which he has fitted up as a sort of literary lounge, where authors resort to read newspapers and talk literary gossip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Here, again, my anticipations were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Instead of being deformed, as I had heard, he is remarkably well built, with the exception of his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>Instead of having a thin and rather <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> sharp and anxious face, as he has in his pictures, it is round, open, and smiling; his eyes are light, and not black; his air easy and careless, not forward and striking; and I found his manners affable and gentle, the tones of his voice low and conciliating, his conversation gay, pleasant, and interesting in an uncommon degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>I stayed with him about an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, during which the conversation wandered over many subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>He talked, of course, a great deal about <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>; wanted to know what was the state of our literature, how many universities we had, whether we had any poets whom we much valued, and whether we looked upon <persName n="Barlow,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00059.00559" reg="mostcommon:Barlow,nomatch:0"><surname>Barlow</surname></persName> as our <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00059.00560" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>He certainly feels a considerable interest in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, and says he intends to visit the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but I doubt whether it will not be indefinitely postponed, like his proposed visit to <placeName key="tgn,7000231" n="1.000 27" reg="iran">Persia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>I answered to all this as if I had spoken to a countryman, and then turned the conversation to his own poems, and particularly to his <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Bards,,English,,," id="n0230.0003.00059.00561" reg="default:Bards,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Bards</surname></persName>,</q> which he has so effectually suppressed that a copy is not easily to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>He said he wrote it when he was very young and very angry; which, he added, were <q direct="unspecified">the only circumstances under which a man would write such a satire.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>When he returned to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, he said, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Holland</foreName></persName>, who treated him with very great kindness, and <persName n="Rogers,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00059.00562" reg="mostcommon:Rogers,Samuel,,,:2"><surname>Rogers</surname></persName>, who was his friend, asked him to print no more of it, and therefore he had suppressed it. Since then, he said, he had become acquainted with the persons he had satirized, and whom he then knew only by their books,&mdash;was now the friend of <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00059.00563" reg="mostcommon:Moore,Tom,,,:2"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>, the correspondent of <persName n="Jeffrey,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00059.00564" reg="mostcommon:Jeffrey,Francis,,,:1"><surname>Jeffrey</surname></persName>, and intimate with the <rs type="place">Wordsworth school</rs>, and had a hearty liking for them all,&mdash;especially as they did not refuse to know <num value="1">one</num> who had so much abused them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>Of all the persons mentioned in this poem, there was not <num value="1">one</num>, he said, with whom he now had any quarrel, except <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Carlisle</foreName></persName>; and, as this was a family difference, he supposed it would never be settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>On every account, therefore, he was glad it was out of print; and yet he did not express the least regret when I told him that it was circulated in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> almost as extensively as his other poems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>She did not seem so pretty to me as she did the other day; but what she may have lost in regular beauty she made up in variety and expression of countenance during the conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>She is diffident,&mdash; she is very young, not more, I think, than <num value="19">nineteen</num>,&mdash;but is obviously possessed of talent, and did not talk at all for display.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>For the quarter of an hour during which I was with her, she talked upon a considerable variety of subjects,&mdash;America, of which she seemed to know considerable; of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, with something of her husband's visit there,&mdash;and spoke of all with a justness and a light good-humor that would have struck me even in <num value="1">one</num> of whom I had heard nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>With <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Byron</foreName></persName> I had an extremely pleasant and instructive <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> conversation of above an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>He is, I think, simple and unaffected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>When he speaks of his early follies, he does it with sincerity; of his journeys in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and the <rs>East</rs>, without ostentation; of his own works he talks with modesty, and of those of his rivals, or rather contemporaries, with justice, generosity, and discriminating praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>In everything, as far as I have seen him, he is unlike the characters of his own <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Harold,,Childe,,," id="n0230.0003.00064.00626" reg="default:Harold,Childe,,,"><foreName>Childe</foreName> <surname>Harold</surname></persName></q> and <q direct="unspecified">Giaour,</q> and yet, those who know him best and longest, say that these stories are but the descriptions of his early excesses, and these imaginary characters but the personification of feelings and passions which have formerly been active, but are now dormant or in abeyance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Of this, of course, I know nothing, but from accounts I have received from respectable sources, and the internal evidence, which I have always thought strongly in favor of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>This morning I talked with him of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, because I wished to know something of the modes of travelling there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>He gave me a long, minute, and interesting account of his journeys and adventures, not only in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, but in <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>; described to me the character and empire of Ali Pacha, and told me what I ought to be most anxious to see and investigate in that glorious country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>He gave me, indeed, more information on this subject than all I have before gathered from all the sources I have been able to reach; and did it, too, with so much spirit, that it came to me as an intellectual entertainment, as well as a valuable mass of instruction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>So, after the morning service, I drove out, and stayed with him until nearly <num value="9">nine</num> this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>He lives in a pleasant little box, at <placeName key="tgn,1005692" n="1.000 3" reg="sydenham,greater london,england,united kingdom,europe">Sydenham</placeName>, <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> from town, a beautiful village, which looks more like an American village than any I have seen in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>His wife is a bonny little Scotchwoman, with a great deal of natural vivacity; and his only child, a boy of about <num value="10">ten</num>, an intelligent little fellow, but somewhat injured by indulgence, I fear. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>The consequence is, that, though he is always amusing, he is not always quite natural.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>He showed me the biographical and critical sketches of the <rs>English Poets</rs> which he is printing. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Her portraits are very faithful as to her general air and outline, but no art can express or imitate the dignity of her manner or the intelligent illumination of her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Her conversation corresponded well with her person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>It is rather stately, but not, I think, affected; and, though accompanied by considerable gesture, not really overacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>She gave a lively description of the horrible ugliness and deformity of <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> the painter; told us some of her adventures in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, a year ago; and, in speaking of <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00066.00636" reg="nearbymention:Bonaparte,Napoleon,,,"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, repeated some powerful lines from the <q direct="unspecified">Venice Preserved,</q> which gave me some intimations of her powers of acting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>After she was gone, the conversation naturally turned on the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Byron</foreName></persName> asked me what actors I had heard, and, when I told him, imitated to me the manner of <persName n="Munden,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00066.00639" reg="mostcommon:Munden,nomatch:0"><surname>Munden</surname></persName>, <persName n="Braham,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00066.00640" reg="mostcommon:Braham,nomatch:0"><surname>Braham</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cooke,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00066.00641" reg="mostcommon:Cooke,G.,F.,,:1"><surname>Cooke</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Kemble,,,,," id="n0230.0003.00066.00642" reg="mostcommon:Kemble,Stephen,,,:2"><surname>Kemble</surname></persName>, with exactness, as far as I had heard them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Afterwards I had a long and singular conversation with <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Byron</foreName></persName>, in which, with that simplicity which I have uniformly found to mark <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> his character, he told me a great deal of the history of his early feelings and habits; of the impressions of extreme discontent under which he wrote <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Harold,,Childe,,," id="n0230.0003.00067.00644" reg="default:Harold,Childe,,,"><foreName>Childe</foreName> <surname>Harold</surname></persName>,</q> which he began at Joannina and finished at <placeName reg="Izmir, Izmir Ili, Ege kiyilari" key="tgn,7002543">Smyrna</placeName>; and of the extravagant intention he had formed of settling in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, which, but for the state of his affairs, that required his presence in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, he should have fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>The <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Bards,,English,,," id="n0230.0003.00067.00645" reg="default:Bards,English,,,"><foreName>English</foreName> <surname>Bards</surname></persName> and Scotch Reviewers,</q> he told me, he wrote at his paternal estate in the country, the winter before he set forth on his travels, while a heavy fall of snow was on the ground, and he kept house for a month, during which time he never saw the light of day, rising in the evening after dark, and going to bed in the morning before dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/><q direct="unspecified">The Corsair,</q> he told me, he wrote in <measure n="11days" type="date">eleven days</measure>, and copied on the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">twelfth</day></dateStruct>, and added, that whenever he undertook anything, he found it necessary to devote all his thoughts to it until he had finished it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>It is so long since he laid it aside, that he said it would now be entirely impossible for him to resume it. From some of his remarks, I think it not unlikely that he may next turn his thoughts to the stage, though it would be impossible, in a mind constituted like his, to predict the future from the present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>After all, it is difficult for me to leave him, thinking either of his early follies or his present eccentricities; for his manners are so gentle, and his whole character so natural and unaffected, that I have come from him with nothing but an indistinct, though lively impression of the goodness and vivacity of his disposition.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>They contain so full and continuous a record of his life and thoughts, that little is left for his biographer to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>They should be read, however, not merely as fresh and animated sketches of what he witnessed and felt, but as unconscious revelations of character, addressed, as they were, to his father and mother, with that frank and affectionate confidence which had always existed between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>They reveal to us a rare degree of self-denial and force of character in a young man of <num value="4">four</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num>, suddenly exchanging the loving and watchful supervision of a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> home for the absolute freedom of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but yielding to none of the temptations of his new position; devoting himself to an unbroken life of hard study, making his plans deliberately and adhering to them resolutely, and renouncing not merely all debasing but all frivolous pleasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>And from these letters and journals we also learn that his love of study was not the effect of a solitary temper or an ascetic spirit, but that he was fond of society as well as of books, that he was a social favorite, everywhere well received, and treated with marked kindness by many of the most distinguished men in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>. . . . You will perhaps expect from me some notices of <name>German</name> literature, as I am now established in the very midst of it; and if you do not, I may as well write you about it as about something not half so interesting. . . . . To come to the subject, then, and begin in defiance of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">ab ovo Ledce</hi>,&mdash;you know there are in this land of gutturals and tobacco <num value="2">two</num> dialects: high <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00087.00805" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, so called because it is indigenous in the interior and higher parts of the country; and low <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00087.00806" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>, so called because it is indigenous in the <rs>North</rs>, among the lowlands, and on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>How long these dialects have existed, it is not now possible to determine; but they are probably as old as the earliest population of the country, since traces of them have been found in <persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00087.00807" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,nomatch:0"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>The low <rs>German</rs>, which is the vernacular of the lowest class in this part of the country, is a much more harmonious and happy language in its elements than the high <rs>German</rs>, which is the language of all people of any education through the whole country, but which is a vernacular only at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>Both were equally rude, indigent, and unpolished, until the time of the <name>Reformation</name>,&mdash;the epoch from which all culture is dated in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>This great revolution accidentally gave the empire of literature to high <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00087.00808" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>It happened to be the native dialect of <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>He translated his Bible into it, wrote in it his hymns and catechisms, which are still in use, and made it the language of the pulpit and religion, and, of course, the language of letters; for in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> they have ever since been inseparably connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>The <measure n="30Years" type="date">Thirty Years</measure> War, however, which immediately followed, and wasted and degraded <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> more, perhaps, than a country was ever wasted and degraded by war before or since, effectually stopped the progress of cultivation, and to this, and to the troubles which for above a century afterwards continued to arise as often as they were appeased, from their division into religious parties and principalities, is clearly to be traced the slow progress the <name>Germans</name> made, while the nations around them were fast advancing to the luxuries of a refined literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>At length, when time and collision had worn them down to an uncomfortable kind of quietness, such as you would naturally expect from their clumsy and shapeless constitution, they began to put forth their awkward strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>Their circumstances, however, did not all favor them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>From local situation and political interest they were more connected with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> than with any other nation; and the gay splendor of literature at the <rs type="place">Court of Louis</rs> <num value="14">XIV</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>at once carried captive their imagination and taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>Nothing could be more unfortunate than this, for nothing would less apply to the rude and powerful language, and the fiery, but untempered talents of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, than the straitlaced rules of <name>French</name> criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>In this prison-house, however, the shorn and manacled strength of the land toiled half a century with ignominious skill and success; and the many monuments it has left behind are as much the subject of patriotic abhorrence and contempt at the present day as the more recent ones, which lately covered their hills, to mark their political servitude and degeneracy. . . . At length, between <dateStruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1770--"><year reg="1770">1770</year></dateStruct>, from causes which perhaps it is impossible accurately to trace and estimate, but the chief of which are certainly to be sought in the humble servitude under which it had so long suffered, <name>German</name> literature underwent a sudden and violent and total revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>It is equally difficult to determine precisely to whom is to be given the honor of leading the way in this emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> author or work must be selected, it would probably be the <q direct="unspecified">Literary Letters,</q>&mdash;a periodical publication managed by Lessing; but this was so instantly succeeded and surpassed by the earliest works of <persName n="Klopstock,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00088.00809" reg="mostcommon:Klopstock,F.,G.,,:1"><surname>Klopstock</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wieland,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00088.00810" reg="mostcommon:Wieland,nomatch:0"><surname>Wieland</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00088.00811" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,Wolfgang,A.,von,:1"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, that it is evident the spirit of regeneration had long been working in the land, and that, if Lessing was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to call it forth, it was rather from accident than extraordinary genius or boldness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>The literature of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> now sprang at once from its tardy soil, like the miraculous harvest of <persName n="Jason,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00088.00812" reg="mostcommon:Jason,nomatch:0"><surname>Jason</surname></persName>, and like that, too, seems in danger of perishing without leaving behind it successors to its greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>Besides the <num value="4">four</num> whom I have named, I know of no authors who have enjoyed a general and decisive popularity, and who have <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> settled down into regular classics, except <persName n="Haller,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00089.00813" reg="mostcommon:Haller,nomatch:0"><surname>Haller</surname></persName>, <persName n="Muller,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00089.00814" reg="mostcommon:Muller,John,von,,:1"><surname>Muller</surname></persName>, the elder <rs>Voss</rs>, <persName n="Schiller,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00089.00815" reg="mostcommon:Schiller,nomatch:0"><surname>Schiller</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Burger,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00089.00816" reg="mostcommon:Burger,nomatch:0"><surname>Burger</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>This number is certainly small, and <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00089.00817" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,Wolfgang,A.,von,:1"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName> alone survives, to maintain the glory of the deceased generation of his friends and rivals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>But, narrow as the circle is, and though the strictness of posterity will perhaps make it yet narrower, still I know of none in the modern languages&mdash;except our own&mdash;where <num value="1">one</num> so interesting can be found as the circle of <name>German</name> literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>It has all the freshness and faithfulness of poetry of the early ages, when words were still the representatives of sensible objects, and simple, sensible feelings rather than of abstractions and generalities; and yet, having flourished so late, it is by no means wanting in modern refinement and regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>In this singular state, uniting much of the force and originality of the barbarous ages to enough of the light polish of those that are more civilized, it has continued just about <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>; but in the last <num value="30">thirty</num> no considerable author has appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>Much of this barrenness is, I am persuaded, to be charged to the philosophy of <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00089.00818" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>, which for nearly <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ruled unquestioned, and absorbed and perverted all the talents of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Its empire, however, was soon gone by; but then followed the <rs>French</rs> usurpation, which overturned at pleasure the literary establishments of the land, and silenced systematically all authors who did not write as they were bidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>. . . .You tell me you have been amused with the occasional hints I have given you of the life of a student at a German university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>You shall then have more of them, and particularly an account of some events connected with this subject, which have lately occurred here under my immediate observation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>There are, at all the considerable literary establishments in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, secret associations among the students, consisting of all persons from the same country or province, which are not only connected with all similar associations at the same university, but with all similar associations throughout <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>The bond of their union is a chivalrous, or, if you please, a captious rule of honor, and its basis is <pb id="p.90" n="90"/> the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>The object is not literary, but strictly municipal, and the whole advantage is the irresistible influence which the combination can give to its decisions, either against a student or a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>At <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName>, there have been, time out of mind, <num value="7">seven</num> of these societies,&mdash;according to the <num value="7">seven</num> principal States from which the students come,&mdash;as the <name>Hanoverians</name>, the <name>Prussians</name>, the <name>Brunswickers</name>, etc. They are in defiance of the laws of the <rs type="place">University</rs>, and have often been broken up by the government, but have always reappeared under new names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Sometimes they have been called <q direct="unspecified">Orders,</q> sometimes <q direct="unspecified">Bonds of Virtue,</q> sometimes <q direct="unspecified">Clubs of Honor,</q> etc. The last were called <q direct="unspecified">Landsmannschafts,</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Associations of Countrymen.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>Their object was twofold: to settle quarrels among their members, and to defend themselves against all impositions of the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>But the great power their combination gave them proved tyranny in injudicious hands, and the members were obliged to fight duels where no offence was really given, and the citizens were punished where no injustice or fraud had been practised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>They had but <num value="2">two</num> modes of proceeding, and both were sufficiently summary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>If <num value="1">one</num> member was offended with another, his society compelled him to fight a duel, appointed the seconds and the witnesses, and saw that satisfaction was properly given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>To be sure, these duels hardly deserve so imposing a name, for they were fought with such weapons and such armor that they were seldom bloody and could never be fatal; but still their number was so considerable that they were absolutely a nuisance, for every slight offence was settled by them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mode; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> was when a member offended the club, or a citizen a member, and then the punishment was by <q direct="unspecified">verschuss,</q> or non-intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>If, for instance, a tradesman had cheated a student, if his landlord had treated him unkindly, or anybody with whom he had connection had offended him, he complained to his club.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>If they found the complaint supported and sufficient, the offender was put into <q direct="unspecified">verschuss,</q>&mdash;that is, no student was allowed to have anything to do with him. If he was a shopkeeper, his custom was gone; if he was a <hi rend="italics">restaurateur</hi>, nobody would have his dinner from him, any more than if he sent out poison; and if he let rooms, nobody would take lodgings of him. In short, whatever might be the occupation of the offender, it was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>Instances of this sort of punishment are not at all rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>Last year, a student, for having spoken disrespectfully of the <q direct="unspecified">Landsmannschaft,</q> was put under the ban of the <rs>Empire</rs>, and, after braving the whole University some weeks, and its marked contempt, went to <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipsic</placeName>, but found himself received <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> there with the same injuries, and was finally obliged to change his name and go to <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>A baker, who had done nothing worse than sue a student for his regular bill, was put into <q direct="unspecified">verschuss,</q> and, after striving in vain to live independently of the students in a town supported entirely by them, found himself so much in debt, that in despair he shot himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>And the very man in whose house I live, having offended a student in his capacity of confectioner, was compelled, above a year since, to let his shop to another, and has been starving on its rent in the vain hope that the students will at last give up the persecution; but he has just sold it in despair.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>These are the bad effects of this remarkable system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>That it has its good effects also, you will easily believe; for, if it had not, it would not be tolerated a moment by the government, and indeed could not long exist among a large body of young men who are really studious and regular to a remarkable degree, and whose notions of justice are, like those of all young men, essentially pure and unperverted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>The advantages of the system are, that it gives a character and <hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi> to the whole motley mass of the students, which, in universities like these in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, could not otherwise be given to them; that it enables the pro-rector and professors, by governing a few of the heads of the clubs, to control the entire multitude under them more effectually than the laws will enable, or the spirit of the institution permit them to do directly; and that it introduces in their behavior to <num value="1">one</num> another, and their conduct to the government, a degree of order and decorum, and a general gentlemanly spirit, which nothing else can give to a <num value="1000">thousand</num> young men brought together where they have no responsibility, at an age when they have not yet learnt to behave well without a superior influence in some sort to compel to it. The evils, on the contrary, are the captious rules of honor which are maintained by it among the students, terminating in innumerable contemptible duels, and occasionally a flagrant injustice to a citizen,&mdash;though certainly to the citizens it does much more good than harm, for they are much more disposed and interested to cheat the students than the students can be to oppress them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>On the whole, therefore, the system seems to me to be bad, and <num value="1">one</num> which ought to be exterminated, though at the same time I must confess to you that many of the professors think otherwise, and are persuaded that, while the laws of the <rs type="place">University</rs> are so loose and weak, the students must have a municipal system of their own. <pb id="p.92" n="92"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>Much undoubtedly depends on the government for the time being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>Under a vigilant pro-rector, who prevents these clubs from gaining too much strength or boldness, they may do good; but under such pro-rectors as professors may commonly be expected to be, who are interested to preserve their own popularity, and especially under a decidedly weak pro-rector, they must do much mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>This has lately been the case here.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>During the year ending in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, the pro-rectorship had fallen to <num value="2">two</num> professors who did anything rather than execute the duties of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> magistrates of the <rs type="place">University</rs>, and, of course, during their government these secret <q direct="unspecified">Landsmannschafts</q> had increased in boldness until their existence and acts were as notorious as those of the academical senate; and the duels multiplied till, contemptible as they are individually, they became an intolerable nuisance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>Just at this time <persName n="Mitscherlich,Professor,,,," id="n0230.0005.00092.00821" reg="mostcommon:Mitscherlich,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Mitscherlich</surname></persName>, the editor of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, became in his turn pro-rector, and proved to be as much too severe as his predecessors had been too feeble and lax. He cited at once many students for inconsiderable and forgotten offences, committed under the reign of the last pro-rectors, and was going on to purge the <rs>University</rs> of its follies more thoroughly than was prudent, or even desirable, when an event occurred which gave a higher direction to his inquiries and punishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/>A student quarrelled with his club in the following manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>A house had been put into <q direct="unspecified">verschuss,</q> and a student being found still to frequent it, the sentence he had violated fell on himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>Exasperated at this, he threatened, if he were not reinstated, to expose the whole secret system to the pro-rector.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>You will easily imagine that this injudicious threat produced exactly the opposite effect from what he had intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>He was excommunicated with book and bell, and received with contempt and injuries where-ever he went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>Still further enraged at what he ought to have expected, he actually sent a regular and ample memoir to the prorector, and fled the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>The moment the fact was known, or rather suspected, such a sensation was excited as no <num value="1">one</num> can imagine who did not witness it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>There was no tumult or violence, but the whole appearance of the city was changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>The streets, always before filled only with young men hastening to their lectures, were now crowded with little <q direct="unspecified">assemblages,</q> as <persName n="Gerry,Governor,,,," id="n0230.0005.00092.00822" reg="mostcommon:Gerry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Gerry</surname></persName> would call them, so that it was difficult to pass on the sidewalks; the benches in the lecture-rooms, where a vacant seat was a rarity, grew visibly thin and empty, and wherever you met a student he had the hurried and anxious air of a <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> man of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>The whole character of things was altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> determination was to have personal vengeance on the traitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>Guards were posted on the roads to prevent his escape; for <num value="2">two</num> nights a watch of <num value="300">three hundred</num> patrolled the ramparts and the streets; and if he had been caught, he might have escaped with his life, but he would have boasted of nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>Fortunately his prudence, or that of the pro-rector, had secured his flight before his treason was suspected, and he has not since been seen or heard of. His information, however, has enabled the pro-rector to arrest the heads of the clubs, and possess himself of their records, where he found a regular list of all the officers and members, amounting to between <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="600">six hundred</num>; and, among other curious documents, seized a protocol containing a detailed account of <num value="96">ninety-six</num> of these harmless duels fought in <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>So full a discovery precluded all subterfuge or defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>After a week of excitement and cabal, during which all study was suspended, and there was a kind of reign of terror in the <rs type="place">University</rs>, the most prominent members of the clubs began to leave the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>This was immediately prevented by a public ordinance, laying them all under city arrest, and forbidding them to go out of the city gates under any pretence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>This excited a new effervescence, for it indeed was a measure of needless severity, and fell upon the just as well as the unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>New councils were held, and after much deliberation a deputation was sent to the government at <placeName reg="Hannover, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002450">Hanover</placeName>, praying for its interference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>This, however, produced no effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>He is still a young man of hardly <num value="30">thirty</num>, and yet has been already called as professor to <num value="3">three</num> universities, and is looked upon here as superior to <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00095.00829" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/>I desired to have <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> a week of him, to pursue the literary history of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> systematically, under his direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1269"/>This, however, he declined, saying that what he could do for me in this way he should not consider as instruction, but as an amusement; and therefore, if I would come every week and spend <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> evenings with him, his advice and assistance would always be at my service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>I commonly go, therefore, once or twice in the week at <time value="8pm">eight in the evening</time> to him, and if I get home before <num value="11">eleven</num> I think I am early, though I have trespassed beyond my rule.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>His prodigious learning has not by its amount impaired the freshness of his feelings, or quenched an enthusiasm which is so lively as to be even injurious to his feeble constitution, nor by its minuteness prevented him from having the most general and philosophical views of the nature and objects of his profession; while at the same time he has a deep religious sensibility, of which I know no other example here, and an earnest and prevalent desire to impart his learning and do good, which consecrates all his exertions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>I forgot at the moment to answer this inquiry, and should perhaps have forgotten it still longer, if I had not last week read his <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> pamphlet in the controversy with <persName n="Worcester,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00835" reg="mostcommon:Worcester,nomatch:0"><surname>Worcester</surname></persName>; and the natural desire which this excited, of recalling myself to the memory of <num value="1">one</num> who had just given me so much pleasure, reminded me of his wish, and I determined to take the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> leisure hour I should find to fulfil it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>In the first place, it is necessary to take a few dates, to see how rapidly the metaphysical systems have followed each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>From <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct> <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00836" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName> ruled unquestioned through all <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>For <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> succeeding, <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00837" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName> was the lord of the ascendant, till <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00838" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName> pushed him from his stool, and kept it a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>But before <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct> had closed, a rebellion of common-sense through the land had dispossessed them all, and since that no <num value="1">one</num> has succeeded to their influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>Of their systems it is not necessary to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>It is only necessary to know that <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00839" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName> and <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00840" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName> divided the system of <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00841" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>, and that the <num value="1">one</num>, by pushing his idealism too far, in the <name>German</name> phrase, made Nature independent of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, or undeified Nature; while the other, being a man of poetical feeling, went into the other extreme, and almost identified <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and Nature,&mdash;so that before the defeat of <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00842" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>'s system as a whole, and then in both parts separately, his school came to a total bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1285"/>In this state you must now consider <name>German</name> metaphysics, taken as a system, or a collection of systems, and in this state they must remain till some man of high talents comes forward, like <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00096.00843" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>, at once to destroy and to build up.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/>But you will ask whether these systems and revolutions left no traces behind them which are still visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1287"/>Certainly, very many and very important ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1288"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, you may observe an extreme excitement in the minds of the <name>Germans</name> upon all metaphysical subjects, produced by such rapid and important revolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1289"/>These <num value="3">three</num> great metaphysicians were men of very rare endowments, of uncommon weight and force of talents, and to the sort of uproar and tumult in which they kept the country for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, is undoubtedly to be traced no inconsiderable portion of that general metaphysical <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> activity and acuteness, and that spirit of philosophical vehemence, which now distinguish <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> from all other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>I mean that vehement exertion which is now making to have all sciences and knowledge reduced to philosophical systems, which is certainly doing wonders in some respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1291"/>And, secondly, you may observe an extreme unwillingness to receive any new system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1292"/>The whole generation, in this respect, seem like men who have just come out from a long campaign, and are pleased with nothing less than the thought of beginning a new <num value="1">one</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1293"/>To these <num value="2">two</num> consequences of the success and failure of <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00844" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00845" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00846" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName>, is, I think, in a great measure to be traced the present condition of metaphysics in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1294"/>Within the lives of the present generation of instructors, these <num value="3">three</num> systems have had their respective triumphs, and of course every <num value="1">one</num> who wishes to be thought a metaphysician must lay the very foundation of his pretensions in a thorough knowledge of them all. But within the same period, too, they have all been exploded, and of course every <num value="1">one</num> who recollects the mortification of that fall will be careful how he exposes himself to a similar fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1295"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> makes them thorough, deep, and acute; the last makes them cautious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1296"/>The consequence of both is that the number of powerful metaphysicians in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> is at this moment very great, and that they are almost all eclectic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>I do not mean, when I talk of the overthrow of these <num value="3">three</num> systems, that no adherents to them are now to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>Far from it. In <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipsic</placeName>, where revolutions in modes of thinking are effected with difficulty, perhaps the majority of those who examine such subjects are still followers of <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00847" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>In <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, where <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00848" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName> still lives and has lately much distinguished himself by some very powerful pieces to arouse and sustain the <name>Prussian</name> spirit against the <rs>French</rs> usurpation, his philosophy has still some active friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>And, in <placeName reg="Jena, Gera, Thuringen" key="tgn,7005973">Jena</placeName>, the feelings awakened by <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00849" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName>'s eloquence and enthusiasm have not yet grown cold.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>But, after all, the number is comparatively small, and the spirit feeble; and if you go through <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> and take the whole mass of metaphysicians together, you will rarely, <hi rend="italics">very</hi> rarely, find <num value="1">one</num> who professes himself of either of the schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Particularly at the universities, you will find that each <num value="1">one</num> has a system of his own, collected from the <hi rend="italics">disjecta membra</hi> of the systems of <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00850" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00851" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Schelling,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00097.00852" reg="mostcommon:Schelling,nomatch:0"><surname>Schelling</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>These fragments he has commonly formed, with his own additions, into a more or less harmonious whole, to which his hearers <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> listen with all due attention and reverence, but in which they trust hardly more than in the forgotten heresies of <persName n="Leibnitz,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00098.00853" reg="mostcommon:Leibnitz,Mss,,,:1"><surname>Leibnitz</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00098.00854" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,F.,A.,,:1"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>So that you may set it down as an almost universal fact that the teachers and disciples are alike eclectics.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>A young man at the university commonly gets this freedom by hearing <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> different professors expound and defend as many different systems.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>This is a very remarkable, but I am not ready to say an unfortunate state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>The worthiest object of metaphysical studies is to excite and enlarge the faculties, and form deep and thorough thinkers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>Never was this so completely and so generally effected as it now is in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>; and, as the object is attained, why should we complain or regret that it is not done by the means which we have usually considered indispensable?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/>The <rs>Germans</rs> reproach the <rs>English</rs> with treating such subjects psychologically, or, in other words, not sufficiently distinguishing the difference between ideas and sensations; and the <rs>English</rs> reply that the <name>Germans</name> are unintelligible idealists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>The difference between the <num value="2">two</num> is very great, and, moreover, it is, I think, a natural and constitutional difference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, from the character of the people and the nature of the government, which for a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> have been continually acting and reacting upon each other, many things must be made to serve some <hi rend="italics">practical</hi> purpose, and nothing is valued which is not <hi rend="italics">immediately</hi> useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, on the contrary, the national character, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation of it in <persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00098.00859" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,nomatch:0"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName>, and the tendency of the government, from its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> development to the present day, have always had an effect directly opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>A man of science here lives entirely isolated from the world; and the very republic of letters, which is a more real body in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> than it ever was in any other country, has no connection with the many little governments through which it is scattered without being broken or divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>From this separation of the practical affairs from science and letters to the extraordinary degree in which it is done in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, comes, I think, the theoretical nature of <name>German</name> literature in general, and of <name>German</name> metaphysics in particular.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>This is the way in which I account for the origin and prevalence of <persName n="Locke,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00098.00860" reg="mostcommon:Locke,nomatch:0"><surname>Locke</surname></persName>'s system of sensations, and <persName n="Hartley,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00098.00861" reg="mostcommon:Hartley,nomatch:0"><surname>Hartley</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Priestley,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00098.00862" reg="mostcommon:Priestley,nomatch:0"><surname>Priestley</surname></persName>'s materialism <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> in the <num value="1">one</num> country, and <persName n="Kant,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00099.00863" reg="mostcommon:Kant,nomatch:0"><surname>Kant</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Fichte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00099.00864" reg="mostcommon:Fichte,nomatch:0"><surname>Fichte</surname></persName>'s high, abstract idealism in the other; because in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the man of letters must be more or less a practical man; in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, he is necessarily as pure a theorist or idealist as the <name>Greeks</name> were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>But, whether my explanation of the cause be right or wrong, the fact remains unquestionable, and the next thing you will desire to know, will be the effects of this system of things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>They are undoubtedly manifold; more perhaps than I suspect, and certainly more than the <name>Germans</name> themselves believe; but <num value="2">two</num> are very obvious, and more important probably than all the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is an extreme freedom, and, as I should call it, latitudinarianism in thinking, speaking, writing, and teaching on all subjects, even law, religion, and politics, with the single exception of the actual measures of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>A more perfect freedom, and in most cases a more perfect use and indulgence of it, cannot be imagined than is now to be found in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>; and nobody can read the books published, without observing their high abstract nature, and seeing that their free tone is derived almost, perhaps altogether, from the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of the prevalent metaphysics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> is an extreme mental activity, produced by the necessity which every scholar has felt himself under to understand all <num value="3">three</num> of the great systems which, within the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, everybody has been obliged to talk about; and then a consequent necessity that he who writes a book must, whatever be his subject, write it in a philosophical, discriminating spirit, and on a broad and systematic plan.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>On this last are founded the chief improvements which the <name>Germans</name> are now making in literature and science, and both are to be almost exclusively attributed to the peculiar character of their metaphysics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>These, then, are the <num value="2">two</num> most important results of the <name>German</name> metaphysics: the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, bad in the extravagance to which it is now carried; and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, essentially good, and continually tending, I think,&mdash;unless my views of human nature are too favorable,&mdash;to diminish and extirpate the evil of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, however, from the force of circumstances and character, a literary democracy has found full room to thrive and rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>Here, there can be no broad system of patronage, for the people are too poor and the governments too inconsiderable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>The splendor of a court can have no influence where there is no metropolis; and as for tyranny, I do not think it has ever pressed very hard on <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, except in the <rs>French</rs> times; and they were too short to produce a lasting effect, especially as the reaction has been so violent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>The men of letters here, therefore, have always been dependent for their bread and reputation on their own unassisted and unembarrassed talents and exertions; and as the higher and more responsible classes about the courts, etc., have always spoken a different language, and had different feelings, manners, and views, and a different literature (I mean <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00100.00868" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, which, however, is now going out of fashion), the men of letters gradually became separated from the active and political men, until at last this division became so distinct and perfect that they formed an entirely separate class through all the <rs>German States</rs>, and have long since ceased to be amenable to any influence but that of the general opinion of their own body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>In this way, a genuine republic of letters arose in the north of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it comprehended but a small portion of the territories of the unwieldy empire, hardly more than <placeName reg="Saxony" key="tgn,7003685">Saxony</placeName>, <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Hannover" key="tgn,1002450">Hanover</placeName>, and the small States lying round them; but, as Protestant learning and philosophical modes of thinking and liberal universities were extended, the limits of this invisible empire extended with them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>The <rs>German</rs> and reformed portion of <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> soon came in; soon after <placeName reg="Danmark, Europe, " key="tgn,1000066">Denmark</placeName>, and then a part of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>; and now, lately, the king of <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>, by the establishment of gymnasia, and an academy <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> on the <name>German</name> system, and by calling in the <name>Protestants</name> of the <rs>North</rs> to help him, has set his improvements in motion, and <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName>, by founding <name>German</name> universities and appointing <name>German</name> professors to them, have almost brought <placeName reg="Bayern" key="tgn,7003669">Bavaria</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName> into the league of letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>In this way, without noise and almost without notice, from <placeName reg="Bern, Bern, Schweiz" key="tgn,7007557">Berne</placeName> to <placeName reg="Sankt-Peterburg, Sankt-Peterburg, Rossiya" key="tgn,7010273">St. Petersburg</placeName>, and from <placeName key="tgn,7004333" n="1.000 3" reg="munchen,oberbayern,bayern,deutschland,europe">Munich</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7003474" n="1.000 2" reg="kobenhavn,kobenhavn,danmark,europe">Copenhagen</placeName>, a republic has been formed, extending through all the great and small governments, and independent of the influence of them all, which by its activity unites all the interests of learning, while by its extent it prevents low prejudice from so often oppressing individual merit; and finally, by its aggregate power resting, as it must, on general opinion, it is able to exert a force which nothing that naturally comes under its influence can resist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>I could give you many curious instances and proofs of the efficiency of this system, and of its power to separate the men of letters from the other classes of society in their opinions and feelings; but I have room for only <num value="2">two</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>When you talk with a man in civil life of his country, you will find that he means that peculiar and independent district in which he was born, as <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Hessen, Deutschland, Europe" key="tgn,7003678">Hesse</placeName>, etc.; and you will find, too, that his patriotic attachment to this spot is often as exclusive and vehement as that of <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n0230.0005.00101.00869" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> or a true American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>But talk with a man of letters, and you will instantly perceive that when he speaks of his country he is really thinking of all that portion of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, and the neighboring territories, through which Protestant learning and a philosophical mode of thinking are diffused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>Nay, further, take a Prussian, or <placeName reg="Hanoverian">Hanoverian</placeName>, or Hessian politician or soldier, and he will talk with as much horror of expatriation from <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Hannover" key="tgn,1002450">Hanover</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Hessen, Deutschland, Europe" key="tgn,7003678">Hesse</placeName> as <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00101.00870" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,Lucien,,,:3"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> ever did of <q direct="unspecified">denationalizing</q> a flag; but a professor or a rector of a gymnasium moves as willingly from <num value="1">one</num> of these countries into another, and feels himself as much at home after his removal, as if it were only from <persName n="Cassel,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00101.00871" reg="mostcommon:Cassel,nomatch:0"><surname>Cassel</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Marburg, Giessen, Hessen" key="tgn,7012330">Marburg</placeName>, or from <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName> to <placeName reg="Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt, Deutschland" key="tgn,7017168">Halle</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>My <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proof is, that they not only feel themselves to belong to an independent body of men, but are really considered to be so by the several governments under which they happen to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/>I do not now refer to the unlimited freedom of the universities, and the modes of instruction there, which make each professor independent; I refer merely to the mode in which professors are removed from <num value="1">one</num> country to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/>The king of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> would not appoint to any military or civil service, or even to any clerical office in his dominions, any but a Prussian; the king of <placeName reg="Hannover, Niedersachsen, Deutschland" key="tgn,1002450">Hanover</placeName>, any but a <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> <placeName reg="Hanoverian">Hanoverian</placeName>, etc.; but if a man of letters is wanted, all such distinctions are not even thought of; nor is it the least reproach to the person appointed, or the least offence to his government, that he is seduced from his native country, though it certainly would be the highest in the other cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>Thus <persName n="Eichhorn,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00102.00872" reg="mostcommon:Eichhorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Eichhorn</surname></persName> was brought from <placeName reg="Weimar, Erfurt, Thuringen" key="tgn,7012886">Weimar</placeName>; Boeckh, now so famous in <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, was a Hanoverian; <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00102.00873" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName> was a Saxon; Buhle, the editor of <persName><foreName>Aristotle</foreName></persName>, is in <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, etc.; and new instances of this sort are occurring every day through the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>From that moment the character of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> began to change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>The means were no sooner wanted than they were found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/>More freedom was gradually given to the lower classes; more schools were established for their instruction; societies were formed under the direction of the government whose object was to promote industry, order, and economy among the people; and finally the king founded a new university at <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, from which a free spirit has gone forth that has wrought like a fever through all <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>In short, all the talents, influence, and activity which the councils of the king could command, were directly applied to repress luxury, to promote industry, and to diffuse information among the people, and thus give a new moral character to the whole nation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/>Such designs were suited to the spirit of the times, and they therefore succeeded beyond the hopes of those who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conceived them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/>It was in this way that <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> was gradually and systematically prepared for emancipation, and enabled to act with more vigor and success when that moment arrived.

Every day he has something new and strange to tell; and as he takes a particular delight in teasing me, he commonly relates something out of the way respecting our <persName n="Indians,,North American,,," id="n0230.0005.00104.00881" reg="default:Indians,North American,,,"><foreName>North American</foreName> <surname>Indians</surname></persName>, which by a dexterous turn he contrives to make those present think is equally true of the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and ends by citing some of the strange opinions of <persName n="Buffon,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00104.00882" reg="mostcommon:Buffon,nomatch:0"><surname>Buffon</surname></persName> or <persName n="Raynal,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00104.00883" reg="mostcommon:Raynal,nomatch:0"><surname>Raynal</surname></persName> to support himself, and put me out of countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>Of course we come at once into a regular discussion, in which he goes on to allege more perverse authorities against me, calls us a younger and feebler creation, says that we have not yet freed ourselves from the rude manners of the wilderness, etc., etc. This soon finishes with a general laugh, sometimes against <num value="1">one</num> side, sometimes against the other, though oftenest, I think, against me; for, if I have the best of the argument, he always has, and always will have, the best of the joke.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>This, however, though it ends the discussion for the time, does not finally conclude it. The next day the old gentleman comes with his books and authorities to support all he had said the day before; and this he is generally able to do by some means or other, for there is nothing so absurd that has not at some time been said about us; and though he knows as well as anybody what is true, and what is exaggerated or false, he proceeds at once to argue for victory and not for truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>Still, with all his inexhaustible learning, he is often unable to find perverse authorities enough to support what in a moment of thoughtless humor he has said merely to tease me; and so, to supply what is wanting in the <hi rend="italics">litera scripta</hi>, he invents extemporaneously whatever suits his immediate purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Thus, a few days ago, as I had denied that the <rs>Americans</rs> use the <rs>Indian</rs> steam-baths made by pouring water upon hot stones, the old gentleman had come with a curious letter of <persName n="Penn,,William,,," id="n0230.0005.00104.00884" reg="default:Penn,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Penn</surname></persName>'s on the subject, which he read aloud in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00104.00885" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>; but as this went no further than to the <name>Indians</name>, and not to the whites, he adroitly inserted a sentence or <num value="2">two</num> gratis, from which it seemed the practice was common in <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>;</hi> and he did the thing so admirably that I did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suspect the trick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> afterwards he undertook to play off a similar joke with a French book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>But, as I had luckily remarked that it was printed in <dateStruct value="1588--"><year reg="1588">1588</year></dateStruct>, above <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> colonists came to <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, I obtained at once a famous victory, and turned the laugh decidedly against him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>Yesterday <num value="1">one</num> of the servants of the library came to my room with <num value="3">three</num> huge quartos, and <persName n="Blumenbach,Professor,,,," id="n0230.0005.00104.00886" reg="mostcommon:Blumenbach,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Blumenbach</surname></persName>'s compliments, saying they <pb id="p.105" n="105"/> were too large to bring to dinner, and therefore he sent them for his own justification, with marks put in where his authorities were to be found,&mdash;the whole of which were manifest falsehoods or exaggerations; but they served him as sufficient ground for crying an <hi rend="italics">Io triumphe</hi> when we met at <time value="12pm">noon</time>. In this way we have been going on these <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12days" type="date">twelve days</measure>, and I suppose shall continue to go on so till the ladies come back from Ems; so that you see I am not likely to relapse into low spirits for want of gay society and occasional excitement.</p>

His history is curious, and is an explanation of his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>He studied here when he was very poor and wretched, and, as he says in some of his publications, ill-treated by <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00890" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occupation was, I think, an inferior place at <placeName reg="Ilfeld, Erfurt, Thuringen" key="tgn,1036989">Ilfeld</placeName>, from which <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00891" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName> caused him to be expelled, no doubt with justice, for his excesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>He then went as pro-rector to an inconsiderable gymnasium at <placeName key="tgn,1049330" n="1.000 10" reg="Ostroda,Warminsko-Mazurskie,Polska,Europe">Osterode</placeName>, in the <name>Hartz</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>There he lived for some time unnoticed and unknown, till he attracted attention by his edition of <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00892" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName>'s Symposium, which is the more extraordinary, as the notes are in <persName n="German,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00893" reg="mostcommon:German,nomatch:0"><surname>German</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>This gave him a professorship at <placeName reg="Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt, Deutschland" key="tgn,7017168">Halle</placeName>, to whose spirit his talents and temper were adapted, and where he at once made himself a name and influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>In <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct> he published his Prolegomena to <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00894" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>,&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of the most important works ever written on a philological subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>Then followed his bitter contest with <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00895" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName>, who was willing to claim for himself a part of the honors of the revolution in philology which this work effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>It ended with the triumph of <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00896" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,F.,A.,,:1"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName>, though in the course of the controversy he discovered feelings which made good men regret that <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00897" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName> should have been defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>When <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00898" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName>'s Iliad came out, in <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00899" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,F.,A.,,:1"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName> and <persName n="Voss,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00900" reg="mostcommon:Voss,J.,H.,,:1"><surname>Voss</surname></persName> published <num value="1">one</num> of the most cruel and scurrilous reviews of it that ever flowed from the gall of offended pride, to which <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00901" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName> replied by a vignette in his <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName> of <dateStruct value="1806--"><year reg="1806">1806</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>After this, <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00105.00902" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,F.,A.,,:1"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName> seems to have been tolerably quiet at <placeName reg="Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt, Deutschland" key="tgn,7017168">Halle</placeName>, till the <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> change was made by the <rs>French</rs>, when he went to <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, with the title of <q direct="unspecified">Geheinerrath,</q> and a salary of <num value="2500">2,500</num> thalers and no duties, and now lives there, in his old age, in a kind of <hi rend="italics">otium cum dignitate</hi>, which is almost singular in the annals of <name>German</name> universities, and which is the envy of his coadjutors and rivals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>As a man of letters and learning, I know of few living for whom I have so great a veneration as for <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00903" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,F.,A.,,:1"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>In genius he surpasses, perhaps, nearly all the philologists who have lived, and in learning and acuteness is behind very few. A genuine laziness and love of ease, however, have prevented him from publishing much; but what he has published has become a canon,&mdash;as his text of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00904" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, though he gives no notes to support his alterations; his rules of criticism, in his Prolegomena, though not carried out and exemplified; his editions of Herodian, and of the <name>Disp</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>Tusculanae, etc., etc.,&mdash;all things of little compass, but pregnant with important consequences and changes. . . . . His course for <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00905" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> was commonly attended by <num value="180">180</num> to <num value="200">200</num>, and I am persuaded that very few professors, in any faculty, have delivered so great a variety of lectures as he has, with such skill, thoroughness, and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>I do not know what more could be desired of him, but that he should have published more, and should not have ceased to instruct.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>But the more I admire him as a scholar, the more I dislike him as a man . . . . He has openly quarrelled with most of his friends; he disgraced himself by his political conduct when the <rs>French</rs> were in <placeName reg="Halle, Sachsen-Anhalt, Deutschland" key="tgn,7017168">Halle</placeName>; and he has sunk from all respect by his vices in old age . . . . . In intercourse I have found him pleasant, chiefly from his boldness and originality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>His remarks on all subjects are striking and often new; he is arrogant and vain, talks much of himself, and repeated to me with ill-concealed satisfaction a remark he had found in the <rs>Classical Journal</rs>, published in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 8" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, that they knew of only <num value="2">two</num> scholars now on the <name>Continent</name>,&mdash;Wyttenbach and <persName n="Wolf,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00906" reg="mostcommon:Wolf,F.,A.,,:1"><surname>Wolf</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Of his enemies he never spoke, unless it were once of <persName n="Voss,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00907" reg="mostcommon:Voss,J.,H.,,:1"><surname>Voss</surname></persName>, whose translation of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00908" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> he ridiculed; and, though by a strange accident I walked with him this afternoon to the tomb of <persName n="Heyne,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00106.00909" reg="mostcommon:Heyne,nomatch:0"><surname>Heyne</surname></persName>, it seemed to excite in him no feeling but curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>To like such a man is impossible; but as a matter of curiosity I must say that, during the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, in which I have been often and long with him, he has very much amused me.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>He was curious about this country, and questioned me about our scholars and the amount of our scholarship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>I told him what I could,&mdash;amongst other things, of a fashionable, dashing preacher of New York having told me that he took great pleasure in reading the choruses of <persName n="Aeschylus,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00107.00911" reg="mostcommon:Aeschylus,nomatch:0"><surname>Aeschylus</surname></persName>, and that he read them without a dictionary!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is, the amount of compensation offered to me. This is a salary of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> and fees, which, from the present state of literature among us, cannot in <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> exceed from <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> to <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> more; so that from the professorship I cannot expect above <measure n="1300dollars" type="currency">$1,300</measure>, or at most <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>This is enough for me, as long as I continue unmarried, and I could live upon it as contentedly as upon <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">$10,000</measure> a year; but I am now making an arrangement for life; and, though I <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> assure you my hopes have not fixed on any particular person, yet I know very well that in any country, and most of all in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, marriage is a <hi rend="italics">sine qua non</hi> to happiness, and that there are not many persons to whom it would be more necessary than to me. This, then, is the condition to which I ought to look forward; but for this the professorship is no sufficient provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>I cannot, therefore, accept it, unless you are able and willing to make up the income to the amount necessary to support a family.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> point is, the <rs>Spanish</rs> part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Here is at once a new subject of study proposed to me, to which I have paid no attention since I have been here, and which I have not taken into the plan of my studies and travels in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>If I am to be a professor in this literature, I must go to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>; and this I cannot think of doing, without your full and free consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>This winter I must remain here, of course; the next summer I must be in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName>, and the next winter in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>I willingly give up <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, but still I find no room for <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>If I go there as soon as the spring will make it proper, in <dateStruct value="1818--"><year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, and establish myself at the <rs type="place">University of Salamanca</rs>, and stay there <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, which is the shortest time in which I could possibly get a suitable knowledge of Spanish literature, my whole time will be absorbed, and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName> will be sacrificed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>This last I ought not to do; and yet, the thought of staying <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> longer from home is absolutely intolerable to me. If it comes to my mind when I sit down to dinner, my appetite is gone; or when I am going to bed, I get no sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Yet, if I take this place, I must do it, and I do not question I could carry it properly through; for, after the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> here, I do not fear anything in this way; or at least ought not to; but are <hi rend="italics">you</hi> willing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>Without your consent, I will not for an instant think of it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>Finally, are you satisfied with the office and the occupation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>For myself, I say freely, that the occupation would be pleasant to me, and that I doubt not, in this office, I could, better than in any other, fulfil my duties to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and my neighbor; but still, if you be not satisfied, I do not desire it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>The case, then, stands precisely thus: you, my dear father, have done so much for me, and have made so many sacrifices for me, that I have no other wish than so to spend the remainder of the time we may live together in the world as will most promote your happiness and my mother's. An offer is made to me of an establishment for life, which necessarily implies farther exertions and sacrifices on your part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>I do not ask them, I do not desire them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>I can live happy <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> with you at home, and easily earn in some other way the support that may be necessary for me. If, however, you, of your own accord, desire me to accept this office, and <hi rend="italics">willingly</hi> make the sacrifices that are necessary to it; if you are disposed to add to the income what is necessary to support a family; if you are disposed to have me yet another half-year absent, so as to make in all <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>; and, finally, if you are willing that I should live separated from you the greater part of the year,&mdash;I will accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>I send you, therefore, <num value="2">two</num> letters for the <rs>President</rs>: <num value="1">one</num> affirmative, <num value="1">one</num> negative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>Choose, dear father and mother, whichever you please, and be assured your choice will make me happy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>If you had mentioned the subject in your letters, or if from <persName n="Cogswell,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00118.01023" reg="mostcommon:Cogswell,Joseph,Green,,:2"><surname>Cogswell</surname></persName> I could have gained a hint of your wishes, I should have sent but <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>As it is, your decision cannot be difficult, since in either case it must be proper.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>I thank you for them, as I do in my heart for all your letters, and read them with grateful pleasure throughout, even that part of your last in which you abuse the <name>German</name> literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>You must, however, permit me to answer this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/><q direct="unspecified">I am an elder soldier, not a better,</q> and may claim to be heard on the ground of experience, if not of disinterestedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>If anybody chooses to say the literature of <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> is poor, feeble, good for nothing, etc., I have no disposition to disturb him in his opinion,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">chacun &agrave; son gout</hi>. He cannot enjoy what I can,&mdash;and I, on the other hand, no doubt, am incapable of some pleasures which he perceives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>But when a man comes out like the author of a <q direct="unspecified">Review of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00118.01026" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,Wolfgang,A.,von,:1"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>'s Life,</q> and says <persName n="Schiller,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00118.01027" reg="mostcommon:Schiller,nomatch:0"><surname>Schiller</surname></persName> is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> genius <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName> has produced, or, like yourself, that <name>German</name> poetry is obscure, artificial, etc., I am bold to say, with all due respect, the man knows nothing about the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>Again, if a man says, <q direct="unspecified">I am going to give an account of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00118.01028" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,Wolfgang,A.,von,:1"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>'s life, as he himself represents it,</q> and then draws a caricature of it, as is done by the <rs>Edinburgh Review</rs>, I say he is dishonest, without entering into the question whether the book is defensible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>Or, if, like the author of the <q direct="unspecified">Review of the <rs>Ancient German Poetry</rs>,</q> he says, Bouterweck's book on this subject is indifferent, <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> I reply, without inquiring whether the judgment be accidentally right or not, that the man is a scoundrel, for <hi rend="italics">every</hi> fact and <hi rend="italics">every</hi> opinion in his Review is pilfered from this very book, and he evidently knows nothing of the early history of <name>German</name> literature which he has not found in it. Yet this is the way the <name>Germans</name> are every day judged by foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>Fortunately, however, the grounds of accusation are so different that all cannot be true, and their incoherence and inconsistency are the best possible testimony to the ignorance of the persons who make them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>To-day comes a Frenchman, and cries out, like <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01029" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,Lucien,,,:3"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, against the <q direct="unspecified">metaphysique tenebreuse <persName n="Nord,,du,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01030" reg="mostcommon:Nord,du,,,:1"><foreName>du</foreName> <surname>Nord</surname></persName></q>; to-morrow comes another Frenchman, like <persName n="Villers,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01031" reg="mostcommon:Villers,nomatch:0"><surname>Villers</surname></persName>, and says he will build a bridge that shall conduct the empirics of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> to the simplicity of <name>German</name> philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>Mad. <persName n="de Stael,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01032" reg="mostcommon:de Stael,nomatch:0"><surname>de Stael</surname></persName> complains of <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01033" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,Wolfgang,A.,von,:1"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>'s tragedies for being too simple, and the <rs>Edinburgh Reviewers</rs> complain of them for being too artificial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>You praise the <rs>Village Pastor</rs>, whose name I have never heard in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>, except when I have inquired about it. The critics of the <rs>North</rs> say the reading of <persName n="Schiller,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01034" reg="mostcommon:Schiller,nomatch:0"><surname>Schiller</surname></persName>'s Robbers makes an epoch in every man's life; from which remark, it is apparent the innocent do not know that, though <persName n="Schiller,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01035" reg="mostcommon:Schiller,nomatch:0"><surname>Schiller</surname></persName>'s countrymen are aware of the strength of character and talent which were necessary to produce in his circumstances, and the circumstances of the country, such a tragedy as the <q direct="unspecified">Robbers</q> at the age of <num value="21">twenty-one</num>, yet that their good sense and good taste have banished it long, long since from the stage, and ceased to read it except as a curious proof of misdirected genius, though it is now domesticated in the <rs>English</rs> theatres.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>Perhaps you will ask what I mean by all this tirade against other people's mistakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>I mean to show you by foreign proof that the <name>German</name> literature is a peculiar national literature, which, like the miraculous creation of <persName n="Deucalion,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01036" reg="mostcommon:Deucalion,nomatch:0"><surname>Deucalion</surname></persName>, has sprung directly from their own soil, and is so intimately connected with their character, that it is very difficult for a stranger to understand it. A Frenchman, or indeed any <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Roman</rs> nations, generally makes as bad work with it as <persName n="Voltaire,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01037" reg="mostcommon:Voltaire,nomatch:0"><surname>Voltaire</surname></persName> with <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01038" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, and for the same reasons; for it deals with a class of feelings and ideas which are entirely without the periphery of his conceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>An Englishman, too, if he studies it at home only, generally succeeds about as well,&mdash;but show me the man who, like <persName n="Scott,,Walter,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01039" reg="default:Scott,Walter,,,"><foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, has studied it as it deserves, or, like <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01040" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,Henry,Nelson,,:1"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, has been in the country, and who has gone home and laughed at it. <persName n="Rose,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0005.00119.01041" reg="mostcommon:Rose,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rose</surname></persName>, in <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName>, told me he would defy all the critics of his nation to produce such an instance.

<p>After all, however, you will come round upon me with the old question, <q direct="unspecified">And what <hi rend="italics">are</hi> your Germans, after all?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>They are a people who, in <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, have created to themselves a literature such as no other nation ever created in <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure>; and they are a people who, at this moment, have more mental activity than any other existing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>I have no disposition to conceal that this literature has many faults; but if you had read <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00120.01042" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,Wolfgang,A.,von,:1"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>'s Tasso, or his Iphigenia, or his ballads, you would never have said their poetry lacks simplicity; or if you had read the tales of <persName n="Musaeus,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00120.01043" reg="mostcommon:Musaeus,nomatch:0"><surname>Musaeus</surname></persName>, or Wieland's Oberon,&mdash;even in Sotheby,&mdash;or <num value="50">fifty</num> other things, you would not have said <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Germans</name> do not know how to tell stories.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>I am not at all disposed to conceal from you that this mental activity is in my opinion very often misdirected and unenlightened,&mdash;but, even when in error, you see that it is the dark gropings of <persName n="Polyphemus,,,,," id="n0230.0005.00120.01044" reg="mostcommon:Polyphemus,nomatch:0"><surname>Polyphemus</surname></persName> round his cave, and that when such ponderous strength comes to the light, it will leave no common monuments of its power and success behind it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>The stranger then, unbuttoning his coat, showed the badge of the police, and presented to me a royal order signed by the minister of police, requiring him to take the justice of the peace of my quarter, to proceed to my lodgings, and to institute a <q direct="unspecified">severe search</q> for <q direct="unspecified">all papers, libels or libellous writings, and books dangerous to the government,</q> &mdash;to seal up all such as might be found of this nature, and carry them to the office of the police.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>I did not hesitate a moment what to do. The commissaries who were standing guard outside were called in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>The search occupied until nearly <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>; and, after reading all my letters, my journal, my copies, etc.,&mdash;or as much of them as was necessary to be sure they were merely domestic and commonplace,&mdash;they finished by drawing up a <hi rend="italics">proces verbal</hi> of <num value="2">two</num> folio pages, saying, as you may well suppose, that they had found nothing, for in truth there was nothing to find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>On parting with the gentlemen, I read them a lecture on the nature of the fruitless outrage they had committed, of the cause of which they were of course as ignorant as myself; and the justice of the peace in return expressed his regrets, and his conviction that I was <q direct="unspecified">not a <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> dangerous person!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> circumstances in the transaction are rather striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>In the first place, that <num value="4">four</num> persons should be sent when it is usual to send but <num value="2">two</num>, as I am told; in the second place, <persName n="Warden,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00142.01254" reg="mostcommon:Warden,D.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Warden</surname></persName> says this is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance he has ever known that an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName> has been subjected to such an insult and outrage as to have a search of any kind made in his quarters; also the form of the order itself was uncommon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>It was a printed paper, the blanks of which were filled by some secretary, and the whole signed by the minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>The minister, however, had gone over and corrected it in his own handwriting; had added <q direct="unspecified">libels or libellous writings</q>; and, instead of the words <q direct="unspecified">perquisition exacte,</q> had substituted <q direct="unspecified">perquisition severe,</q> which was no doubt the reason why the officers proceeded so rigorously.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>The fact is, I have been <hi rend="italics">denounced</hi>, but not in consequence of any letters, and not by any <num value="1">one</num> who knows me well, for my name was spelt wrong in the order, <q direct="unspecified">Bignor</q>; but there is no doubt I was the person intended, as my lodgings and citizenship were rightly designated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>This gives me great comfort; for it must be some vulgar spy, and not my servant or any <num value="1">one</num> whom I see often,&mdash;otherwise I should have been suspicious of everybody who approaches me.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>My affair with the police has come to so singular a conclusion that, after all I have said about it, I cannot choose but finish its history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>Yesterday morning <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00143.01261" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> came to see me rather earlier than it is common to make visits, and, on entering my room, seemed not a little embarrassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>After considerable curious hesitation, he drew from his pocket a paper, gave it to me, and said, with the abrupt haste of a man desirous to get quickly through a business he does not like to begin, <q direct="unspecified">That is the letter, sir, I wrote to the <rs>Duke de Richelieu</rs> on your case.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>I read it. It was a simple statement of the facts, followed by some remarks on the nature of the outrage, much <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> more high-toned than I thought it demanded, or than I supposed a man as cool and calculating as <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01262" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> would have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/><q direct="unspecified">Are those the facts, sir?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>I said they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, sir,</q> he continued, <q direct="unspecified">there is the answer I received half an hour ago.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>On reading it, I found the <rs>Duke de Richelieu</rs> had informed him that his letter had been transmitted immediately to the <rs>Minister</rs> of Police, who had caused search to be made in his office, and in the <orgName>office of the Prefecture</orgName> of the <name>Police</name> for <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, to find the records of the case; that none such had been found; that of course the search in question must have been made by persons unknown to the police; and that if the <rs>American</rs> minister would ascertain who they were, and would transmit their names to the <orgName n="State Office" type="office">Office of State</orgName>, they should be immediately punished as such an unauthorized outrage deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/>I was thunderstruck; not because I imagined a trick had been played upon me, like that performed by the pretended inquisitors on <persName n="Blas,,Gil,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01263" reg="default:Blas,Gil,,,"><foreName>Gil</foreName> <surname>Blas</surname></persName>, but because my word was now at stake against that of the <rs>Minister</rs> of Police, and at the same time I did not know how I could prove my statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/><persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01264" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> asked me if I still supposed the persons to be officers of the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>I told him I did not doubt it in the least, for that they had done their business like men who were accustomed to do it every day. <q direct="unspecified">Do you know the names of any of them?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/><q direct="unspecified">No,</q> I answered; but I did not doubt that <num value="1">one</num> was the police-officer of my quarter, and described him as a man of <num value="50">fifty</num> or upwards, fat, gray-headed, and bald; so that, on finding such a person, <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01265" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> might be sure there was no deception or mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>For, though I do not think he doubted my veracity, yet his situation was so embarrassing, after a flat denial of his statement, that he really did not know what to believe or to do. I told him I would, if possible, find the commissary, and he proposed to go with me to his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>He was not at home, but his wife said he should come to <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01266" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName>'s at <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, and I agreed to meet him there, and verify him. The <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> that intervened, you may be sure, I passed rather uncomfortably; for, if this were not the man, I knew not where to go for confirmation, and must stand convicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Before <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> I was at <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01267" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName>'s hotel, but I was too late; the man had been there at <num value="3">three</num>. <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01268" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> recognized him at once from my description, and said boldly, <q direct="unspecified">I understand you are the person who made a search, some time since, of <persName n="Ticknor,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00144.01269" reg="nearbymention:Ticknor,Elisha,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ticknor</surname></persName>'s papers, etc., in the <rs type="place">Rue Taranne</rs>, <num value="10">No. 10</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>After reflecting a moment, the man said <q direct="unspecified">Yes,</q> he had done it; saying, at the same time, <q direct="unspecified">that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> did not know the causes of it; that he hoped I did not complain of the manner in which it was done, etc.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>On reading it, <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00145.01270" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> said, he was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> very much alarmed at finding he had confessed something he should not have told, and then very angry that his conduct was thus disavowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/><q direct="unspecified">But,</q> said <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00145.01271" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">can there be no mistake?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/><q direct="unspecified">Certainly not,</q> said the officer; <q direct="unspecified">for the order was directed to an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>, living in the <rs type="place">Rue Taranne</rs>, <num value="10">No. 10</num>; and, though there was a mistake in the name, it was only a mistake in spelling it, and I mentioned this circumstance expressly in my <hi rend="italics">proces verbal</hi>, which <persName n="Ticknor,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00145.01272" reg="nearbymention:Ticknor,Elisha,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ticknor</surname></persName> also signed himself, and therefore they know it all, as well as you and I do, and I can prove it, and exculpate myself, unless they have destroyed my <hi rend="italics">proc's verbal</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>He ended by saying that he hoped I should not push the affair any further, which certainly would be best for him, though I doubt not he acted with perfect prudence under his instructions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>There, then, the matter rests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>I told <persName n="Gallatin,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0006.00145.01273" reg="mostcommon:Gallatin,Albert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gallatin</surname></persName> that I felt no further interest in it, and he replied that nothing could now be done, but to write to the <rs>Minister</rs>, and give him the name of the commissary, which he felt so reluctant to do that perhaps he should not do it at all. I acquiesced the more gladly, as this was precisely the man who had behaved most civilly; and thus, I presume, the affair ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>If it were carried further, the reply, no doubt, would be, that it was a mistake arising from similarity of names, which would be as true as that the examination of my papers was unauthorized.</p></body></text> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>I used to get up early and occupy myself with my books in my chamber until <time value="12pm">noon</time>; then I came down, and the <rs>French</rs> lady I mention gave me a regular lesson in reading <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0230.0006.00148.01293" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, which, among her other accomplishments, she had learned to read and declaim with uncommon elegance and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>. . . . If you wish to have my opinion of the <rs>French</rs> theatre, I am perfectly ready to say that it affords an entertainment such as I have never known elsewhere, and for the most natural of all reasons,&mdash; because it is more cultivated and more important here; because it enters much more deeply and intimately into the system of life, and instead of being an accidental amusement, it is an every-day want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>I do not speak now of their tragedy, which wants force and passion, and pleases me little; it has all the beauties of an inimitable diction, but as to the ordinary pretence of the <rs>French</rs> men of letters that it is the continuation and perfection of the <name>Greek</name>, I think it entirely false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>How, for instance, can they compare a theatre, of which a story is related like that of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> representation of the <name>Eumenides</name> of <persName n="Aeschylus,,,,," id="n0230.0006.00149.01307" reg="mostcommon:Aeschylus,nomatch:0"><surname>Aeschylus</surname></persName>, with a theatre of proprieties and conventions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>A Greek was not more unlike a Frenchman than the theatres of the <num value="2">two</num> nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>But in respect to the comedy, I cannot avoid agreeing with the <rs>French</rs> critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>In fact, it seems to me to make a genus in the drama by itself, and it is a great injustice to it to call it by the same name that is worn by other genera in other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/><q direct="unspecified">The Misanthrope,</q> for instance, or <q direct="unspecified">Tartuffe,</q> have but little in common with the <rs>English</rs> comedy, except inasmuch as <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0230.0006.00149.01308" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> and a few others have imitated the <rs>French</rs>; and still less can the intriguing comedy of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, or the vulgar buffoonery of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, pretend to a relationship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>This excellency of the <rs>French</rs> comedy is, too, very natural and <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> probable <hi rend="italics">&agrave; priori</hi>. Their national character furnishes more material for it than can be found anywhere else; the forms of society and the tone of their conversation partake just enough of the nature of a representation to fit them admirably for the stage, and their light and flexible and equivocal language lends itself to express comical shades and inflections, of which all others are incapable, while at the same time the foppery and gallantry of their actors, and the levity and the coquetry of their actresses, are so natural and piquant, because they, like the nation they belong to, are playing the same parts all day in common life that they represent to the public in the evening.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>Do not misunderstand me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>On my arrival here, on the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="23">23d ultimo</day></dateStruct>, my dear father and mother, I immediately wrote to tell you of my safety . . . . . And now I can tell you that I am as comfortably settled as I have been anywhere <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, with as good prospects of accomplishing the objects for which I came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>But you like to have details, and I like to give them to you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>In the first place, I am settled in lodgings procured for me by <persName n="Erving,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0009.00187.01560" reg="mostcommon:Erving,George,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Erving</surname></persName>, with people he knows to be honest, and whom I find uncommonly neat; which, you will observe, are the <num value="2">two</num> rarest virtues in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>In the next place, I rise early,&mdash;at <time value="5:30">half past 5</time>,&mdash;and sit down to my books, taking a cup of <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> chocolate, so thick it may almost be eaten with a fork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>I work from this time until <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>. At this hour my Spanish instructor comes, and remains with me till <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>He is a very good master,&mdash;as good as there is in <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, I suppose,&mdash;punctual, patient, and accurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>About half an hour after he is gone&mdash;during which I make my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> breakfast, according to the fashions of the <name>Continent</name>&ndash;comes my other instructor; for, as I have nothing to do here but to learn Spanish, I think it best to multiply the means . . . .This, however, is an entirely different man from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>His name is <persName n="Conde,,Joseph,Antonio,," id="n0230.0009.00187.01561" reg="default:Conde,Joseph,Antonio,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>Antonio</foreName> <surname>Conde</surname></persName>; and among all the men of letters I have met in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>,&mdash;and I believe I have seen the most considerable in my department,&mdash;he has the most learning by far, and the most taste and talent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>He was formerly librarian to the king; when the <rs>French</rs> came he fled; but, on assurances of personal safety, returned from <placeName key="tgn,7008441" n="1.000 10" reg="Toulouse,Haute-Garonne,Midi-Pyrenees,France,Europe">Toulouse</placeName>, where he had taken refuge, and was soon afterwards placed at the head of that department of the <name>Ministry</name> of the <name>Interior</name> which was devoted to public instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>On the restoration of the <name>Bourbons</name> he was of course displaced; but still his merits and his honesty were so notorious that he was excepted (and I believe alone) from the sweeping prosecution of all who had served under <persName><foreName>Joseph</foreName></persName>, and permitted to live unmolested in <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, where he is much respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>He is about <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> old, extremely ignorant of the world, timid in disposition, awkward in manners, and of childlike simplicity and openness in his feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>I had letters to him from <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n0230.0009.00187.01562" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, and&mdash;not because he is poor, for he is not, but because he is solitary from the death of his wife, and unoccupied from the loss of his employments&mdash;he comes and reads Spanish poetry with me <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> every day. The pleasure he takes in it is evidently great; for he has no less enthusiasm than learning, and nothing gives him so much delight as to see that I share his feelings for his favorite authors, which I truly do; while, on the other hand, the information I get from him is such as I could get, probably, from nobody else, and certainly in no other way. <pb id="p.188" n="188"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>When I dine at home, it is at <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time>; when I dine abroad, it is at <num value="4">four</num>, for that is the hour at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>; I prefer the latest possible, because it makes my studying day longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>After dinner I walk until <time value="8:30">half past 8</time> or <num value="9">nine</num>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>I therefore dine abroad nearly all the time; but as soon as I can speak Spanish tolerably I shall seek Spanish society, which is almost completely distinct from the diplomatic, and is to be found only in late evening parties, called <hi rend="italics">tertulias</hi>, which all the principal people have every night, and to which <persName n="Erving,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0009.00188.01565" reg="mostcommon:Erving,George,W.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Erving</surname></persName> can introduce me better than anybody else. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>There is more national character here, more originality and poetry in the popular manners and feelings, more force without barbarism, and civilization without corruption, than I have found anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>Would you believe it?&mdash;I speak not at all of the highest class,&mdash;what seems mere fiction and romance in other countries is matter of observation here, and, in all that relates to manners, <persName n="Cervantes,,,,," id="n0230.0009.00188.01568" reg="mostcommon:Cervantes,nomatch:0"><surname>Cervantes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sage,,Le,,," id="n0230.0009.00188.01569" reg="default:Sage,Le,,,"><foreName>Le</foreName> <surname>Sage</surname></persName> are historians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>I never come home in the evening that I do not pass half a dozen groups of the lower class of the people dancing to their pipes and castanets some of their beautifully original national dances; for you must observe that, if the <name>Italians</name> are the most musical people in the world, the <name>Spaniards</name> are the most remarkable for a natural and inherent propensity to dance, and have the most <pb id="p.189" n="189"/> graceful movements and manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>Sometimes, especially if it be late, I find a lover with his guitar before the house of his mistress, singing his passion and his suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>Since I have been in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> I have not been so intimate with any <num value="1">one</num> as with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>He has strong literary propensities and not a little literary knowledge, and especially with a genuine goodness of heart, which makes it necessary for him to make those about him happy merely that he may see them so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>Immediately on the return of the king he was appointed ambassador here; not only from the great importance of the post arising from the connection then to be formed anew between the <num value="2">two</num> branches of the restored family, but from the great dignity of the appointment, as the chief embassy <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 8" reg="france">France</placeName> sends, since it is from a Bourbon to a Bourbon, and from the great personal influence he has with the king and court.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>The interior of the city of <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, taken as a whole, is far from handsome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>It should not, however, be forgotten that no city in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> can boast within its walls so fine a walk as the <name>Prado</name>; that <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> alone, as far as I know, has an entrance equal to that by the gate of <persName n="Alcala,,,,," id="n0230.0009.00190.01578" reg="mostcommon:Alcala,Calle,,,:1"><surname>Alcala</surname></persName>; that several of its streets are really fine; that good buildings are not wanting, especially those constructed during the reign of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>., such as the <name>Aduana</name>, built in <dateStruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></dateStruct>, the <name>Academia</name> de <placeName key="possibilities=16" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Fernando</placeName> near it, and the <rs>Casa de Correos</rs>,&mdash;not forgetting the famous convent of Las Salosas, the work of <persName><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName> <genName n="6">VI</genName></persName>.; but then, on the other hand, it may be fairly remembered there is not a fine square in the whole city, or a fine church; that the palace is a confused, irregular, clumsy piece of architecture, begun in <dateStruct value="1737--"><year reg="1737">1737</year></dateStruct>, and never to be finished; and that the new museum, and everything, in short, now doing in the <name>Retiro</name> and elsewhere, is worse than all that has been done before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>Among all that <persName n="Madrid,,,,," id="n0230.0009.00190.01579" reg="mostcommon:Madrid,nomatch:0"><surname>Madrid</surname></persName> boasts in this way, there was nothing that interested me so much as a few obscure buildings, famous for the names and history attached to them, <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> &mdash;the remains of the house where <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName> lived, that where <persName><foreName>Francis</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>was confined, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the famous palaces faithfully described in Gil Bias, the convent which <persName n="Lewis,,,,," id="n0230.0009.00191.01580" reg="mostcommon:Lewis,M.,G.,,:3"><surname>Lewis</surname></persName> has made the scene of his monk, etc., etc., all of which might very likely interest few persons besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>On the whole, both for the past and the present,&mdash;both as a collection of buildings and as a collection of monuments,&mdash;Madrid is the least interesting capital I have visited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2284"/>It has, however, the great merit of being clean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2285"/>I do not know whether I should attribute this altogether to the character of the people, for they are not very neat, and it is apparent the keen fresh air, which reigns of course at this height, dries up all decaying bodies immediately, and prevents the accumulation of filth; so that, though certainly dead animals are not uncommon in the streets, they give little or no disagreeable odor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2286"/>Still, <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> is not healthy. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2287"/>Of the government there is very little good to say. The king personally is a vulgar blackguard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2288"/>I will not repeat the instances of rudeness, vulgarity, and insolence towards his servants and ministers, which are just as well known at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> as that he drives in the <name>Prado</name>, for they would take up my room and time to no purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2289"/>This, then, is the centre of the government; and of what a government!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2290"/>Certainly such a confusion of abuses never existed before since society was organized, and never, I should hope, can exist again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2291"/>In the first place, its very principle&mdash;I mean in practice&mdash;is that the king's decree, which in theory is the highest power in the land, may be resisted and disobeyed, and that the only remedy is to make more decrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2292"/>The ministers desire to procure a certain amount of money, and issue a decree for it; that on the face and in any other country ought to produce it, but here it will not produce the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of it. The ministers desire to procure a certain degree of obedience, and the king decrees it; but the obedience may or may not follow, as in a case I knew at <placeName key="tgn,7007426" n="1.000 3" reg="barcelona,barcelona,cataluna,espana,europe">Barcelona</placeName>, where an oppressed individual demanded simply a hearing of his case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2293"/>The king ordered it by a formal decree to be had forthwith, but the tribunal neglected it; he made a new decree, and so on to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> and <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, each more peremptory than the preceding, and each followed by a similar gross disobedience, until at last the tribunal, wearied out with being thus teazed, quashed the process they were ordered to examine, and told the injured individual to go about his business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/><persName n="Garay,,,,," id="n0230.0009.00191.01581" reg="mostcommon:Garay,Don,M.,de,:1"><surname>Garay</surname></persName>, the <rs>Minister</rs> of Finance, when he came into office announced his system, and it was supported by all sorts of decrees,&mdash;decrees to give a new principle of excise, decrees to remove the custom-house officers to the <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> frontiers of the kingdom, etc., etc.; and all are still nominally in force and actually disobeyed, as I have myself witnessed again and again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2295"/>The remedy in these cases is to make more decrees, that, from the aggregate of all, obedience enough may be produced to keep the government in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2296"/>There is thus a kind of tacit compromise between the government and its agents, that the king shall issue decrees, and that the people shall be tolerated in disobedience; and in this way disturbances are of course avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2297"/>If, however, on the contrary, the king should attempt to execute even <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the decrees that are nominally in force, he would, I am persuaded, raise a rebellion in a fortnight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2298"/>This system, of course, supposes a certain degree of independence in the officers of government, since it gives them in fact the power of resistance; and this independence leads to such a train of abuses and corruptions as nobody can imagine who has not been in the country, and week after week had them continually pounded into his ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2299"/>There is nothing that cannot be done by bribery; and&mdash;what is the most extraordinary phenomenon I suspect in legislation&mdash;Garay, who as minister did not of course like to see the money that should come to the <name>Treasury</name> stop in the hands of its agents, has by his decree of <dateStruct value="1818-08-05"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="5">5</day>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, instead of seeking to find a remedy for all these gross abuses, coolly legalized them, and what before were bribes he now calls taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>Thus, if you want to have a cause examined in the highest tribunal, instead of feeing the servants all round, you pay <measure n="750dollars" type="currency">$750</measure> to the <name>Treasury</name>, and the tribunal <hi rend="italics">must</hi> hear you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>The chief persons in a village &mdash; I mean the respectable ecclesiastics and the alcaldes <pb id="p.198" n="198"/> &mdash;often have no <rs n="glass ware" type="product">glass-ware</rs> in their houses, no <rs n="dinner knives" type="product">dinner-knives</rs>, and little of earthen manufactory, while a metal fork is a matter of curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>In agriculture their instruments are extremely clumsy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>The scythes, hoes, shovels, pickaxes, etc., are so awkward, that I do not well see how they work with them; their threshing I have seen done, at the gates of <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, on just such a threshing-floor as is described in the Old Testament, and by the identical process of driving horses over the grain; their plough, which is of a construction singularly clumsy and inefficient, is the same the <name>Romans</name> used when they were here, for I have it on a coin of <persName n="Augustus,,Caesar,,," id="n0230.0009.00198.01612" reg="default:Augustus,Caesar,,,"><foreName>Caesar</foreName> <surname>Augustus</surname></persName>; and their mode of drawing water by a horse or mule, and a wheel, is the very <num value="1">one</num> which, for its antiquity, is in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> attributed to <persName><foreName>Joseph</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2375"/>The means and conveniences of life are, then, few here, and the comforts may, as a general remark, be said to be unknown in all that relates to the mechanical arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2376"/>Their amusements, too, are hardly less meagre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2377"/>The common people, however, it should be observed, are gay and light-hearted in their natural dispositions, and on the festivals, which are above <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the whole year, are always seen in the <name>Delicias</name>,&mdash;a public walk outside the walls,&mdash;on the borders of the canal, and in the meadows of the <name>Manzanares</name>, dancing to their guitars and castanets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2378"/>Every evening, too, as I come home I find little groups of them dancing the <hi rend="italics">bolero</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">fandango</hi>, and the <hi rend="italics">manchegas</hi> in the streets; for, if the <name>Italians</name> are the most musical people in the world, the <name>Spaniards</name> of all classes, and especially the lowest, are the most fond of dancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2379"/>Their very movements seem from nature to be graceful, and their resting positions picturesque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>Except this, however, and the universal passion for <hi rend="italics">toros</hi>, they have little amusement that is social, except in a kind of tavern, where they go during the evenings of the summer, not to drink strong liquors,&mdash; for I never saw a Spaniard intoxicated,&mdash;but to refresh themselves with iced water, orgeats, and <hi rend="italics">cebada</hi>, which, as they are the necessaries of life in this burning climate, seem to be within the reach of everybody's means.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2381"/>The middling classes are the most reserved and the least gay of all the population of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>,&mdash;the most difficult of access, and the <pb id="p.199" n="199"/> least interesting to a stranger when they are known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>Their amusements are few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2386"/>to me, the <name>Prado</name> is an inexhaustible source of amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2387"/>In the first place, it is in itself the finest public walk I have ever seen within the walls of any city, not excepting either the <name>Tuileries</name> or the <name>Chiaja</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2388"/>It begins at the gate of Atocha, and, passing the superb entrance of <persName n="Alcala,,,,," id="n0230.0010.00200.01613" reg="nearbymention:Alcala,Calle,,,de"><surname>Alcala</surname></persName>, extends round to the convent and gate of the <name>Recoletos</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>Anciently it was an uneven meadow of little beauty, but famous for being the scene of the plots, murders, duels, and intrigues of the city and court, as may easily be gathered from the familiar use made of it in the novels of <persName n="Cervantes,,,,," id="n0230.0010.00200.01614" reg="mostcommon:Cervantes,nomatch:0"><surname>Cervantes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sage,,Le,,," id="n0230.0010.00200.01615" reg="default:Sage,Le,,,"><foreName>Le</foreName> <surname>Sage</surname></persName>, the plays of <persName><foreName>Lope</foreName></persName>, and indeed the old comedies and romances generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>It was not, however, until the middle of the last century, when the neighboring palace of Buen Retiro rose into favor, that <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>levelled it, planted it with trees, and made it the beautiful walk it now is. As you enter it from the gate of <persName n="Alcala,,,,," id="n0230.0010.00200.01616" reg="nearbymention:Alcala,Calle,,,de"><surname>Alcala</surname></persName>, or rather from the street next to it, you find yourself in a superb, wide opening called the <name>Saloon</name>; on your right hand a double walk, and on your left, first the place where the carriages parade, and afterwards another double walk, the whole ornamented with <num value="3">three</num> fine fountains, and <num value="8">eight</num> rows of trees, statues, marble seats, etc. During the forenoon, and nearly all the afternoon, no part of the city in summer is so silent and deserted as this; and yet, when the heats will permit, it is a spot which of all others here most solicits you by its freshness, its solitude, and its shade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2392"/>At <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> the whole <rs>Prado</rs> is watered, to prevent the dust which would otherwise be intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>Just before sundown the carriages and crowd begin to appear; and about half an hour after the exhibition is in its greatest splendor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>On your left hand are <num value="2">two</num> rows of carriages, forming a complete line, slowly moving up and down on each side, while the king and the <hi rend="italics">infantas</hi> dash up and down in the middle <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> with all the privileges of royalty, and compel everybody on foot to take off his hat as he passes, and everybody in a carriage to stop and stand up. . . . . Every time I see this singularly picturesque crowd, mingled with the great number of the officers of the guard that are always there in splendid uniforms, and contrasted with the still greater number of monks and priests in their dark, severe costumes, I feel persuaded anew that it is the most striking moving panorama the world can afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>At about <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour after sunset, when the <name>Prado</name> is usually quite full, the <name>Angelus</name>, or evening-prayer [bell], sounds in the neighboring convent, and the row of carriages stops as if by magic, while everybody on foot becomes fixed as a statue and prays. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>As to theatres, <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> has but <num value="2">two</num>, and these have always been in a struggle for their existence, and even now can hardly be said to have gained a decided victory over the monks, and the <name>Inquisition</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>The <rs>Principe</rs> is in general the best, since Mayquez, who is an <hi rend="italics">eleve</hi> of Talma, and not a bad imitation of his master, though little else, acts there; but the <name>Cruz</name> is more interesting to me, because more of the original national pieces, written before the <rs>French</rs> dynasty came in, are represented there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>I have been often to both as a means of learning the language, especially if any of the old plays were represented, and really all that is national in it delights me more and more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>The ancient Spanish costumes, which are strictly observed, are so splendid and graceful, the ancient manners, which are no less imitated and observed, have something so original and noble, and the plays themselves are written in a style of poetry so proud and elevated, though often with bad taste, that when the play is by <persName><foreName>Lope</foreName></persName>, or <persName n="Molina,,Tirso,,,de" id="n0230.0010.00201.01617" reg="expanded:Molina,Tirso,,,"><foreName>Tirso</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Molina</surname></persName>, or Montalban, or <persName n="Calderon,,,,," id="n0230.0010.00201.01618" reg="mostcommon:Calderon,nomatch:0"><surname>Calderon</surname></persName>, I think I had rather go to the <rs>Spanish</rs> theatre than to any other except the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>After the principal piece, some of their beautifully graceful national dances, the <hi rend="italics">bolero</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">polo</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">fandango</hi>, or the <hi rend="italics">manchegas</hi>, are performed with castanets, and the whole ends with what is called a <hi rend="italics">saynete</hi>, a little piece less farcical than our afterpieces, which is to a regular play what an anecdote is to a novel, and represents to the life the manners of the lower or middling classes, which the <rs>Spanish</rs> actors play with more spirit and less caricature than those of any other nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>The great sin of both theatres is, that the majority of the longer pieces they represent are translations from ordinary <name>French</name> comedies, though it must be confessed they are becoming better in this respect; and that the national plays are coming more into fashion, and are oftener acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>The great amusement&mdash;the national and prevailing amusement, which swallows up all the rest&mdash;is the <hi rend="italics">fiestas de toros</hi>, the bull-fights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>It is purely and exclusively Spanish, and the passion with which it is sought by all classes, and with which it always seems to have been sought, is inconceivable to <num value="1">one</num> who has not witnessed it; and would be incredible upon common testimony, if we had not the histories of the gladiators and <hi rend="italics">circenses</hi>, for examples before us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2408"/>There it is said, incidentally, that there were bull-fights in <placeName key="tgn,1129442" n="1.000 10" reg="Salda,Sverdlovskaya Oblast',Rossiya,Rossiya,Asia">Salda</placeName>&ntilde;a, in <dateStruct value="1124--"><year reg="1124">1124</year></dateStruct>, on the marriage of <persName><foreName>Alfonso</foreName> <genName n="7">VII</genName></persName>.; and there is an ancient tradition, which I think I have noticed in his Chronicle, that the <name>Cid</name> was a famous <hi rend="italics">toreador</hi>, and that he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that ever fought bulls on horseback.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2416"/>The whole city throngs to the circus, even to the very lowest class of the populace; and I have often seen more waiting on the outside-merely to hear, and echo and enjoy, the shouts and stories that come from within, because they could not afford to pay the price of admittance&mdash;than the entire amphitheatre could contain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2417"/>For myself, I cannot speak with any of the skill or assurance of a connoisseur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2441"/>They are the hardiest and most enterprising of all the <name>Spaniards</name>, and, at the season of the harvest, may be found all over <placeName key="tgn,2068373" n="1.000 1" reg="castile, wyoming, new york">Castile</placeName> and Estramadura, and even in <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 4" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName>, gathering it for the idle inhabitants; some remain afterwards as servants, and some are to be found in little shops and inns everywhere in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>; but when they have accumulated a subsistence, they are almost sure to go home to die in peace at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2442"/>These different characters are so distinctly marked in the different provinces, that it seems as if you had changed country every time you pass from <num value="1">one</num> to another; but still there are some traits in common to them all. <num value="1">One</num> of the most striking&mdash;and <num value="1">one</num>, it seems to me, on which many of their national virtues are founded&mdash;is a kind of instinctive uprightness, which prevents them from servility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>on the <dateStruct value="-10-8"><day reg="8">8th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> I embarked in the steamboat that plies on the river as far as <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName>; and, after rather a pleasant and favorable passage,. . . . arrived in the evening at the ancient capital of Andalusia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>It is admirably situated on the banks of the <name>Guadalquivir</name>, in the midst of an extensive and fertile plain, and is surrounded with the ancient Moorish wall, that was so terribly defended against St. Ferdinand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>Under the <name>Arabs</name>, it was <num value="1">one</num> of the largest and richest cities in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>; and, on its surrender, nearly <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> <persName n="Moors,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00237.01753" reg="mostcommon:Moors,nomatch:0"><surname>Moors</surname></persName>, it is said, emigrated to <placeName key="tgn,7002821" n="1.000 3" reg="granada">Granada</placeName>, and yet did not depopulate it; so that, in <dateStruct value="1426--"><year reg="1426">1426</year></dateStruct>, it had again above <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> souls within its walls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>The circumstance that the <rs>American</rs> fleets came here, increased its wealth prodigiously, between the end of the <num value="15" type="ordinal">fifteenth</num> century and the year <dateStruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></dateStruct>, as its churches and convents sufficiently prove; but the expulsion of the <name>Moors</name> by <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>gave it a severe shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>The fall of the manufactures, on which its population depended, and which fell from the introduction of other modes of dress,&mdash;as those of <persName n="Lyons,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00237.01754" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyons</surname></persName> afterwards did,&mdash;hastened its decay; and finally, the exclusive monopoly given to <placeName reg="Cadiz, Cadiz, Andalucia" key="tgn,7007512">Cadiz</placeName>, and the gradual filling up of its river,&mdash;which is now no longer navigable for large vessels, though it might again be made so,&mdash;completed its ruin, and it lies lifeless and inactive,&mdash;<hi rend="italics">jacet ingens litore truncus</hi>,&mdash;with a population of hardly <num value="90000">ninety thousand</num> souls.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>Amidst all this decay, however, <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the interesting cities of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and for the arts and letters perhaps the most so; for the splendid epoch of the <name>Moors</name>, the residence of the early Castilian kings, and the wealth of the newly discovered Americas, have left behind them monuments of no common note; while, at the same time, the circumstance that there are curious <name>Roman</name> ruins in the neighborhood, and that in the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> century it was the capital seat of the genuine <pb id="p.238" n="238"/> Spanish school in painting, increase its claims and its interest until, I am hardly disposed to doubt, they are unrivalled in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>To begin, then, with the oldest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>You pass out of <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName> by the <rs>Faubourg Triana</rs>,&mdash;which is a corruption of Traiana,&mdash;and, after stopping an instant at the fine Convent of <placeName key="tgn,1136460;tgn,1024740;tgn,1020001;tgn,2107470;tgn,2067522;tgn,1136359" n="0.003 000000.2530	placename;tgn,1136460;San Isidro,Buenos Aires,Argentina,South America,Buenos Aires,Argentina,South America;0.003 000000.2530	placename;tgn,1024740;San Isidro,Lima,Peru,South America,Lima,Peru,South America;0.003 000000.2530	placename;tgn,1020001;San Isidro,Catamarca,Argentina,South America,Catamarca,Argentina,South America;0.001 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2107470;San Isidro, Starr, Texas,Starr,Texas,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.1240	placename;tgn,2067522;San Ysidro, Sandoval, New Mexico,Sandoval,New Mexico,United States,North and Central America;0.001 000000.1240	placename;tgn,1136359;San Isidro,Chihuahua,Mexico,North and Central America,Chihuahua,Mexico,North and Central America" reg="San Isidro,Buenos Aires,Argentina,South America,Buenos Aires,Argentina,South America;San Isidro,Lima,Peru,South America,Lima,Peru,South America;San Isidro,Catamarca,Argentina,South America,Catamarca,Argentina,South America;San Isidro, Starr, Texas,Starr,Texas,United States,North and Central America;San Ysidro, Sandoval, New Mexico,Sandoval,New Mexico,United States,North and Central America;San Isidro,Chihuahua,Mexico,North and Central America,Chihuahua,Mexico,North and Central America">San Isidro</placeName> del Campo to see the tomb of that <persName><foreName>Alfonso</foreName></persName> <persName n="Guzman,,Perez,,,de" id="n0230.0012.00238.01755" reg="expanded:Guzman,Perez,,,"><foreName>Perez</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Guzman</surname></persName> who gave a new escutcheon to the family of Medina Sidonia by the sacrifice of his son at the siege of Tarifa, you find on the right bank of the <name>Guadalquivir</name>, a league from the city, the extensive ruins of Italica.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>It was certainly the native place of <persName><foreName>Trajan</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Italicus,,Silius,,," id="n0230.0012.00238.01756" reg="default:Italicus,Silius,,,"><foreName>Silius</foreName> <surname>Italicus</surname></persName>, and may have given birth to <persName><foreName>Hadrian</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Theodosius,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00238.01757" reg="mostcommon:Theodosius,nomatch:0"><surname>Theodosius</surname></persName>, for it seems hardly probable that the favor of <num value="1">one</num> emperor could have spread out so large a city as the ruins here indicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>The most interesting remains are of the walls, baths, etc., and especially of an amphitheatre and some mosaics, of which <persName n="La Borde,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00238.01758" reg="mostcommon:La Borde,nomatch:0"><surname>La Borde</surname></persName> has given a detailed and interesting description, with a history of the city down to its final fall in the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> century, in a folio volume published some years since at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>Everything, however, is neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>The amphitheatre even is falling in every year; the mosaics, as I absolutely saw, are a part of a sheepfold, and, of course, more and more broken up every day; and the only person, I believe, who takes any interest in these curious remains, is a poor advocate of <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName>, who comes out here on the feast days, and digs among them with his own hands, though what he has found and what I saw in the <name>Alcazar</name> might well excite to more important excavations, if there were either taste or curiosity in the government to be excited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>Next comes the <name>Alcazar</name>, formerly the palace of the <rs>Moorish</rs> kings, where I passed a great many pleasant hours, and dined daily, with its kind, open-hearted, chivalrous governor, <persName n="Downie,Sir,John,,," id="n0230.0012.00238.01759" reg="default:Downie,John,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Downie</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>In modern times it has been much altered and enlarged; but still there are a great many apartments, particularly the bathing-rooms and the hall of the ambassadors, that are Arabic, as is its general air, and its gardens of all flowers and fragrance, so that, notwithstanding its changes, it yet remains <num value="1">one</num> of the very curious monuments of Arabian architecture. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>[The <rs type="place">Cathedral</rs>] is <measure n="398feet" type="distance">three hundred and ninety-eight feet</measure> long and <measure n="291feet" type="distance">two hundred and ninety-one feet</measure> wide, and altogether <num value="1">one</num> of the most pure, solemn, and imposing specimens of the genuine, uncorrupted, unmixed Gothic style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>Annexed to the <rs type="place">Cathedral</rs>, and belonging to it, is a library that must interest an American at least, since it was founded by <persName n="Colon,,Hernando,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01761" reg="default:Colon,Hernando,,,"><foreName>Hernando</foreName> <surname>Colon</surname></persName>, a natural son of the discoverer of our country. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/><placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName>, however, should also be considered as the capital seat of the genuine Spanish school in painting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>It is to the <rs type="place">Italian school</rs> what the <name>Sylvanus</name> and the <rs>Borghese Gladiator</rs> are to the <name>Apollo</name> and the <name>Niobe</name>; the perfection of human beauty, but nothing ideal, nothing taken from that hidden source of more than mortal grace and harmony, where <persName><foreName>Raphael</foreName></persName> stole the ideas for his Galatea, his <persName n="Psyche,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01762" reg="mostcommon:Psyche,nomatch:0"><surname>Psyche</surname></persName>, and his Madonnas, as <persName n="Prometheus,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01763" reg="mostcommon:Prometheus,nomatch:0"><surname>Prometheus</surname></persName> stole the fire of heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>This is certainly wanting; yet, perhaps, no man ever stood before the works of <persName n="Murillo,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01764" reg="mostcommon:Murillo,nomatch:0"><surname>Murillo</surname></persName> here,&mdash;his Feeding the <num value="5000"><persName n="Thousand,,Five,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01765" reg="default:Thousand,Five,,,"><foreName>Five</foreName> <surname>Thousand</surname></persName></num>, and his <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01766" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> opening the <rs type="place">Rock</rs>, in the <name>Caridad</name>, or his Assumption, in the <name>Capuchinos</name>,&mdash; and yet could be guilty of breathing a single regret at the recollections of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 5" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>. . . . . The wonderful genius of <persName n="Murillo,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01767" reg="mostcommon:Murillo,nomatch:0"><surname>Murillo</surname></persName> can be studied and felt nowhere but at <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName>, where he lived and died, and whose Cathedral, convents, and houses are full of his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/><persName n="Velasquez,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01768" reg="mostcommon:Velasquez,nomatch:0"><surname>Velasquez</surname></persName>, too, was a Sevilian; but he lived and labored at <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>, and must be sought there in the <name>Palace</name>, and in the <name>Academy</name> of <placeName key="possibilities=16" n="1.000 10" reg=",">San Fernando</placeName>; but except him, I believe there is no Spanish painter of high merit, that cannot be better understood at <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName> than anywhere else, especially <persName n="Herrera,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01769" reg="mostcommon:Herrera,nomatch:0"><surname>Herrera</surname></persName> and Ca&ntilde;o, who, with <persName n="Velasquez,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01770" reg="mostcommon:Velasquez,nomatch:0"><surname>Velasquez</surname></persName> and <persName n="Murillo,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00239.01771" reg="mostcommon:Murillo,nomatch:0"><surname>Murillo</surname></persName>, are the great masters of the school.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>Of the people of <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName> I saw a good deal and under different aspects, during the week I was there; that is, a good deal for so short a period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>The lower classes are gay almost to folly, or, at least, were so at that moment, for it was the season of the great annual fair at Santiponce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>To this fair all <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName> goes out, during a week, every day. There are nothing but playthings, showy ornaments, and other trifles sold there; and as they come back into the city, a crowd is stationed at the bridge and for half a mile farther up, that abuses them with Andalusian volubility for their finery, which they gayly hold out and as gayly defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>In short, it is a kind of carnival, and I used to walk out that way for half an hour in the evening, to witness and enjoy this singular and striking exhibition of the light-hearted gayety of the popular character here, which, like the <rs>Roman</rs>, never passes to excess from this kind of excitement, as the character of the <rs>North</rs> does; for in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> or <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName> you could not have such a crowd and such abuse as I heard without quarrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/><pb id="p.240" n="240"/></p> 
<p>I knew in <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName> a good many ecclesiastics,&mdash;Guzman, who once commanded a Spanish frigate and is now a canon of the <rs type="place">Cathedral</rs>, old, and <num value="1">one</num> of the mildest, kindest, and most elegant gentlemen I remember to have met; Pereyra, very rich, with some learning and a great deal of taste, who served me regularly <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure> a day as cicerone, and showed me everything in and about the city; and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> others of less name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>The <rs>Archbishop</rs> was out of town, and I did not think him worth a journey of <num value="3">three</num> leagues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>But the ecclesiastics in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> never will serve for evening society, for in the evening they have their duties, their habits, and their suppers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>In the evening, then, I used to go to the houses of some of the nobility that have tertulias: to Mestre's, who belongs to what is called the <hi rend="italics">sangre azl</hi>,&mdash;the blue blood,&mdash;but who, however his blood may be colored, or whatever may be his pretensions, has a fine collection of pictures and a pleasant family; to the house of the <rs>Conde de Arcos</rs>, a good-natured gentleman, whom I knew in <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName>; and to the little dances at the <rs>Countess de Castillejas</rs>, which made a more rational amusement than I ever met before at a Spanish tertulia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>Every day, too, I dined regularly at the <rs type="place">Moorish castle</rs>, with its chivalrous castellan, <persName n="Downie,Sir,John,,," id="n0230.0012.00240.01772" reg="default:Downie,John,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Downie</surname></persName>, a frank, vehement Scotchman, who has risen to much favor by his conduct during the last war. He came out <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with <persName n="Moore,Sir,John,,," id="n0230.0012.00240.01773" reg="default:Moore,John,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>, and returned with the expedition; then came out again with <persName n="Wellesley,Sir,Arthur,,," id="n0230.0012.00240.01774" reg="default:Wellesley,Arthur,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Arthur</foreName> <surname>Wellesley</surname></persName>, and gained such reputation in <placeName key="tgn,7003837" n="1.000 3" reg="extremadura,espana,europe">Estremadura</placeName>, that a legion of <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> men was collected by the influence of his name, and served under him during the rest of the war with great success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>It was there he received the present of <persName n="Pizarro,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00240.01775" reg="mostcommon:Pizarro,Chev,,,:1"><surname>Pizarro</surname></persName>'s sword, from <persName n="Pizarro,,,,," id="n0230.0012.00240.01776" reg="mostcommon:Pizarro,Chev,,,:1"><surname>Pizarro</surname></persName>'s family, which he showed to me, and which I saw with no common interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>This sword, too, has attached to it a story that well shows the chivalrous character of its present possessor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>He had it at his side in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, when the famous attack was made on <placeName reg="Sevilla, Sevilla, Andalucia" key="tgn,7008676">Seville</placeName>, where he commanded the vanguard formed of his own legion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>At the moment he approached, the <rs>French</rs> began to break up the only bridge by which the city could be reached; and, in order to prevent them, <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName> made a charge at the head of his troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>A chasm had already been made, but, thinking only of his object, he put spurs to his horse and leaped to the enemy's side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>His men, however, who had not horses of such mettle, could not follow, and he remained alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>At this instant, he was struck by a grapeshot, and, while half senseless, was made prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>Still he did not forget his sword, and, gathering the little strength that remained to him, he threw it back over the chasm among his own soldiers, who <pb id="p.241" n="241"/> recognized and saved it. The scabbard, however, being fastened to his side, fell into the hands of the enemy, and they had the meanness to keep it; so that, though the city was taken and he was liberated <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> afterwards, it was never found again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>This and a great many other similar stories he used to relate to me, with Scottish openheartedness, as we sat by his Moorish fountains or walked in the corridor of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="5">V</genName></persName>. after dinner; and these hours I shall remember as among the pleasantest I have passed in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 7" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>The next morning we felt quite acquainted, and, in the course of a journey of <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> through a country little frequented, and where, in fact, we avoided all human habitation, a curious sort of intimacy grew up between me and my kindly, faithful guides, which gave me a view of human nature on a side where I never thought to have seen it. <num value="2">Two</num> of them were evidently men of much natural talent, and from them I gathered a pretty definite account of the principles and feelings of the fraternity and of their political and religious principles, which were strongly marked and well accommodated to their situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>This kind of conversation, indeed, was my chief amusement, for everything else on the journey was dreary and cheerless enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>Roads we sought none, but saw now and then a footpath or a sheeptrack, <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> which we rather avoided, and got on more by the instinctive knowledge of the guides than by any positive indication that anybody had ever gone that way before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2844"/>But of all the works at <placeName reg="Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,7010978">Lisbon</placeName> that deserve to be seen, the most remarkable is certainly the aqueduct that supplies the city, which is, I doubt not, unrivalled either as a conveyance for water or as a specimen of this kind of architecture; for, as antiquity has certainly sent down to us nothing so perfect or so bold, I presume modern times have no competition to offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2845"/>It was the work of <persName><foreName>John</foreName> <genName n="5">V</genName></persName>., and was built between <dateStruct value="1713--"><year reg="1713">1713</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1732--"><year reg="1732">1732</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2847"/>The most remarkable point is where it crosses the vale of <placeName reg="Alcantara, Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa" key="tgn,1003942">Alcantara</placeName>, just before it enters the city; and here it altogether exceeds everything I have seen, even the <rs>Pont du Gard</rs>, which is more remarkable than the aqueducts about <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2849"/>The water passes the whole way completely covered, in a kind of continued building in which you can walk upright, and divided into <num value="2">two</num> channels, in <num value="1">one</num> of which it flows half the year and in the other the other half, so that it may be kept clean and in repair,&mdash;an advantage, I believe, no other aqueduct possesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2850"/>On each side, too, is a walk like a bridge, and the view from it of the valley winding up between the hills, ornamented with the country-seats of the nobility, and covered with orange <pb id="p.245" n="245"/> and lemon and almond trees, is worthy of the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,7010978">Lisbon</placeName>; while, as you look perpendicularly down, your head grows giddy at the awful height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>Or, as you look up from the bottom, and see the majestic arch over you, at such an elevation that its thickness is sensibly diminished to the sight, though it still echoes and re-echoes every sound you utter, you feel that indistinct impression of inferiority and subjection that you do when you stand before <num value="1">one</num> of the great works of nature. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/>But, though I should pass over everything else, I must not pass over Cintra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>To this beautiful spot I went with my friend <persName n="Campbell,Sir,John,,," id="n0230.0012.00245.01782" reg="default:Campbell,John,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, and we passed there <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, at the festival of <placeName reg="San Martinho">San Martinho</placeName>, when all the country was rejoicing in the balmy freshness of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> spring, and all the fields and valleys were filled with flowers, as they are with us in the month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>This singular phenomenon I have been witnessing ever since the rains fell in the end of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>; for since then, the earth has been putting on its gayest hues again, so that now, when the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> spring, as it is here called, may be considered in its perfection, everything, even to the lilies and roses and lilacs, is in blossom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>Cintra, therefore, was exquisitely beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>It is the height <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> descried on approaching this coast, and is called by the sailors the <rs type="place">Rock of Lisbon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>You approach it from the city by a road that offers occasionally a few fine prospects; but you are obliged to turn the angle of the mountain and come round full upon the side that faces the northwest before you can see it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>Cintra, therefore, is a village and a collection of country-seats scattered on the declivity and in the dells of a precipitous mountain, whose sides are covered about <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the way to the summit with the beautiful verdure of rich and various woods, and broken by innumerable little cascades that come rushing down over its rocks; while from its base extends a luxuriant plain, full of culture and population, which, at the distance of between <num value="4">four</num> and <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, is terminated by the ocean, whose magnificence finally closes up the whole prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>The road passes, I should think, about half-way between the summit and the base, and beginning from the southeastern point, where you <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> enter, extends round to beyond the village of <placeName reg="Colares, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,1049751">Colares</placeName>,&mdash;a distance of <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>,&mdash;cut like a kind of cornice in the side of the mountain, whose windings and indentations <pb id="p.246" n="246"/> it follows, so that the prospect shifts and varies at every step you advance; now hiding you in some sunless little dell, where you have only the secrecy of a solitude, covered by the deep shades of its rocky forest, and made, as it were, audible to the feelings by the gushing of some cascade from above, and now carrying you out upon a projecting precipice, from which you have again the wide and glorious prospect of the rock, its broken sides, and the houses and castles that cover them, with all the richness of the plain below and all the grandeur of the ocean beyond.</p>

I remarked, however, that if I spoke, in reply to him, of anything that had happened since to those persons, or of any change in the circumstances that were still so familiar to his thoughts, it made not the slightest impression upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2998"/>I went oftenest at this hour, and generally found <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> friends with her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, as I entered, I saw a single elderly gentleman standing with his back to the fire, dressed in a long gray surtout coat, buttoned quite up to his throat, and marked only with the red ribbon of the <name>Legion</name> of Honor, which ornamented the buttonholes of so many of the persons met in good society, that it constituted no distinction worth notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>He had on a heavy, high, white cravat, concealing a good deal of the lower part of his face, and his hair seemed brought down with powder and pomatum so as to hide his forehead and temples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>In short, hardly anything of his features could be seen that it was easy to cover, and what I saw attracted at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> little of my attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>He stood there kicking the fire-fender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>I observed, however, that he was in earnest conversation with Mad. <persName n="Duras,,de,,," id="n0230.0013.00259.01907" reg="mostcommon:Duras,de,,,:17"><foreName>de</foreName> <surname>Duras</surname></persName>; that she called him <q direct="unspecified">Mon <rs type="role2">Prince</rs></q>; and that the tones of both of them, and especially those of the lady, were a little too eager to be entirely pleasant, though quite well bred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/>I therefore took up a pamphlet and seemed to read; but I listened, as they were talking on a subject of political and legal notoriety, with which society and the journals were then ringing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>But at last it seemed to me that he became a little piqued with some of her sharp sallies, and said, rather suddenly and in a different tone, <q direct="unspecified">But do you know, Mad. <persName n="Duras,,de,,," id="n0230.0013.00259.01910" reg="mostcommon:Duras,de,,,:17"><foreName>de</foreName> <surname>Duras</surname></persName>, who advised</q>&mdash;I think he said <q direct="unspecified">Beugnot</q>&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">to put those words into the <name>Charte</name>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>I answered, without entering into the matter, that of course we had not; but the gentleman in gray&mdash;apparently as glad to change the subject as the lady was&mdash;immediately began to talk about the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and to ask questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>I had not the smallest suspicion who he might be, but I soon perceived that he had been himself in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3018"/>I therefore took the liberty to ask him what parts of the country he had visited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/>Mad. <persName n="Duras,,de,,," id="n0230.0013.00260.01912" reg="mostcommon:Duras,de,,,:17"><foreName>de</foreName> <surname>Duras</surname></persName> here interrupted him by saying, <q direct="unspecified">It was there I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw you, when I was a little girl, my mother and I &eacute;migrees.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>I now became very curious to know who he was, and asked him what other parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> he had visited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>He told me he had been in New York, and that, at <num value="1">one</num> time, he went as far east as <placeName reg="Portland, Cumberland, Maine" key="tgn,7014272">Portland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>I immediately suspected who he was, for I knew that <persName n="Talleyrand,,M.,,,de" id="n0230.0013.00260.01913" reg="expanded:Talleyrand,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Talleyrand</surname></persName> had been so far east, and no farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3026"/>I questioned him, therefore, about <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>He seemed to have some recollection of it; said he knew a very intelligent family there, he did not remember their names, but there was a daughter in it whose name was <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Barbe</foreName></persName></q> [Barbara], <num value="1">one</num> of the handsomest creatures he ever saw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>But he no longer <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> cared anything about her or about anybody in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, except as a part of his own recollections and life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>In this way we continued to talk for some time, until, at last, Mad. <persName n="Duras,,de,,," id="n0230.0013.00261.01917" reg="mostcommon:Duras,de,,,:17"><foreName>de</foreName> <surname>Duras</surname></persName> turned and said, <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Messieurs</foreName></persName>, you talk so much about individuals that I think you ought to know each other,</q> and presented me without further words to <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Talleyrand</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>Everything, of course, now became easy and simple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>I know not well what is the matter with me, but I have a kind of torpor and inefficiency in my faculties, which makes me pass my time here to very little purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>This is by no means from the want of effort, for I do not think I ever made greater exertions in my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>I have been to see nearly, or quite, everybody that would have interested me, if I were in the proper state of mind to be interested.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>In the main point I am likely to succeed well enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>I mean the literature peculiar to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>I have received all the kindness and assistance possible in this, from the <num value="4">four</num> persons in <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName> best qualified to give them, <persName n="Scott,,Walter,,," id="n0230.0014.00275.02062" reg="default:Scott,Walter,,,"><foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jamieson,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0014.00275.02063" reg="mostcommon:Jamieson,Robert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jamieson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Anderson,Doctor,,,," id="n0230.0014.00275.02064" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Thomson,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0014.00275.02065" reg="mostcommon:Thomson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Thomson</surname></persName>. <persName n="Jamieson,Mister,,,," id="n0230.0014.00275.02066" reg="mostcommon:Jamieson,Robert,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jamieson</surname></persName> comes to me every morning, and we have read Scotch poetry together, from the earliest times down to our own day, until it has become as easy to me as <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00275.02067" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>This, indeed, is the great advantage of the society of men of letters in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>: it saves an immense amount of time; for a question, addressed to <num value="1">one</num> who has thoroughly studied a subject you are just beginning to investigate, often produces an answer that is better than a volume, and perhaps serves as a successful explanation to half a dozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>There is a good deal of this society in <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>, certainly, but not so much as I expected to find, or else I am not in a situation to understand or enjoy it. I know, however, all the principal persons who compose it, and meet them frequently, but there seems to be a great difficulty about it, or rather a great defect in it. When a number of persons are met together, as at a dinner, the conversation is rarely general; <num value="1">one</num> person makes a speech, and then another, and finally it stops, nobody knows why, but certainly there is a kind of <hi rend="italics">vis inertioe</hi> in it, which makes its tendency rather to stop than to go on. It is necessary, therefore, to take each person singly, and then, if you insist upon talking with him, it is most probable he will talk very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>The society here is certainly excellent. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>And it is a still greater thing to have this talent come familiarly into the fashion of the times, sustained by that knowledge which must give it a prevalent authority, and at once receive and impart a polish and a tone which give a charm to each alike, and without which neither can become what it ought to be to itself or the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>This, I think, is the secret of the fascination of society at <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>. . . .</p>

For myself, I could not find her so very remarkable, though still I would not appeal from a decision like this, which is like the decision of a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>She had a fine face, certainly, an open, radiant kind of beauty, an exquisite complexion, brilliant black eyes and hair, and a very graceful figure and manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>Her conversation, too, was light and pleasant and unaffected, and, what was most of all to her credit, though she had a perfect consciousness of her own beauty, which she took no pains to conceal, it was mingled with no conceit.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>In the evening he showed me his manuscripts, the longest a kind of poetical history of his life, which, in the course of about <num value="2">two</num> octavo volumes of manuscript, he has brought to his <num value="28" type="ordinal">twenty-eighth</num> year, and of which the <q direct="unspecified">Excursion</q> is a fragment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>It is in blank-verse, and, as far as I read, what has been published is a fair specimen of what remains in manuscript.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>He read me <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Bell,,Peter,,," id="n0230.0014.00287.02189" reg="default:Bell,Peter,,,"><foreName>Peter</foreName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, the <name>Potter</name>,</q> a long tale, with many beauties but much greater defects; and another similar story, <q direct="unspecified">The <rs>Waggoner</rs>.</q>. . . . The whole amused me a good deal; it was a specimen of the lake life, doctrines, and manners, more perfect than I had found at <persName n="Southey,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00287.02190" reg="mostcommon:Southey,Robert,,,:2"><surname>Southey</surname></persName>'s, and, as such, was very curious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/><pb id="p.288" n="288"/> We sat up, therefore, late, and talked a great deal about the living poets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>Of <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00288.02191" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Sophia,,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> he spoke with much respect as a man, and of his works with judicious and sufficient praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>For <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00288.02192" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,Tom,,,"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName> he did not seem to have so much regard; and for <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Byron</foreName></persName> none at all, since,. though he admired his talent, he seemed to have a deep-rooted abhorrence of his character, and besides, I thought, felt a little bitterness against him for having taken something of his own <hi rend="italics">lakish</hi> manner lately, and, what is worse, borrowed some of his thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>On the whole, however, he seemed fairly disposed to do justice to his contemporaries and rivals. . . . . In the morning early I recommenced my journey. . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-03-23"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="23">23</day></dateStruct></hi>.&mdash;At <placeName reg="Birmingham, Birmingham, England" key="tgn,7010955">Birmingham</placeName> I took a post-chaise and went on, and slept at <placeName key="possibilities=16" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Hatton</placeName>,&mdash;old <persName n="Parr,Doctor,,,," id="n0230.0014.00288.02193" reg="mostcommon:Parr,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Parr</surname></persName>'s. This was another pleasant literary visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>The old gentleman received me with kindness, and recognized me at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>I had a letter to him, but it was not necessary, as he remembered me. Since I saw him, age has laid a heavy hand upon him, and he has bent under it. . . . . His mind, however, seems to have remained untouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>He is still as zealous as ever; dogmatizes in politics with all his former passion, and gives himself up, perhaps, rather more to his prejudices, which cling closer to his character, as the moss clings closer to the rock, until at last it seems to identify itself with it. He talked a great deal of the literary establishments in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; seemed to despise <placeName key="tgn,7009546" n="1.000 31" reg="edinburgh, scotland, united kingdom">Edinburgh</placeName>, where, he said, you would not get so much knowledge at a lecture as you would in the same time at an English gentleman's dinner-table; preferred <placeName reg="Oxford, Oxfordshire, England" key="tgn,7011931">Oxford</placeName> to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England" key="tgn,7010874">Cambridge</placeName>, though he is a Cantabrigian; spoke with galling contempt of <persName n="Monk,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00288.02194" reg="mostcommon:Monk,nomatch:0"><surname>Monk</surname></persName>; and, in short, seemed disposed to spare very little that came in his way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>His politics were even more outrageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>He still praised <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00288.02195" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,Lucien,,,:3"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, and entered into a defence of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0230.0014.00288.02196" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,James,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and his <name>Indian</name> warfare in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and seemed equally discontented with the <name>Ministry</name> and the <name>Opposition</name>, at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>Yet there is evidently not a real bitterness in his feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>He differs from most persons, even among his friends, but the reason is chiefly that he has lived so little in the world as hardly to be a part of it, and if he has any relationships, they are to an age that for us has gone by, of which he seems a rude but an imposing relic. . . . . Setting his learning aside,&mdash;where he still stands alone among English scholars,&mdash;there are <num value="2">two</num> traits in his character which would redeem greater faults; I mean his kindness, and the prevalent sense of religion, which seems always to be upon him, even when he is talking in his angriest moods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>I felt both when <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> I left him, and he said, <q direct="unspecified">I wish you would stay some days with me. We should have a great deal of good talk together; but if you ever come into this country again, I claim a week from you. But I am old, very old; I shall probably be gathered to the great company of the dead, and, I trust, to a better company in heaven; so that all I may give you now is the blessing of an old man, who wishes you well with all his heart.</q></p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>While I was in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> this time, I saw a good deal of <persName n="Mackintosh,Sir,James,,," id="n0230.0014.00289.02198" reg="default:Mackintosh,James,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Mackintosh</surname></persName>, who spent a part of the winter at <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Holland</foreName></persName>'s, the house I most frequented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>It was a small party in honor of the wedding of <persName n="Sismondi,,,,," id="n0230.0014.00290.02199" reg="mostcommon:Sismondi,Simonde,de,,:1"><surname>Sismondi</surname></persName>, who had, a few days earlier, married a sister of <persName n="Mackintosh,Lady,,,," id="n0230.0014.00290.02200" reg="nearbymention:Mackintosh,James,,,"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Mackintosh</surname></persName>, <persName n="Allen,Miss,,,," id="n0230.0014.00290.02201" reg="mostcommon:Allen,John,,,:2"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, a cultivated lady, who, with her <num value="2">two</num> sisters, I had seen often at <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>, and whom I felt that I already knew pretty well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>The house was filled; though, as a riot had been foreseen, few ladies were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>Before the curtain rose, <persName n="Kemble,,Stephen,,," id="n0230.0014.00291.02220" reg="default:Kemble,Stephen,,,"><foreName>Stephen</foreName> <surname>Kemble</surname></persName>, the manager,&mdash;a very respectable looking old man, with the marks of infirmity strong upon him,&mdash;came forward, but was received with such shouting and hooting by the pit, who thought the play ought to have been withdrawn, that he was not heard for a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>At last his venerable appearance and humble manner seemed to have softened the hard hearts of the mob a little; and, after many bows, he was allowed, though not without several indecent interruptions, to read a short address, promising, if the play was condemned, that it should be immediately withdrawn, though still begging a fair hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>Of the last there seemed to be some doubt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>The curtain rose and the actors began, but they were received with indignant cries and showers of orange-peels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>They persisted, however, and the house grew quieter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>The pit, indeed, seemed disposed to come to a compromise, and wait till the conclusion before it should enter into the exercise of its rights of condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>Still, it was apparent that the piece was already judged and sentenced, for every time that an actor said anything that could be forced to a bad sense, the audience took advantage of it. If he groaned, they groaned with comical dolorousness; if he complained, they complained most pertinaciously with him; and the words <q direct="unspecified">&apos;T is shameful,</q> <q direct="unspecified">&apos;T is villanous,</q> <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> were echoed several minutes by most of the pit, standing on the benches and swinging their hats, and crying out as loud as their voices would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>In this way, perhaps about <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of what was spoken might have been heard during the <num value="3">three</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts; the rest passed only in dumb show, drowned in the universal uproar.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>At the end of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> act the half-prices came in, as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>They had not heard the address, and knew nothing of the tacit compact between the pit and the manager; or, if they did, they cared nothing about it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>Off!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>prevailed over all others, and half the time the body of the pit was jumping on the benches, and making an uproar that was almost sufficient to burst the ears of those in the boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>The actors hurried on, skipped apparently half their parts, since not a syllable could be heard, and finally concluded in pantomime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>When it was finished, the uproar, which I thought before as intense as it could be, seemed to be doubled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>The only way anybody's opinion could be known was by placards, and many had come provided with them, and hoisted them on their canes or umbrellas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>At length the venerable old manager appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>He made a dozen of his humblest bows, but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/>He stretched out his hand, as if beseeching to be heard, and was answered only by louder and more vulgar outcries,. . . . and he was obliged to go off without having pronounced an audible word, after standing before his inexorable masters in that awkward and degrading situation above <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/><note anchored="yes"> 
<p>Translated from the <rs>Italian</rs>.</p></note>Yesterday evening I was told, by the <rs>Duc de Laval</rs>, of your affliction, my friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>For a long time I have wished to write to you, <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> for a long time I have delayed, for reasons I will tell you later; but there is no reason, and no business, which shall delay me longer, when I know you are unhappy, and that in your grief you doubt those whom you have inspired with a real friendship for you. I know by experience what it is to lose the person most dear to us, and on whom rested our hope of love, of comfort, and companionship for the whole of life; and I know, moreover, that under such misfortunes we easily suspect all our friends of forgetting us. You have, assuredly, at home, many persons who will be comforters to you, and who will prove their friendship for you. But I should like to prove to you that, excepting the friends of your childhood, you have none on whom you ought to count more than on me. I except those, because you, in talking with me, have several times excepted them, and, as it were, placed them out of the range of comparison with any friendship formed by you in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; but it seemed to me, even then, that, among <hi rend="italics">these</hi>, you made some account of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>I, on my part, can assure you, with sincerity, that not only for many years, but for all the years which I distinctly remember, I have never known any man whom I love so much, or by whom I so much desire to be loved, as by you. Such declarations would be needless, were it not that I know myself to be guilty of a long silence with you; and that I should be truly unhappy if, in your present circumstances, you should interpret this silence as a proof of forgetfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>Now I will tell you, not as apology, how I have been prevented so long from writing to you. . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>And now we are inevitably separated; and perhaps at this moment you are at sea, approaching another continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>And now, my friend, is the time to make firmer and closer the relations between us. And, if you are not unwilling, it seems to me these may be truly called friendship; for even without being able to gather from them the fruit that is commonly gathered, when <num value="1">one</num> lives near the other, it yet appears to me that, whether near or far, if there is true esteem,&mdash;conformity, in a great degree, of opinion,&mdash;affection,&mdash;desire of being useful to <num value="1">one</num> another, and to exchange mutual information of all that happens to each,--there is true friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>All this exists on my side, and I assure you of it, fully and sincerely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>In you I believe it did exist, and I hope that this my silence for some months past has not deprived me of the friendship you had for me, especially now when you know how it has come to pass that I have delayed writing to you as I wished to do, least of all when I add that I have just passed, in point of health, inward tranquillity, and satisfaction with myself, the worst <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> which have fallen to my lot for many years. . . . . <pb id="p.311" n="311"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>I must tell you that, forced by the diplomatic caution, and the vice of unpunctuality of the <rs>Duc de Laval</rs>, to give up the rides we used to take with him, I still find, in all other things, that it is difficult to meet a better man, in any class, or in any business, least of all in the business which is his, and mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>We have, therefore, remained quite intimate in our relations, in which I find no other defect in him than that of his want of confidence, for I am not so miserly of mine towards him, but give him, without claim of restitution, whatever I can give him.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3830"/>At last we reached the hill that opened the <rs type="place">Bay of Plymouth</rs> upon us, and it seemed in a moment as if I were at home, so familiar to me were the names and relations of everything I saw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3834"/>I have seldom had more lively feelings from the associations of place than I had when I stood on this blessed rock; and I doubt whether there be a place in the world where a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> man should feel more gratitude, pride, and veneration than when he stands where the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man stood who began the population and glory of his country.

<p>From this interesting monument I went up to the southern side of the sunny hill, which in that cold season probably tempted the fathers to establish themselves here, and where they pitched their tents the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night; and from there went to the height where the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victims of their sufferings and privations were secretly buried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>No stone marks the spot, and it is only the fidelity of an unquestionable tradition that has preserved its memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>It was now nearly dark, but still I was able to go and see the hill, or rather little mound, where <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Massasoit</foreName></persName> came, in the following spring, and held a conference with the poor reduced settlers, and gave them assurances of good &mdash; will which induced them to remain, and found an empire of whose greatness they little dreamt. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>This evening . . . . we have had a good deal of company, both old colonists and strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>At any rate, we found him very interesting, very curious, and very amusing. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>The whole town has the air of a fete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>The streets are filled with idlers, lounging about to see the curiosities, or people busily running to and fro, to get their quarters and make them comfortable; the houses and chambers are all lighted up, as if there was a party in every room, and a band of military music has been nearly all the time marching up and down the street, followed by the crowd and rabble, who seem to share not a little of the general enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>Everything, in short, gives token of a goodly day to-morrow. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>Yet I do not dare to trust myself about it, <pb id="p.330" n="330"/> and I warn you beforehand that I have not the least confidence in my own opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>His manner carried me away completely; not, I think, that I could have been so carried away if it had been a poor oration, for of that I apprehend there can be no fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>It <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have been a great, a very great performance, but whether it was so absolutely unrivalled as I imagined when I was under the immediate influence of his presence, of his tones, of his looks, I cannot be sure till I have read it, for it seems to me incredible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>It was on the point of time where we now stand, both in relation to our ancestors and to posterity; and he discussed it, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as to the <name>Pilgrims</name> who came here, what they suffered at home and on their arrival, and how different were the principles of colonization from those in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 4" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, and the <rs>East</rs> and <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>; secondly, as to the progress of the country, and its situation an <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> ago, compared with what it is now, in which he drew a fine character of <persName n="Adams,President,,,," id="n0230.0016.00330.02489" reg="nearbymention:Adams,J.,Q.,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>; thirdly, as to the principles of our governments, as free governments,&mdash;where he had a tremendous passage about slavery,&mdash;as governments that encourage education,&mdash;where there was a delightful compliment to <persName n="Kirkland,President,,,," id="n0230.0016.00330.02490" reg="mostcommon:Kirkland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Kirkland</surname></persName>,&mdash;and as governments founded on property; . . . . and finally, in the fourth place, as a great people welcoming its posterity to the enjoyment of blessings which all the rest of the world cannot offer, with which he ended in a magnificent flood of eloquence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>I was never so excited by public speaking before in my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/><num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times I thought my temples would burst with the gush of blood; for, after all, you must know that I am aware it is no connected and compacted whole, but a collection of wonderful fragments of burning eloquence, to which his manner gave tenfold force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>When I came out I was almost afraid to come near to him. It seemed to me as if he was like the mount that might not be touched, and that burned with fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>I was beside myself, and am so still.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>We went this morning to the <rs type="place">Registry Office</rs>, where are records of some sort or other, from as early as <dateStruct value="1623--"><year reg="1623">1623</year></dateStruct>, and where we saw the handwriting of the venerable Elder <persName n="Brewster,,,,," id="n0230.0016.00330.02491" reg="mostcommon:Brewster,nomatch:0"><surname>Brewster</surname></persName>, and all the documents that give us, as it were, a more distinct ancestry than any other people on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>There, if I understand the matter, the discussion still rests, so far as the external evidence is concerned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>As to the internal evidence, there is necessarily much more room for a free use of weapons, and, of course, the contest has ranged much more widely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3982"/>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> passages have been cited, full of the sincerest and most natural passion, to prove that nothing but a genuine attachment could have given birth to the whole series of poems; and these have been answered by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> others, composed of mere puns and conceits, which are as remote from nature as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>The <num value="1">one</num> you cite, of his strong impression that <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName> will retain in heaven the features he loved on earth, and that he shall see and love them again, is no doubt eminently natural; but it is applied, <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> in <persName n="Southey,,,,," id="n0230.0017.00343.02603" reg="mostcommon:Southey,Robert,,,:2"><surname>Southey</surname></persName>'s <q direct="unspecified">Curse of Kehama,</q> by <num value="1">one</num> imaginary being to another, and therefore might have been well applied by a real poet to a fancied mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>I remember, too, to have seen, somewhere, great trust put upon the exquisite phrase, <q direct="unspecified">lasciando tenebroso, onde si move,</q> as too fresh from the heart of a lover to be considered mere poetry; and yet <persName n="Milton,,,,," id="n0230.0017.00343.02604" reg="mostcommon:Milton,nomatch:0"><surname>Milton</surname></persName> has made <persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n0230.0017.00343.02605" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName> say of Eve, <q direct="unspecified">She disappeared, and left me dark,</q> and <persName n="Spenser,,,,," id="n0230.0017.00343.02606" reg="mostcommon:Spenser,nomatch:0"><surname>Spenser</surname></persName>, reversing the medal, says, yet more beautifully, of Una, that <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>I am not, however, willing to say that <persName n="Petrarch,,,,," id="n0230.0017.00343.02608" reg="mostcommon:Petrarch,nomatch:0"><surname>Petrarch</surname></persName> found nothing in nature to give him the intimation of the being he has idealized and called <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>; nor am I willing to abandon those dates which he has given with so much exactness in his Sonnets, and which I remember, also, to have seen in his own exquisite Gothic hand, in his copy of <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName>, recording the time when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw her, and the time of her death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>It seems to me it cannot <hi rend="italics">all</hi> have been a mere fiction; and yet I think that the fat, happy, patriotic citizen and poet, who travelled all over <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and who studied more books than any mian of his time, and who lived so much in the houses and confidence of Princes and Cardinals, is little likely to have been the pining, suffering lover he so exquisitely represents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>That he was in love, I do not doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>That he chose a lady of his heart, that he saw her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> at church, in <dateStruct value="1327-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1327">1327</year></dateStruct>, and that she died in <dateStruct value="1348--"><year reg="1348">1348</year></dateStruct>,&mdash;as he has so exactly marked it in his Sonnets,&mdash;seems all very reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>But it remains to be proved from his works, or in any other way, that he was among her acquaintance or friends, or that he ever spoke to her. Not <num value="1">one</num> line intimates that she ever vouchsafed him a word of kindness or favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>He was satisfied, I apprehend, to consider her a bright and beautiful vision; <q direct="unspecified">to behold though but her utmost skirts of glory, and far off her steps adore.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>He formed a circle of dreams and wishes for his heart, and she was the centre of them, but that was all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>The thought of her in another and better world rather gave his fancy a new means and freer excitement; and as he had already, during <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, employed his imagination in decorating her with unearthly charms, so now he continued yet <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> longer, with rather increased enthusiasm, until the flame, which had been nourished almost entirely by his fancy, was at last extinguished of itself.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4158"/>It is, I think, an unfortunate circumstance, that all our colleges have been so long considered merely places for obtaining a degree of <rs type="role" reg="Bachelor of Arts">Bachelor of Arts</rs>, to serve as a means and certificate whereon to build the future plans and purposes of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4159"/>Such a state of things was, indeed, unavoidable at the earlier period of our College, when there <pb id="p.357" n="357"/> was only a President, who sometimes lived permanently in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and a few tutors, who kept a school in <placeName reg="Newton, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050214">Newton</placeName>; for the number of scholars was so small that it was possible to teach only by classes, and each student, the number being also small, could pass through the hands of every <num value="1">one</num> of them, and receive from every <num value="1">one</num> all the instruction he could give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>But now the state of the case is reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4161"/>There are <num value="20">twenty</num> or more teachers, and <num value="300">three hundred</num> students, and yet the division into classes remains exactly the same, and every student is obliged to pass through the hands of nearly or quite every instructor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>Of course, the recitations become mere examinations, and it cannot be attempted to give more than the most superficial view of very important subjects, even to those who would gladly investigate them thoroughly, because they must keep with the class to which they are bound, and hurry on from a teacher and a subject to which they have, perhaps, important reasons for being attached, to another teacher and another subject, wherein their present dispositions and final pursuits in life make it impossible for them to feel any interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4163"/>But at the same time that we at once perceive this system . . . . has been carried too far, . . . . we must still feel that it has in some respects its peculiar advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4164"/>The majority of the young men who come to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> should not be left entirely to themselves to choose what they will study, because they are not competent to judge what will be most important for them; and yet no parent would wish to have his child pursue branches of knowledge which he is sure can never be of use to him in future life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>A beneficial compromise can, however, as it seems to me, be effected between the old system still in operation and the most liberal concessions that would be demanded by <num value="1">one</num> of the merely free and philosophical universities of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.</p></quote> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4167"/>Now if this be the condition of the <rs type="place">College</rs>, which I do not doubt, or if anything like it exist there, which nobody will deny, it is perfectly apparent that a great and thorough change must take place in its discipline and instruction; not to bring it up to the increasing demands of the community, but to make it fulfil the purposes of a <hi rend="italics">respectable <orgName n="High School" type="school">high school</orgName></hi>, to which young men may be safely sent to be prepared for the study of a profession.</p></quote> <pb id="p.358" n="358"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4169"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>Whenever the tribunal of <num value="3">three</num> are satisfied that a young man does not fulfil the purposes for which he came to College, they should be required instantly to dismiss him, for his own sake, for the sake of his friends, and for the sake of the <rs type="place">College</rs>, since from that moment he becomes a nuisance; for, if it be mere dulness, he is out of his place and lowers the standard of merit, and if it be idleness, folly, or vice, he is continually spreading mischief around him. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/>The whole movement was an effort to carry the institution through a state of transition, gradually moulding it into a broader and freer form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>The immediate abolition of the system of classes, of a <hi rend="italics">curriculum</hi> and a degree, could not be undertaken, nor could the teaching of many of the professors be emancipated from the special spheres imposed by the donors of their foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>But the cardinal features of the new plan were these: the division of the whole institution into <hi rend="italics">departments</hi>, with the right of a limited choice of studies; the separation of the members of a class for their exercises, according to their proficiency, so that each division might be carried forward as rapidly as was consistent with thoroughness, every man having a right to make progress according to his industry and capacity; and the opening of the <rs type="place">College</rs> to those who wished to pursue special studies, without taking a degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4213"/>He made it equally plain that the existing pecuniary means of the <rs type="place">College</rs> were sufficient-if rightly used&mdash;to put these innovations to a fair and proper test.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4214"/>Having discussed all these topics with great fulness, he closed with a vigorous passage on the absolute necessity of introducing greater thoroughness into the processes of teaching:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> point that I believe must be made a sort of cynosure, when beneficial changes are undertaken, both at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> and at our other colleges; and that is, the principle of thorough <hi rend="italics">teaching</hi>. On this point, it is desirable to be perfectly plain, and to be very plainly understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4216"/>It is a small matter to diminish the unreasonable amount of holidays, or to give the students more and longer lessons, under a division according to proficiency, or to do almost anything else, if the principle of <hi rend="italics">teaching</hi> is still to be overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4217"/>For the most that an instructor now undertakes in our colleges is to ascertain, from day to day, whether the young men who are assembled in his presence have probably studied the lesson prescribed to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4218"/>There <pb id="p.363" n="363"/> his duty stops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4219"/>If the lesson have been learnt, it is well; if it have not, nothing remains but punishment, after a sufficient number of such offences shall have been accumulated to demand it; and then it comes, halting after the delinquent, he hardly knows why. The idea of a thorough commentary on the lesson; the idea of making the explanations and illustrations of the teacher of as much consequence as the recitation of the book, or even more, is substantially unknown in this country, except at a few preparatory schools.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4220"/>The consequence is, that, though many of our colleges may have a valuable apparatus for instruction, though they may be very good, quiet, and secluded places for study, and though many of the young men who resort thither may really learn not a little of what is exacted or expected from them, yet, after all, not <num value="1">one</num> of our colleges is a place for thorough <hi rend="italics">teaching;</hi> and not <num value="1">one</num> of the better class of them does half of what it might do, by bringing the minds of its instructors to act directly and vigorously on the minds of its pupils, and thus to encourage, enable, and compel them to learn what they ought to learn, and what they easily might learn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4221"/>Consider, only, that as many years are given to the great work of education here as are given in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and that it costs more money with us to be very imperfectly educated than it does to enjoy the great advantages of some of the best institutions and universities on the <name>Continent</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4222"/>And yet, who in this country, by means here offered him, has been enabled to make himself a good <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> scholar?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4223"/>Who has been taught thoroughly to read, write, and speak Latin?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4224"/>Nay, who has been taught anything, at our colleges, with the thoroughness that will enable him to go safely and directly onward to distinction in the department he has thus entered, without returning to lay anew the foundations for his success?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4225"/>It is a shame to be obliged to ask such questions; and yet there is but <num value="1">one</num> answer to them, and those who have visited and examined the great schools of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have bitterly felt, there, what this answer is, and why it must be given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4226"/>In some of our colleges there may be a reason for this state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4227"/>Their means are small, their apparatus incomplete, their instructors few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4260"/>The justice and benefit of such an administration of the law was plainly felt by all the <num value="55">fifty-five</num>, nor has there been a murmur or complaint against it, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment of its application in French to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4266"/>The difference, therefore, in the effect produced by the application of the law in French and in the other studies was not owing to any such circumstance as has been suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4267"/>If the difference in original qualifications had been all, the law, as it was applied, would have been more odious in French than in anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>my dear <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>,&mdash;Your <num value="2">two</num> letters, breathing the very spirit of affection and sympathy, have been welcome indeed to us. Such kindness is the earthly consolation appointed for sorrow; and I need not tell you, who have suffered, how much we prize and cherish it. I am, however, somewhat surprised at the feelings that fill my thoughts, they are so different from what I anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>While my little boy lived, I looked only to the future, and considered him only as a bright hope, that was growing brighter every day. But now that he is gone I look at the past and the present, and, yielding all the future, in a spirit of resignation, to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I feel the immediate <hi rend="italics">loss</hi>, the pressing <hi rend="italics">want</hi> of something that was so dear to me, and that was associated, without my knowing it, to everything around and within me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>Thus I am sad, very sad; not because I am disappointed, not because I can no longer look to my child as the support and comfort of my declining years, but because I can no longer see his bright smile or hear his glad voice; because I turn my head suddenly, at some familiar sound, and he is not there; because I listen, and it is not his light step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>Why it should be so I cannot tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>Perhaps this sense of present loss, overwhelming the feeling of hopes destroyed, is to continue only for a time; perhaps it is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step towards that entire resignation and acquiescence which I strive to obtain, and which I know I am required to offer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>my dear <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>,&mdash;Besides wishing you a happy New Year, I have a word to say about myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>I have substantially resigned my place at <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0230.0020.00399.03108" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,Stephen,,,:2"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName> is substantially appointed to fill it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>This is an arrangement I have had at heart a good while, but could not well accomplish earlier, partly because my department, being a new <num value="1">one</num>, was not brought, until lately, into a good condition to leave, and partly because I was unwilling to seem to give up the <rs type="place">College</rs> during the troubles of the late rebellion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>. . . . I have been an active professor these <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure>, and for <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of the time I have been contending, against a constant opposition, to procure certain changes which should make the large means of the <rs type="place">College</rs> more effectual for the education of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>In my own department I have succeeded entirely, but I can get these changes carried no further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>As long as I hoped to advance them, I continued attached to the <rs type="place">College</rs>; when I gave up all hope, I determined to resign . . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/>The fact that I am to be free in a year makes me so already in spirit; and I look back upon my past course at the <rs type="place">College</rs> almost entirely as matter of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/>There is a good deal in it that gratifies me. During the <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of my connection with it as a teacher, more than half the instruction I have given has been voluntary, neither required nor contemplated by my statutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>When the finances of the <rs type="place">College</rs> became embarrassed, <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> ago, I volunteered the resignation of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure> out of the stipulated salary of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1000</measure>, and have never received but <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>During the <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> a department of the modern languages has existed,<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/> 
<p>The creation of departments had been <num value="1">one</num> of the points of reform urged in <dateStruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></dateStruct>, but carried into effect only for the modern languages.</p></note> with <num value="4">four</num> foreigners for teachers, who are generally more likely to have difficulties with the students than natives, no case whatsoever has been carried before the <name>Faculty</name>, and during the whole <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> I have never myself been absent from an exercise, or tardy at <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>Moreover, within the limits of the department I have entirely broken up the division of classes, established fully the principle and practice of progress according to proficiency, and introduced a system of voluntary study, which for several years has embraced from <num value="140">one hundred and forty</num> to <num value="160">one hundred and sixty</num> students; so that we have relied hardly at all on College discipline, as it is called, but almost entirely on the good dispositions of the young men, and their desire to learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>If, therefore, the department of the modern languages is right, the rest of the <rs type="place">College</rs> is wrong; and if the rest of the <rs type="place">College</rs> is right, we ought to adopt its system, which I believe no person whatsoever has thought desirable, for the last <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>. . . . . <pb id="p.401" n="401"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>In my whole connection with it, I feel as if I had been as much actuated by a sense of duty to improve the institution, and serve the community, as men in public places commonly are. So, I doubt not, are those who have the management of the <rs type="place">College</rs>, and pursue the opposite course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>I do not know that it could be in the hands of abler men, or men more disinterested; certainly not of men for whom I have a greater regard or respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>We differ, however, very largely, both as to what the <rs type="place">College</rs> can be, and what it ought to be. We therefore separate, as men who go different roads, though proposing the same end, each persuaded the <num value="1">one</num> he prefers is the best, the pleasantest, and the shortest.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>At the moment when, with a gentle breeze, we felt as if we should reach our port in a few hours, when, in fact, I was sitting quietly in the cabin, writing a letter to announce our arrival, the wind came out suddenly ahead, and almost at once blew a gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>It was not without much difficulty and tacking all day, that we got round <placeName key="tgn,7013189" n="1.000 3" reg="holyhead,holy island,anglesey,wales,united kingdom,europe">Holyhead</placeName> and <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> the <name>Skerries</name>, and lay to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>It seemed now and then as if all its waters were swept together into mountainous heaps by the violence of the gale, so that we saw the bottom and its yellow sands; for while the wind carried us [under bare poles] <num value="12">twelve</num> knots an hour, the tide carried us <num value="6">six</num> more.

The waves <hi rend="italics">seemed</hi> higher than they do in a gale on the ocean, because they could be measured by objects on the shores; but they were not really so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>She dictated these particular passages because, as they <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> were to represent narrative conversation, she thought this mode of composing them would give them a more natural air, and whenever her sister's pen hesitated, she altered the word at once.

<p>But though she talked thus freely about herself and her works, she never introduced the subject, and never seemed glad to continue it. She talked quite as well, and with quite as much interest, on everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>Indeed, though I watched carefully for it, I could not detect, on the <num value="1">one</num> side, any of the mystification of authorship, nor, on the other, any of its vanity. . . . . The sustained tone of conversation, however, with her unquenchable vivacity, was, I think,&mdash;continued as it was through so long a day,&mdash;a little fatiguing to her. She was just the same to the last moment,&mdash;just as quick in repartee, and just as gay in her allusions and remarks,&mdash;but her countenance showed that her physical strength was hardly equal to it. Indeed, she is of a feeble constitution naturally, though for the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> she has gained strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>It was, therefore, something of a trial to talk so brilliantly and variously as she did, from <time value="9am">nine in the morning</time> till past <num value="11">eleven</num> at night.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>The church is small, but neat, and their pew is the place of honor in it, with a canopy and recess as large as any <num value="2">two</num> other pews. . . . . On <num value="1">one</num> side of the altar was a small, plain, oval tablet, to the memory of their grandfather, bearing no inscription but his name, and the time of his birth and death; and on the other side was <num value="1">one</num> exactly like it,. . . . to their father, who died in <dateStruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>The whole had the air of decency and reverence that ought always to be found in a village church; but the sermon was Calvinistic, from a young man, and the congregation very small, making a striking contrast to the congregation which poured out from the <rs type="place">Catholic chapel</rs> in the neighborhood, so as to fill and throng the highway.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>The <rs>Edgeworths</rs> have always been on the most kindly terms with their Catholic neighbors and tenantry, but, like many other Protestants whom I have met, they feel rather uncomfortably at the encroaching spirit which the <rs>Emancipation Bill</rs> has awakened in the whole Catholic population of the island, and the exclusive character and tone assumed by the priests, who have every day, as they assure me, more and more the air of claiming superiority; especially where, as in the case of Edgeworthtown, the old priests have been removed, and Jesuits placed in their stead.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>I remembered the simple, handsome staircase, and the statues that ornament it, perfectly well; but the rooms we saw, not being the common household rooms, were entirely new to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>They were, however, anything rather than cheerful and agreeable rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/>I should, indeed, hardly have called them comfortable; but he occupied them for nearly <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, and they are, therefore, curious, but nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>The sleeping-room was a wretched little closet, with <num value="1">one</num> window and no fireplace, a very ordinary bed without curtains, and the poor armchair in which he died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5291"/>The whole was, indeed, very <hi rend="italics">triste</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5292"/></p> 
<p>The other rooms contained his different collections in science and the arts; a very good cabinet for mineralogy and geology, a great deal in botany, quantities of small remains of antiquity, Roman and <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, and copies of such remains, medals, and coins in great abundance, drawings and engravings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>Of the last the number was enormous; many <num value="1000">thousand</num>, arranged according to the schools and masters, and on the whole more interesting than anything else I saw in the house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/>The whole, in the way it is now exhibited, seemed to me a monument of the vanity of a man who was spoiled by a life &mdash; a <hi rend="italics">very long</hi> life&mdash;of constant, uniform success, every wish not only fulfilled but anticipated, so that he came at last to think whatever related to himself to be of great consequence to the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>He therefore published, or left orders to publish, everything he had ever written, much of which is mere waste-paper; and now his will further directs all the little commonplace arrangements of a very ordinary study and sleeping-room to be shown to strangers, as matters of moment and <pb id="p.456" n="456"/> interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5501"/>It was less complete than I expected to find it, but more curious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5502"/>I made a good many memoranda, and shall turn the visit to good account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5503"/>He was, I thought, free in showing me everything, conscientious in confessing to some little oversights and ignorances, and glad to get any hints that will be useful to him hereafter; but, on the whole, it is quite plain his study of <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0230.0024.00472.03787" reg="mostcommon:Dante,di,,,:1"><surname>Dante</surname></persName> has been most thorough, and that his knowledge and feeling of the power and beauty of the <name>Inferno</name> and Purgatorio are really extraordinary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5504"/>With the <name>Paradiso</name> he has not yet made a beginning; I mean, with its translation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5517"/>His reading was admirable in all respects; sometimes very curious and striking to me, because his tones and manner, now and then, gave a small shade of difference to the interpretation of a passage from what I had been accustomed to give it, or hear given to it on the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5518"/>His conception of <persName n="Falstaff,,,,," id="n0230.0024.00473.03795" reg="mostcommon:Falstaff,nomatch:0"><surname>Falstaff</surname></persName>'s character was more like <persName n="Cooke,,,,," id="n0230.0024.00473.03796" reg="mostcommon:Cooke,G.,F.,,:1"><surname>Cooke</surname></persName>'s, and less like <persName n="Bartley,,,,," id="n0230.0024.00473.03797" reg="mostcommon:Bartley,nomatch:0"><surname>Bartley</surname></persName>'s, than any I recollect; that is, more intellectual, and less jovial, less vulgar; and the conception of the <rs>King</rs>'s character was more violent and angry than I have been used to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5521"/>This reading is an exercise of which he is very fond, and in which he often indulges his friends, and the society that assembles at his house every evening; but for the last <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> he has had a cough and abstained entirely, so that I have never heard him before to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5522"/>He never goes out to walk or take exercise, and his physician&mdash;Carus&mdash;says these readings are physically useful to him as substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5523"/>He gave me my choice of what he should read, <hi rend="italics">after I</hi> arrived, so that there was no possibility of preparation; and he read the whole through at once, without the least pause, without speaking or being spoken to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5531"/>Indeed, the whole affair was above me, and, as very little conversation could be enjoyed, I did not stay it out.</p>

In the midst of these comforts, then, we found him, and quite able, from the freshness of his faculties, to enjoy them all. His hair is white and very neatly combed back; his dress more cared for than is common in old men in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 5" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>; his manners kind, and even courteous; and his conversation and sympathy quite ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5536"/>He prefers to talk of old times, and lives in the midst of the portraits of generations gone by. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5920"/>It was like a separate establishment of dining-rooms, saloons, etc., and near it were the private apartments of the <rs>Count</rs> and <rs>Countess</rs>, with their daughters, including his private library of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4000">four thousand</num> volumes; separate sitting-rooms for each, and so on, all very nice and comfortable .. . . .

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5921"/>This morning they took us to the other side of the pile, where we passed through the billiard-room, and I know not how many suites of apartments for guests, to the chapel, capable of containing about <num value="300">three hundred</num> persons, besides the gallery for the family, and where mass is performed every day, prayers chanted at morning, noon, and night, and the regular service on <date value="--7">Sundays</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5922"/>On this side of the castle is <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> dining-room, with antechambers, etc., where they dine in the hottest weather. . . . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5923"/>But there must be an end to all things, and the time had now come when our visit must be closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>The greater part of the way the country, though highly cultivated, was uninteresting; we passed for miles through monotonous fields of waving corn, . . . . passing, as it were, over a vast prairie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5928"/>It is certainly <num value="1">one</num> of the most picturesque cities I have ever seen, standing on <num value="5">five</num> hills, with great masses of buildings in every direction, broken by an uncommon number of old steeples, towers, and domes, while the river, crossed by its ancient and highly ornamented bridge, sweeps majestically through the midst of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5933"/>It is very crowded, dirty, and disagreeable; for, as they are not allowed to live anywhere else, and have constantly been increasing, they have become packed together in an extraordinary manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5934"/>Their burial-ground is curious, with its heavy gravestones, covered with long Hebrew inscriptions, but it is even more crowded with the dead than their streets are with the living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5935"/>The stones almost constantly touch each other, so that if as many have been buried here as are indicated, they must rest in tiers, <num value="1">one</num> above the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5940"/>The estate still exists, of enormous extent, and the square before it is still called <address><street n="Waldstein's Square">Waldstein's Square</street></address>. . . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>It is like a city within a city, so wide do its squares and courts extend.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5944"/>The library contains about <num value="93000">ninety-three thousand</num> volumes, a beggarly matter for such an institution; and, what is worse, they looked as if they belonged to the studies of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> and <num value="17" type="ordinal">seventeenth</num> centuries, rather than to those of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num>. <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the manuscripts interested me very much.
