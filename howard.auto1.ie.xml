<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>It is difficult for the human mind to determine what is its earliest recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Connected with the place where I was born, the remembrance that is most distinct is of an occurrence which took place when I was <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> old. There is a dreamy sensation connected with the preceding, and with much of that which was subsequent to this <num value="1">one</num> event.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>My parents lived in a large, plain, <num value="2">two</num>-story frame house, facing toward a <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> road about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile westward from it. The front hall on the west side was remarkable for the broad frieze extending around it, on which was inscribed in plain letters, near the ceiling, the name of my grandfather, <persName n="Howard,,Seth,,," id="n0173.0002.00003.00001" reg="default:Howard,Seth,,,"><foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, repeated as often as necessary to the completion of the border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The kitchen part, the sheds, the corn building, and the barn began at the northeast corner of the house and extended in broken lines to the orchard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>The main house had upon it a roof comparatively flat, with a small portion fenced in at the crest by a balustrade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The house was upon the <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> northern slope of <quote>the great hill</quote> of <placeName key="tgn,7010442;tgn,2045053" n="0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,7010442;leeds,leeds,england,united kingdom,europe,Leeds,England,United Kingdom,Europe;0.000 000000.0000	placename;tgn,2045053;leeds, androscoggin, maine,Androscoggin,Maine,United States,North and Central America" reg="leeds,leeds,england,united kingdom,europe,Leeds,England,United Kingdom,Europe;leeds, androscoggin, maine,Androscoggin,Maine,United States,North and Central America">Leeds</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>With its tall chimneys, its balustrade, its white color, and green blinds, the structure was as noticeable as a lighthouse upon a promontory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>It was seen and known for miles around as the residence of <persName n="Howard,Captain,Seth,,," id="n0173.0002.00004.00002" reg="default:Howard,Seth,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>At that time the family consisted of my father (<persName n="Howard,,Rowland,Bailey,," id="n0173.0002.00004.00003" reg="default:Howard,Rowland,Bailey,,"><foreName>Rowland</foreName> <foreName>Bailey</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>), my mother, and my grandfather, who was a little past <num value="70">seventy</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Occasionally a neighbor, assisting father in the work of the farm, sat at our table, but habitually we <num value="4">four</num> made up the household.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>During the winter, probably in <dateStruct value="1834-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>, just before night set in, I was looking out of the south window of mother's sitting room and saw something new and startling to me. It was a team of horses hauling a pung with high, brightly painted sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Just above the pung body on a cross box were seated <num value="2">two</num> men, warmly dressed, having on mufflers, fur caps, and mittens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was driving the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Openmouthed sleigh bells were attached to the shafts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The team stopped near our side door, the driver gave his reins to the other man, and ran up to the house and knocked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>My father went out to meet him, and after a little conversation the horses were taken from the pung, properly stabled, and the men came in and took supper with the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I was permitted to sit up during that memorable evening, being too excited to think of sleep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the front hall my father's cornsheller was placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Why it was put there that night I never could tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>There was a bin of unshelled corn in the northwest room where stood my mother's loom and all that belonged to it, not used in the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The corn on the cob was brought and put through the machine, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> <num value="1">one</num> of the men turning the crank and the other feeding it in. I saw the cobs fly in <num value="1">one</num> direction, the dust in another, and the shelled corn fall into its proper receptacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was put into bags and carried out every now and then by the men and emptied into the body of the pung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This went on till that singular sleigh was heavily loaded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>After this operation, so absorbing to a child, we all gathered in the sitting room, where a table was spread with refreshments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There was a cheerful fire in the old-fashioned fire-frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>As the party drew their chairs in social order so as to look at the fire, everything appeared unusually pleasant, and I am sure that my grandfather and <num value="1">one</num> of the strangers had lighted their pipes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>My father said, as his curious little boy was noticed: <quote><persName n="Otis,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00005.00004" reg="nearbymention:Otis,John,,,"><surname>Otis</surname></persName>, you must speak your piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Step up on the bench there beside the door.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I did so. My father then said: <quote>Now, <persName n="Otis,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00005.00005" reg="nearbymention:Otis,John,,,"><surname>Otis</surname></persName>, make your bow and go on.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I did the best I could and stammered through that wonderful speech which children learn without knowing for many years its meaning: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/></p><l>You'd scarce expect <num value="1">one</num> of my age</l> <l>To speak in public on the stage,</l> <l>And if I chance to fall below</l> <l><persName n="Demosthenes,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00005.00006" reg="mostcommon:Demosthenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Demosthenes</surname></persName> or <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,nomatch:0"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>,</l> <l>Don't view me with a critic's eye,</l> <l>But pass my imperfections by.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This was the event, and the whole sweet picture of it is still before me, more than <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> after its occurrence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Grandfather, with his thin, silvery hair and very genial face, was already infirm with age. He helped <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> mother about the house more than he did father in the farm work, yet he did many chores in the woodhouse and in the garden and around the barn, which gave father hours of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>My father, a man about <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <num value="11">eleven</num> in height, with dark-brown hair and sandy whiskers, which he wore at the sides of his face, was not very strong and often tortured with rheumatic attacks, yet he resolutely did the farm work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>To me now it is wonderful how much he accomplished in the course of a year, for the winter never set in till the cellar was well replenished with meat, vegetables, and fruit, ample for a comfortable living and sufficient for our wants.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Coming with his young wife to his father in <placeName reg="Leeds, Androscoggin, Maine" key="tgn,2045053">Leeds, Me.</placeName>, some <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> before, he had succeeded in freeing the farm from a heavy mortgage and in giving support to all his household.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>That farm, nearly half of which was wood and pasture land, did not exceed <measure n="80acres" type="area">eighty acres</measure>. We had several cows, a yoke of oxen, and between <num value="50">fifty</num> and <num value="60">sixty</num> sheep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We raised hens and turkeys in sufficient numbers for our home use, and had also a beautiful apple orchard, which never failed the family in its fruitfulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>My father's fondness for horses helped increase his income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He would buy up <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num>, as many as his stables would hold, and train them carefully, feeding them well for a few months, then lead or drive them to the nearest market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He succeeded in this trading so well that he was able to clear the farm of its obligation sooner than he could have done by the ordinary profits from the crops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I love to think of my father and to remember how fond he was of music and how sweetly he played of <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> an evening upon his flute, while my mother and sometimes others sang to this accompaniment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He was fond of books, and poetry was his delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>To me he seemed, as a rule, stern and unbending, but I am sure from what many have told me that there was never a man prouder of his children or more faithful to them during his short life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>My grandfather, <persName n="Howard,Captain,Seth,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00008" reg="default:Howard,Seth,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, was, next to my mother, my favorite companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>His usual stories concerned the <rs>Revolutionary War</rs>, in which he had served, during the last part, as a private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Subsequently during <name>Indian</name> troubles he obtained the rank of captain in the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He was born in <placeName reg="Bridgewater, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049517">Bridgewater, Mass.</placeName>, and was known as <quote><persName n="Howard,Captain,Seth,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00009" reg="default:Howard,Seth,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName></quote> in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, as in <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> after his migration to that State, which was on his arrival but a province, a part of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>His father was <persName n="Howard,,Jesse,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00010" reg="default:Howard,Jesse,,,"><foreName>Jesse</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, who at the breaking out of the <name>Revolutionary</name> struggle entered the service against the <rs>British</rs> as a lieutenant in <orgName n="company"><persName n="Ames,Captain,,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00011" reg="mostcommon:Ames,Adelbert,,,:2"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ames</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>; he was subsequently a captain himself, according to the <name>Bridgewater</name> record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Tracing the family back through <num value="3">three</num> generations beyond <persName><foreName>Jesse</foreName></persName>, we find <persName n="Howard,,John,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00012" reg="default:Howard,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, who was an aide and helper to Miles Standish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>This <persName n="Howard,,John,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00013" reg="default:Howard,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName> came from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> shortly after the arrival of the <hi rend="italics">Mayflower</hi>. If a Howard can trace his relatives in the line of heredity to <placeName reg="Bridgewater, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049517">Bridgewater</placeName>, he is almost sure to belong to the very numerous family of which <persName n="Howard,,John,,," id="n0173.0002.00007.00014" reg="default:Howard,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName> was the progenitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The <name>English</name> connection is not so very clear and to me it does not seem important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is, however, a source of gratification to a man to find his family tree representing men exceptionally industrious and respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><pb id="p.8" n="8"/></p> 
<p>A little later, during that same winter of the cornshelling incident, another event impressed me. Early <num value="1">one</num> day my mother dressed me and herself with warm wraps and we joined my father in his sleigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The weather was exceedingly cold, so that to keep me from being nipped with the frost I was made to sit down on a little bench under the <quote>buffalo.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I am confident that there was a piece of <rs n="oak wood" type="product">oak wood</rs> there which had been previously heated before the fireplace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It kept my mother's feet warm and was a comfort to me, so that I soon fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>When I wakened we had reached the lake, then called <placeName reg="Wayne Pond">Wayne Pond</placeName>, and were riding across it on the ice. The crushing of the snow, the sound of the bells, and the peculiar gliding motion of the sleigh have left their impression upon my memory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Just at dark we stopped at a tavern in New Sharon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>My mother and I entered the tavern through a dark entry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The office room was heated by an oldfashioned <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00008.00015" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> stove and we went to it to get warm, for in spite of all precautions we were chilled by the ride.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>My mother not noticing me, I started back to join my father and opened the door, as I supposed, into the dark entry, but it proved to be the cellar way, equally dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>I rolled down the stairs from top to bottom, making my nose bleed and bruising my forehead, but without much other damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>A tall man came and picked up the little bundle of a boy and brought him to his mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Just then my father came in, and I never quite forgave him for reproving my mother for not having taken better care of <persName n="Otis,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00008.00016" reg="nearbymention:Otis,John,,,"><surname>Otis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Indeed, <persName n="Otis,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00008.00017" reg="nearbymention:Otis,John,,,"><surname>Otis</surname></persName> was wholly to blame.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The next day we proceeded to <placeName reg="Bangor, Penobscot, Maine" key="tgn,7013355">Bangor, Me.</placeName> There <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> <num value="2">two</num> things occurred which have become part of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><num value="1">One</num> was the impression produced by <persName n="Richmond,Mrs.,,,," id="n0173.0002.00009.00018" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Richmond</surname></persName>'s large music box that she wound up several times for my benefit, and the other was a misfortune which I had while playing with a little girl about my age. I shut the door upon her fingers, without meaning to do so, nearly crushing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A young man with a stiff leg, supporting himself on crutches, rushed upon me, seized me, gave me a shaking, and a good scolding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>My heart was broken already when he came because of the afflicting accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Imagine then my complete prostration and long sobbing after the chastisement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Surely I learned a wholesome life lesson from that occurrence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct>, when I was <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of age, I began to go to the district school, nearly <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> south of our home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>From that time I continued, <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs>, to attend till my father's death, which occurred during the spring after I was <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> of age. This school-going was a marked period in my boyhood life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We had a change of teachers each <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> term, and I recall to-day the names and faces of those teachers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>When there were <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> scholars and the school was not graded, it was an exceedingly hard task which any teacher had to so arrange that every scholar should have an opportunity to receive his personal instruction in some branch of the curriculum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Reading, writing, and spelling were for all. Geography, arithmetic, and <name>English</name> grammar were for those who were advanced enough to be classified in these branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I was fond of my teachers, and remember distinctly that I could be governed by kindness and by praise, interspersed with an occasional punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><pb id="p.10" n="10"/></p> 
<p><num value="1">One</num> of my earliest instructors was <persName n="Murray,,Ben,,," id="n0173.0002.00010.00019" reg="default:Murray,Ben,,,"><foreName>Ben</foreName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>To keep me out of mischief he would take me and put me in his lap and let me play with his watch chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A little later <persName n="Moore,,Elizabeth,,," id="n0173.0002.00010.00020" reg="default:Moore,Elizabeth,,,"><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName> would try to shame me by making me sit with the big girls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><persName n="Knapp,,Hannah,,," id="n0173.0002.00010.00021" reg="default:Knapp,Hannah,,,"><foreName>Hannah</foreName> <surname>Knapp</surname></persName>, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, kept me in at recess on a back seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Here I shed some tears and meanwhile surreptitiously drew out the ginger cake from my dinner, which had been placed for safety on the little shelf below the desk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I had hard work to eat the dry cake for the crying and the scattering of the crumbs from my overfull cheeks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><persName n="Bridgham,,Thomas,,," id="n0173.0002.00010.00022" reg="default:Bridgham,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Bridgham</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> winter, was obliged to punish me with the ferule, giving several smart slaps upon the palm of the hand, because I went off with some other boys at recess to search for spruce gum and did not return in time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Indeed, I had learned to read by my mother's care before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> school, and progress was always steady and rapid enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>As a lad I was not complained of for want of quickness or intelligence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The larger schooling came from the outside, from the <num value="3">three</num>-score of boys and girls with whom I associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Scarcely <num value="1">one</num> of them is alive to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>There were among the boys those who had every characteristic of sturdy <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> lads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>As a rule, the roughest plays were our delight, and I had a very early ambition to be a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><persName n="Knapp,,Rufus,,," id="n0173.0002.00010.00023" reg="default:Knapp,Rufus,,,"><foreName>Rufus</foreName> <surname>Knapp</surname></persName> was at least <num value="16">sixteen</num> when I was <num value="8">eight</num>, jovial with the younger boys, but huge in size, strong and sinewy as an athlete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I used to combine my forces from the small boys and lead them to attack him simply with a view of throwing him to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I would <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dive for his legs, and no matter how much I was bruised I <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> led those attacks with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/><persName n="Rufus,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00011.00024" reg="mostcommon:Rufus,nomatch:0"><surname>Rufus</surname></persName> never was angry and laughed at the rest of us when we piled upon his prostrate form and held his arms and legs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion something that has been a characteristic in later life showed itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Several boys were on their way to school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>There had been a freshet, and the deep ditches were full of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>At <num value="1">one</num> place there was quite an excavation comparatively full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The surface in the early morning was skimmed over with thin ice. <persName n="Millet,,Henry,,," id="n0173.0002.00011.00025" reg="default:Millet,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Millet</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the companions of about my age, called out and said: <quote>Ote, you dasn't slide across that ditch!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>As quick as thought I sprang forward and started to slide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>When I reached the middle I went through to my neck in the cold water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Of course I sprang out as quickly as I went in, but I had to go on to school drenched to the skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Indeed, all my life it has been hard for me to resist a challenge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The year I began school my <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Rowland</foreName></persName> was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Just after he was old enough to accompany me the fearful excitement attending the settlement of the northeast boundary came to a head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>With other lads we ran from school to find the <rs>Leeds Company</rs> drilling with fifes and drums in <persName n="Millet,Mister,,,," id="n0173.0002.00011.00026" reg="nearbymention:Millet,Henry,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Millet</surname></persName>'s large front yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>On arriving we were delighted with the beautiful uniforms and bright plumes of the company and excited as boys always are by the music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>This was a new experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Our mother soon explained that father accepted the draft, but on account of his rheumatism would send a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Indeed, I never remember quarreling with him, but he was never cringing or slavish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>I have always believed it a providential circumstance that I had that early experience with a negro lad, for it relieved <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> me from that feeling of prejudice which would have hindered me from doing the work for the freedmen which, years afterwards, was committed to my charge.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>At a later period, seeing the moral and religious condition of this frontier, he began to give religious instruction to the adults as well as to the children, and was soon after ordained as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Baptist,,,,," id="n0173.0002.00013.00037" reg="mostcommon:Baptist,nomatch:0"><surname>Baptist</surname></persName> minister in that community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>He was still preaching in the meetinghouse before mentioned when my father and mother were young people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Through his influence and that of other ministers who followed him, a thriving church resulted, and the community of <placeName reg="Leeds, Leeds, England" key="tgn,7010442">Leeds</placeName>, far and near, became remarkable in its attention to religious matters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Into this atmosphere I was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The usual routine was to recite verses previously learned at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>My parents must have been very faithful in having me prepare my lessons, for I committed to memory a great deal of Scripture about that time that has'since been of great service to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We did not even have family prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Once during my father's illness I came from a prayer meeting at my uncle's house much impressed with a desire to be a Christian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>My father, sitting in his high-backed chair, asked me about the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>After telling him, I said, <quote>Father, do you ever pray</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>He was silent for a few moments and then said: <quote>My son, would you like to have me pray?</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>I said <quote>yes</quote> and we knelt together beside his chair and he repeated our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>'s Prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>This was the only time that I heard my father thus offer a petition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Toward the latter part of the course the students of my class, with <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> exceptions, were inclined to dissipation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Herein I discover something of the great benefit to a young man taking a classical course simply in this line of review and examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>I realize now the fidelity of our professors, and rejoice in the unfailing personal supervision which they gave to the work of every student under their charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Our studies went on to embrace the entire course of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>. No important department was neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Attention to chemistry, mineralogy, geology, and astronomy was abreast of that in any college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>I feel that I was too young and had too poor a preparation to receive all the benefit that was needful, or the help and discipline which came to many of my classmates who were older and more mature before entering college, but, after all, this classical training was for me in every way a good foundation for my subsequent professional life and for the various requirements of what followed in my career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Indeed, I count the great gain of a college course to be the impression made upon the character of a young man, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, by the professors, and then by daily intercourse with the students.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>He was quicktempered and at times irascible, and resented any attempted humor on the part of a pupil; but the lessons he gave were settled in his own mind, and the student could not well forget them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>His forte was chemistry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>His lectures to students, including the medical classes, were plain, clear, and beautiful, not at all behind the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Chemistry, geology, mineralogy, and astronomy could not be pursued as now with the new splendid opportunities for individual experiments, but in these subjects the venerable professor made ours the equal of any existing college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>No student would willingly receive a reprimand from him. His looks with a few words were enough for a delinquent lad. Though he was a great scholar and indeed a manly man, yet he had, it was said, a peculiar weakness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>During the freshman year a young man had all the old trials in the way of hazing; holdings &mdash; in at the chapel; football miscarriages; smokings-out; baths at the pump; casting the remains of nightly feasts into his room and such like performances, that some sophomores, <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> aided by other fun-loving boys from the higher classes, could give him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>As I think of my college course, and in fact of all my school life, I see that I had in mind very clearly defined <num value="1">one</num> purpose, and that was to accomplish what I undertook in spite of the obstacles thrown in my way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>I may here say that this little <hi rend="italics">contretemps</hi> eventuated in a lifelong relationship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>After this my purpose to do well, to accomplish what I undertook, and to make a success of life never faltered.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The next winter I was able to get a school in the district where I was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The following winter I had a large district school in East Livermore and received for my hard work <measure n="18dollars" type="currency">$18</measure> per month, and part of the time I had the very pleasant experience of <quote>boarding round.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Of course, the master, during his week with a family, always had the very best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>After a month, however, I was relieved from the wear and tear of it by an aged widow who found me so useful and companionable that she requested the privilege of boarding the master at her house.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>This was the most difficult and trying of all my experiences in school-teaching, owing to the school being composed of boys and girls of all ages from <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> to twentyone and without any proper classification, and further, owing to the fact that I had previously been a <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> scholar in the same school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>I managed, however, to get through the winter without any serious difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>There were threatenings from some of the young men who felt sure that they could <quote>put the master out</quote> in a contest of strength, and there was at times a troublesome independence on the part of some of the larger girls who had known me as their companion in social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>It was not long before I reported to <persName n="Williams,Captain,Seth,,," id="n0173.0005.00046.00142" reg="default:Williams,Seth,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Seth</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>, then adjutant of the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>He, too, was very pleasant and thoughtful for me. He was always a genial gentleman and took pleasure in doing something for the comfort of anybody who came in contact with him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>The superintendent, <persName n="Brewerton,Captain,,,," id="n0173.0005.00046.00143" reg="mostcommon:Brewerton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brewerton</surname></persName>, was a tall military man dressed in the uniform of the corps of engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Every officer at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> was in uniform, and every cadet also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The cadet's dress consisted of the well-known gray coat, with the tail so short you might call it a coatee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>It was doublebreasted, with <num value="3">three</num> rows of bell buttons and a stiff collar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>During the encampment, and for some time after, the trousers were of white duck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>When off duty the cadet, outside of his quarters, wore a small cap of blue cloth, diminishing toward the top, which was flat and round, and having a chin strap with a brass button at each extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>The cap was essentially like the ordinary undress cap of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>When on duty, at that time, the cadet wore a singular stiff felt hat shaped like a section of stovepipe with a leather band around it at the bottom, and a band at the top. It was finished with a stiff visor, and pompon at the crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Each hat was ornamented in front with a handsome bronze castle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Cadet-Officer">cadet officers</rs>, instead of a pompon, wore a plume of dark feathers which floated in the breeze and covered the top of the hat. The waist belt was of white canvas with a brass breastplate, and the shoulder belt, which sustained the cartridge box, was also of the same material.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>As I looked upon the battalion for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> when in line of battle in <num value="2">two</num> ranks, I thought I had never seen anything handsomer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>There did not appear to be a motion throughout the line, and later, the movement in column presented an appearance even more beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>Every cadet held his musket in his left hand, and the drill in the manual of arms was nearly perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Though the motions were angular and stiff enough, the effect upon the beholder was that of a complete machine which could make no failure as long as it was in order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>When the cadets were at drill or on parade there was, not far off, a squad of young men dressed in old clothes of different descriptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>They all had caps, but caps differing from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>This squad afforded interest and amusement to a number of visitors who clustered about the encampment to observe the drills and parades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>I was very soon attached to that squad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>At drill we were divided into <num value="2">two</num> such squads and each was under the command of a cadet corporal of the class above us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>They called us <quote>Septs</quote> because we came in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>The officers said we were <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> cadets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The main portion of my class, <num value="102">102</num> in number, had reported for duty before <dateStruct value="-06-1"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="1">1st</day></dateStruct>, and so had had the benefit of the summer encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It really meant a constant drill and discipline, covering the whole new life of a young man, every day and every hour, from which he was never for a moment relieved, even at night; because with only blankets and a single pillow he was obliged to lie upon the hard floor of his tent and be subject to annoyance, he knew not when &mdash; to be plagued by the other cadets &mdash; some of whom would pull him out of his bed or otherwise attempt to haze him. I escaped this severe trial because I slept in the encampment <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> only <num value="4">four</num> nights; then the battalion was sent to the barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Still our squad drill continued once a day while the uniforms of the <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> cadets were in making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>The corporal of <num value="1">one</num> of our squads was <persName n="Boggs,Cadet,,,," id="n0173.0005.00048.00144" reg="nearbymention:Boggs,W.,R.,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <surname>Boggs</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>Ite was a capital drill master, severe enough, but always dignified and respectful to the boys under his charge; but the other corporal, <persName n="Walker,Cadet,,,," id="n0173.0005.00048.00145" reg="mostcommon:Walker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName>, never let an opportunity slip for an irritating speech to the squad and to individuals in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>It was hard enough for a young man to put himself into what was called the military attitude, the little fingers on the seams of the trousers, palms to the front, head drawn back, and shoulders squared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>I held myself in this position of apparent awkwardness till it became natural to be thus set up. I think the most difficult thing for each of us was to so walk as to strike the ball of the foot <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>To point the toe and do this were required, and it gave a cadet a peculiar gait.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>As soon as I received my uniform, my coat neatly fitting and keeping me in shape, with a clean white linen collar turned over the stiff binding, and trousers like my comrades, it was easier than before to escape expressions of amusement, and when we were divided into sections and sent to the class rooms I became daily more and more reconciled to the new life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>In the recitation room I was more ready to compete with my companions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the young men of my class when getting acquainted with each other were reasonably harmonious in their social life, but I very soon found that unpleasant feuds existed in the corps of cadets, and, as a rule, the subject of slavery was at the bottom of the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>I would not have owned at that time that I <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> was an abolitionist, but in sentiment I indorsed the speeches of <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n0173.0005.00049.00146" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, which were against slavery and demonstrated the desirability of its nonextension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>However, I said but little about politics, yet once in a while in conversation with a companion I did let my sentiments be known.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>When we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> went into quarters the room to which I was assigned was in what was called the <rs type="place">Old South Barracks</rs>, a very large room without alcoves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>There were <num value="4">four</num> separate iron bedsteads and <num value="4">four</num> iron tables, with other meager furniture for <num value="4">four</num> cadets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>No young men were ever more studious or more desirous to get a fair standing in the institution than we.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>The only single room on the same floor had been at <num value="1">one</num> time used as a <quote>light prison,</quote> and this room was occupied by a cadet of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class by the name of <persName n="Otis,,Elmer,S.,," id="n0173.0005.00049.00150" reg="expanded:Otis,Elmer,Stanchfield,,"><foreName>Elmer</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Otis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>He had done some foolish thing while in the camp which the majority of his class condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>There was no criminality in it, but his comrades declared that no gentleman would do such a thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>A few of them started the cry to ostracize him, or, as the cadets say, <quote>cut him.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The idea went from man to man till there was scarcely a cadet who would speak to him. I remember <num value="2">two</num> of his classmates who were exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>They occasionally visited him. As he had my mother's maiden name, my attention was early called to him and his situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Frequently I stepped in to see him, and <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> sometimes during leisure hours played checkers with him to relieve his loneliness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The next day after my arrival at the post I went to the engineer's barracks situated near the northwest corner of the reservation to look up <persName n="Lothrop,,Warren,,," id="n0173.0005.00050.00153" reg="default:Lothrop,Warren,,,"><foreName>Warren</foreName> <surname>Lothrop</surname></persName> from my home town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>He was now a magnificentlooking man, straight, tall, and of fine figure, and his officers were proud of him and trusted him fully in the management of the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>He was earnestly seeking a commission, and his friends thought he had a good prospect of receiving <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>As he was a worthy man and the son of my guardian, and as our families at home were intimate, I felt it a duty and a privilege to visit him. For a time he came to see me during release from quarters, always making short calls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/><num value="1">One</num> <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, when the limits of cadets were extended to embrace the public lands generally, I went to the engineer barracks to make a call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>For a time I was very intimate with <num value="1">one</num> of my classmates from the <rs>East</rs>, and finding him a man of high culture, I constantly sought his companionship, as he did mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>A few months had passed when I began to feel that there was something in the social atmosphere <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> of my class unfavorable to me. I need not go into details, but simply state that a few individuals with a view to promoting the interest of a rival in academic standing, formed a cabal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>They were all of them Southern men. It was the beginning of a feud such as I had observed in other classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Against me certain things were alleged: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, that I was an abolitionist; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that I associated with <quote>cut men</quote> ; <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, that I visited and made companions of enlisted men; and <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, that I had joined the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> class and curried favor with the professor of ethics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>I now saw that individuals who belonged to the small conspiracy passed me without recognition or took some other method of showing that my society was not desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>I became suspicious and turned a cold shoulder upon any classmate who might pass me by without notice, even when done by accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>My friend and associate, of whom I have spoken, changed his place in ranks to remove from me, and completely withdrew his fellowship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>For this I called him to account with indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>On the <name>Sabbath</name> the professor of ethics, who was also the chaplain, preached a sermon against slander and ostracism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The case fitted so well that my late friend asked of me an interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>We had a walk and talked over the whole matter, when he told me frankly that he wanted to stand high in the academy, not only in his studies but socially, and as he saw that I was becoming unpopular for the reasons I have alleged, he thought it would be better for him completely to forego my companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>In a proud spirit I agreed to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Our dwelling was called <quote>The <address><street n="Elm street">Elm</street></address> cottage.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>It was a story and <num value="0.5">a half</num> house with tiny rooms, in which we made ourselves very comfortable, having escaped from the closer confinement of the hotel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>The front hall of this cottage was just <measure n="1yard" type="distance">one yard</measure> square.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>At the time I came to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> I was exceedingly desirous to help the chaplain, <persName n="French,Professor,,,," id="n0173.0008.00091.00340" reg="nearbymention:French,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>French</surname></persName>, in any way I could, and to open up more general religious privileges to the cadets, to the soldiers, and to the families in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>I had it in mind then that I should soon leave the army and enter the <rs>Christian</rs> ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>This caused me to use all my leisure time in systematic study of a religious nature, in fact, my reading took that direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Very early, with the permission of the commandant and the chaplain, I opened with a few cadets a social <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> meeting for prayer and conference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting was in a room in what was called the <quote>Angle</quote> of the new barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>Only <num value="5">five</num> cadets came to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting, though the invitation had been quite extensively circulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>All the meetings were held during recreation hours, just after the cadets' supper.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>The attendance kept increasing, while the meetings were held at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> twice a week, till our room was filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>Many of the young men who attended this gained later a national distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>Among them was <persName n="Upton,Cadet,Emory,,," id="n0173.0008.00092.00342" reg="default:Upton,Emory,,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <foreName>Emory</foreName> <surname>Upton</surname></persName>, who, after he had attained the rank of brigadier general, was for a few years the superintendent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>He then made a change, allowing the young men to have their meetings on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> evenings in the dialectic hall of the academy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>Instead of being confined to <num value="0.5">a half</num>-hour's service, they were permitted to remain together until tattoo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>This was a great privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>Later the <orgName n="Young Men's Christian Association" type="association">Young Men's Christian Association</orgName> was formed and took charge of the meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>Nearly the whole corps of cadets are now members of this association, and the meetings have been continued without interruption for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>Our commandant in <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Hardee,Lieutenant-Colonel,William,J.,," id="n0173.0008.00092.00343" reg="default:Hardee,William,J.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>, had a family of <num value="2">two</num> daughters and <num value="1">one</num> son. <num value="1">One</num> day <persName n="Hardee,Colonel,,,," id="n0173.0008.00092.00344" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,William,J.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName> and myself had a long walk together beyond the limits of our reservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>He had previously expressed a desire that I should teach his children and allow him to compensate me privately for it. At that time the officers had no private school for their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>I consented to do this, and so began an intimacy with the family that was <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> only interrupted by <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n0173.0008.00093.00345" reg="nearbymention:Hardee,William,J.,,"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s relief from duty before the end of my term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>He declared that he was fond of the <rs>Union</rs>, but he had made up his mind that there would be <num value="2">two</num> governments, and as he was from the extreme <rs>South</rs>, he told me that he could not bear the thought of belonging to a Northern confederacy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>I took up the <name>Hebrew</name> language and recited with some regularity to an Episcopal clergyman near <placeName reg="Highland Falls, Orange, New York" key="tgn,2069702">Highland Falls</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>He was a scholarly man and interested himself greatly in my progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Lectures, in connection with Bible study, I delivered habitually once a week in what we called <quote>the little church under the hill.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>This church where the soldiers' families attended was so arranged that a partition separated the altar and all that belonged to it from the main room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>This enabled the <name>Catholics</name> to have their services in the morning, when the partition doors were opened, and the other people in the afternoon and evening, when the doors were closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Here we had, every Sabbath for nearly <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, a thriving <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday school</orgName>, of which I was the superintendent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>In this active <name>Christian</name> work, cadets, the chaplain's daughters, and other ladies of the post assisted regularly with the music and as teachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Usually in the evening we had a Methodist clergyman to preach and conduct the services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>Sometimes our chaplain, who was an Episcopalian, would give an address, and sometimes the clergy of other denominations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>I always endeavored to do something in addition to what my military duties proper and the preparation for them required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>It may be said that this was not a fair preparation for what might be required of me sooner or later in the army proper; but I do not think so. This training to which I subjected myself enlarged <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> my sympathies and acquaintanceship and was, indeed, a stepping-stone to all that followed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/><num value="1">One</num> thing that troubled me was a class distinction, which seemed too intense for our republican ideas, and, indeed, made the army itself disliked by the people at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>I gave much reflection to the subject of discipline and came to fully believe that it was possible to have a higher grade for our enlisted men and a better system of government by officers, especially by those of high rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>While considering this subject in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct> I wrote an article entitled <quote>Discipline in the army.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>There I advocated with as much force as I could a paternal system over against the martinet system in vogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>I endeavored to show that the general who cared for his men as a father cares for his children, providing for all their wants and doing everything he could for their comfort consistent with their strict performance of duty, would be the most successful; that his men would love him; would follow him readily and be willing even to sacrifice their lives while enabling him to accomplish a great patriotic purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>Indeed, I am now glad that my mind took that turn, for I never met a soldier who served with me in the great war who does not now come to me with an expression of appreciation and fellowship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>Others, doubtless, have had similar experiences, but I know that during the <rs>Civil War</rs> the general who loved and cared for his men and diligently showed this disposition to all under his command, won good will and affection above all other commanders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>My article, published in a New York monthly, caused quite a commotion at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, at the time, among the <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> officers stationed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Even the superintendent was annoyed because he <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> thought that I reflected upon his management of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>Some agreed with my sentiments, but the majority said that they were contrary to a proper military spirit.</p>
