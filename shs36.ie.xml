<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Such was the programme marked out by the South-haters in both houses of the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Fortunately they were prevented from carrying out their nefarious and murderous schemes by several circumstances which may well be considered providential interventions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was the declaration by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0294.0002.00001.00004" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> that no policy of violence and outrage could be perpetrated upon the <rs type="role" reg="military-Officer">military officers</rs> and soldiers who had laid down their arms and surrendered to him as long as the prisoners regarded their paroles and kept faith upon which they had ceased fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0294.0002.00001.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was at that time universally popular, and so complete was his hold upon the regard of the people that nothing could be done towards persecuting the surrendered Southern Soldiers contrary to his will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Another circumstance which also contributed to save the <rs>Southern</rs> people from wholesale massacre and confiscation was <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> the fact that <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0294.0002.00002.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, just before his tragic and to the <rs>South</rs> most calamitous death, had begun to put in operation a plan to rehabilitate and restore to their places in the <rs>Union</rs> the several Southern States, and after his death the task was recommenced by his successor, <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0294.0002.00002.00007" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Whatever might have been the disposition of the <rs>Northern</rs> politicians toward <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0294.0002.00002.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s movements for Southern reinstatement, when it was undertaken by <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0294.0002.00002.00009" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, it created such a state of fury and hate that his impeachment and expulsion from office was immediately attempted by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In a trial of impeachment a committee from the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> makes the accusations, while the <name>Senate</name> sitting as a court under the presidency of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs>, hears the evidence and votes upon the guilt or innocence of the accused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote is required to convict, and in this case <num value="1">one</num> vote was lacking to secure conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Thus, by the narrowest possible margin <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0294.0002.00002.00010" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> escaped impeachment, and he constantly stood as a stern and unflinching opposer of all the radical schemes attempted by Congress against the <rs>Southern States</rs> and people, so that although he could not prevent the legislation that imposed the infamous Reconstruction measures upon the <rs>South</rs>, he was able at least to prevent the wholesale enslavement of the white people of the <rs>South</rs> and the plunder of their property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Being unable to wreak their hate in mass upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people there still remained the possibility of resorting to individual outrages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><num value="1">One</num> of these expedients was to try <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0294.0002.00002.00011" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> for treason and to condemn him to death and execute him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The books written by other Union soldiers who were prisoners in the <rs>South</rs> teem with accounts of brutality, insults, and suffering heaped upon them by Rebel officers and guards seemingly for cruelty's sake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I cannot question the veracity of those Northern writers; but I can and will speak for myself as far as I was concerned and as to my experience and as to what came under my observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>With all due respect to my late brethren-in-arms and in prison life, I cannot but think that to some extent they were instrumental, if they state facts, in bringing it upon themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The camp was situated on what had been heavy pine timber land, but the trees had been cut down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>There was a stream of clear water running east through the prison grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The stockade was built of pine logs cut <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> long and hewed to the thickness of <num value="1">one</num> foot and set in a trench <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> deep, making a wall <num value="15">fifteen</num> high, on the top of which were sentry boxes about <measure n="35feet" type="distance">thirty-five feet</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The stockade was not quite completed when we arrived there, but a strong force of men was at work at it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We were guarded by the <orgName type="regiment" key="25ALInfantry">Twenty-fifth Alabama Infantry</orgName>, veteran troops, who knew how to treat prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>And I said then and have ever since said in speaking of our guards&mdash;the <orgName type="regiment" key="25ALInfantry">Twenty-fifth Alabama Infantry</orgName>&mdash;that I never met the same number of <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> men together who came much nearer to my standard of what I call gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The fact is, as a general proposition, we showed humanity, and though we could not provide for the prisoners as well as we would have wished to do, we did the best we could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>Slavery was a curse as well as a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>It was a curse because it was the instrumentality of so many of our young men, who could not compete with slave labor, forsaking their homes&mdash;expatriating themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>The passions and prejudices existing before the strife and engendered by the war, have cooled and are fast disappearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>Social, business intercourse, personal contact, the exhibition of heroic courage and fortitude on many a well-contested battlefield has evoked mutual admiration and respect and have dissipated these conflicting elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>My own opinion has always been that his reckless bravery led to his untimely death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>I suppose there are reports in the proper archives, both Federal and Confederate, of this action of <placeName reg="Yellow Tavern, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2115162">Yellow Tavern</placeName> and of the movement of troops preliminary to it, but I know nothing of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>I state what came under my observation and hearing as a soldier in the ranks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>It was not at the beginning of the <rs>Wilderness</rs> campaign that the movement of the cavalry culminating at <placeName reg="Yellow Tavern, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2115162">Yellow Tavern</placeName> took place, but in the campaign more than a year later (<dateStruct value="1864-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>), in which the terrible battle near <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Courthouse">Spotsylvania Courthouse</placeName> was fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>It was the current talk of our army that that conflict was by far the most desperate of the war. I have heard our men say that so near did the <rs>Yankees</rs> come that they could look into their eyes and even club them with the butts of their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>It was in this battle that trees were torn and cut through and fell from the steady hail of minie bullets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/><pb id="p.122" n="122"/> So desperately did <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01071" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s men press their assaults that, as the gossip in our army was, a portion of our line faltered and was giving way when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01072" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> himself rode up, but his men made him go to the rear with cries of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01073" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> to the rear!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>and they soon drove the enemy off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>The morning following this desperate battle and repulse of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01074" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:2"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, our cavalry, which had been only partially engaged, was put in motion and headed south toward <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>We in the ranks did not know what for, but as we became extended on the way south word came along the line that the <rs>Yankee</rs> cavalry had been despatched on a raid to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, that city being, as it was supposed, but weakly defended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>We were to follow up the <rs>Yankees</rs> and put them out of business before they got to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I will say here, to dispel any idea that we were worn down by <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01075" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s troops, <q direct="unspecified">hanging on us like a troop of wolves,</q> that <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01076" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> was at that time in the best of condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>We were well clothed, well fed and well mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>For many of our horses we were indebted to our friends the enemy, to whom we looked when in need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>I myself was then on my <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> mount derived from that source.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>I remember this march after <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01077" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> as a very pleasant <num value="1">one</num>, our only fear being that he would get away, as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>That we would not whip him if we caught up with him did not enter our minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>I remember that we pressed the rear so closely that in <placeName reg="Louisa, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002170">Louisa county</placeName> we came on a detachment of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>I being in the leading column joined in the pursuit with visions of a fresh mount; but alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>there were others who wanted those horses more than I did, and they were soon appropriated, while their riders were sent to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>As I remember, the enemy's cavalrymen were an insignificant looking set of men, but their horses and equipment were excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>I would like to emphasize a fact not sufficiently dwelt on by the <rs>Southern</rs> historian: that is, the contempt in which <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0294.0013.00122.01078" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s men held the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalrymen and the great respect the <name>Southerners</name> had for the horses and equipment of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>Our command neared <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and soon we knew from the booming of cannon that an engagement had begun between the <num value="2">two</num> cavalry forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>Now, as to this engagement, I can say <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> little, because I saw little of it. When a soldier from the ranks undertakes to tell about a battle extending over a mile or <num value="2">two</num> in wooded country you can set him down as a man <q direct="unspecified">talking through his hat.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>I did see a battery or <num value="2">two</num> or ours located on a hilltop firing away, and did see squadrons of our cavalry moving forward near those batteries, but I saw none of our forces retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>When our regiment reached the field the squadron to which I was attached was ordered to dismount and to deploy as sharpshooters, which we did, <num value="100">one hundred</num> or more of us scattering along the edge of a wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>I heard rifle firing to the right and left and in front; this firing did not approach our position, but rather receded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>What the dispositions of the forces severally were I never knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>What I did see, after being in the position say <num value="20">twenty</num> or <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure>, was a solitary horseman approaching us through the thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>He was riding slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>We soon knew from his black plume that it was our general, and the exclamation came from <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> of us: <q direct="unspecified">That is <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n0294.0013.00123.01079" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and he is wounded.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1557"/>As he rode slowly toward us we of course rushed up to him. It was but too true; he was wounded, and mortally, as we knew when we saw where the bullet had entered his side and torn his gray jacket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>He spoke not a word nor uttered a groan as we assisted him from his horse to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>He was borne away on a stretcher or blanket, I forget which, some of the more stalwart of my company doing that duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>The battle was over; in fact, so far as I could see or hear, it was not much of a battle anyhow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/>Of course, as soon as the <rs>Federal</rs> command realized that we had caught up with him his raid was at an end.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2741"/> 
<text><body> 
<p>The following story was related by the chief actor long after the war was over, in almost these words:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>It was on a cold, gray morning that we started on that trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>I was exempt from service on account of age, but the <rs>Yankees</rs> were pouring into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and making raids into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, sweeping the whole country as they went, carrying off horses, destroying grain and cattle, and killing the planters on the slightest provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>I had <num value="11">eleven</num> fine horses, and knowing my life as well as property was in jeopardy, I determined to attempt to get them to a place of safety if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>We went through byways and woodlands as much as we could, thereby meeting few persons, and these, like ourselves, fleeing from the <rs>Yankees</rs> and carrying with them their most valuable effects.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>The same eager question was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> asked by all: <q direct="unspecified">Where are the <rs>Yankees</rs>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>It was the <num value="1">one</num> absorbing thought of all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2748"/>I rode my saddle mare, <persName><foreName>Fannie</foreName></persName>, and Black <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> rode Gray Charlie and led the children's pet pony, Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>The other negroes took care of the remaining <num value="8">eight</num> horses, carrying with them our supplies for camping.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>My equipments were in all respects <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>I was especially proud of a fine pair of holsters and army pistols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>A snowstorm blew up about noon, and it was cold and tiresome riding, but about sundown we were at the foot of <placeName reg="White Top Mountain, Idaho, Idaho" key="tgn,2767527">White Top mountain</placeName>, and near the home of <num value="2">two</num> widow-ladies, from whom I got provisions for the negroes and bedroom for myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>Leaving my saddle-bags, blanket, etc., in the house, I went out to superintend the boys as they fed and got supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>It did not take long to get a big fire started, and the bacon and corn bread were soon cooking, for our long, cold ride had given us good appetites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>I had carried with me some roasted rye, that was used to make coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>I was lying back on a high pile of wood that broke the wind off of us, when the boy <rs>Jim</rs> ran up before me, <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> his teeth chattering, and pale with fright, as he cried: <q direct="unspecified">Marsa, de Yankees done got us.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/></p> 
<p>I sprang to my feet, and at the same instant a heavy hand was laid on my shoulder and a pistol thrust into my face, while the terrible words, <q direct="unspecified">You are my prisoner,</q> fell on my ear like a death sentence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>We were literally surrounded by the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>Guards were immediately put over us and the premises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>I was allowed to go into the house at night, but I tell you I did not sleep much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>If <num value="1">one</num> of those guards had left the back door of that house I would have taken French leave in a hurry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>Before they went into camp for the night <num value="1">one</num> burly officer came up and took my gold watch from my pocket, turned it over and over, opened the lids, and examined the works, and then, very unexpectedly, put it back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>He turned up the cape of my heavy army overcoat, commented on the quality very emphatically, looked at my new cavalry boots, asked the number of them, and chuckling to himself, finished his inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>I knew very well that in the morning I would be stripped of my outfit and given some filthy old rags, so I determined to get away from them, for besides my watch and clothes I had several <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure> in a belt around my waist.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>At daybreak we were called up. My boys cooked the breakfast, but were watched too closely to exchange a word with me. Having finished the meal the order was given to bring around the horses, and the guard was called from the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>Now was my chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>Requesting permission to get my blanket and saddle-bags from the house, I entered just as the guard was disappearing from the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>Snatching my baggage, I made a bee line through the back door, across the yard, and escaping notice in the confusion of the moment, I managed to get the stable between me and the troop, and succeeded in getting to a thicket of scrub pine, where, dropping behind a dead log, I lay in the snow until nearly <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>Feeling sure the coast was clear, I crawled out and worked my way up the mountain and found a sheltered place where the snow was so thin I could kick it off with my boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>Here I tramped all night to keep from freezing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>I was almost famished, and when day dawned tried to make my way to a cabin near the <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> foot of the mountain, hoping to be able to get something to eat. I kept close to the bushes, however, until I was abreast of the cabin, and after watching for some time I was convinced that there would be no danger in making my request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>There was no <num value="1">one</num> in the house but an old woman and <num value="2">two</num> young girls, and they soon had a substantial meal before me and informed me that the <rs>Yankees</rs> had gone north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>I paid for my breakfast, and feeling vastly more comfortable, began my walk home&mdash;a distance, I was sure, of at least <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure>. But luck favored me. I had not gone more than <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> when, following a footpath through the fields, I saw <num value="1">one</num> of my boys going down the main road on old <persName><foreName>Charley</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>I called, and <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName> was the gladdest boy you ever saw. He was asleep on the horse's back and had neither saddle nor bridle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>He had slipped away in the night and the horse had instinctively taken the road home, with the sleeping negro on his back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>I got a scrap of rope for a halter and begged an old piece of carpet, after which I mounted, taking <persName><foreName>Dave</foreName></persName> up behind me, I was not afraid to stay in the roadway now, and when we were within <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> of home</placeName> everybody knew us and I was obliged to tell time and again the story of my capture and escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>The old women would cry and wonder where their boys were, and ask eagerly if I had seen any traces of them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>The realities were too numerous and, exciting to be enlarged upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>I love them all too much for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>They were all brave soldiers, and would go wherever ordered; but I often observed during the war that where the danger was great and little could be accomplished the officer in command would call for volunteers, thereby leaving it to the soldier to perform the duty as he best saw how.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3596"/>On the outside of our enclosure stood the fort, officers' houses, hospital, and other buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3597"/>However, we were never allowed to go out, except now and then in small details to load or unload a vessel (a service I had never been called upon to do). On the way from our barracks to the wharf was a gate in the wall, about <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> wide, through which all communications were carried on.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3598"/>Of course, among so many (<num value="1500">1,500</num> or <num value="2000">2,000</num>) soldiers, there were some not entirely satisfied with the board and lodging furnished, and so soon as they were assured that there was no hope of being exchanged began to concept plans of escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3604"/>To do this we must pass the gate and make our exit from the <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> side of the island, thus going directly from home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3605"/><pb id="p.273" n="273"/></p> 
<p>So on the morning of the day mentioned we walked up to the gate and passed out, treating the guard with perfect contempt, and not deigning so much as to look at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/>They were thus thrown off their guard, thinking, of course, no <num value="1">one</num> would attempt such a thing without authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3607"/>Once out of the pert we met a good many, strolling around the island, some of then our own men who had taken the oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3608"/>So we attracted no attention while making a survey of the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3609"/>We could find no boat to leave on that night, hence we selected a ladder made of scantling about <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> long, at an officer's barn, and after making such other arrangements as were necessary we repassed the gate without any trouble, got a pot, boiled our clothes to get rid of the lice, for we knew we had a long tramp before us, and unless we got rid of the lice they would totally devour us before we reached our journey's end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>After getting out we hid in separate places till good dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>About <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> we met, as per agreement, at a little building being put up for a doctor's office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>We then secured our ladder and tied to it our shoes and a piece of plank, to be used as a paddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>Then came the most dangerous part but it only required bluff and impudence, besides a little nerve, and we were tolerably well supplied with the <num value="2">two</num> former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>But to pas a good sentinel, continually walking his post, with his turning points not more than <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> apart, laden with the old ladder, and approaching him at almost right angles on a bright star&mdash;lit night, in a perfectly open place&mdash;not even a shrub or bunch of grass to hide us&mdash;was the cleverest work I ever did.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>But I should have before explained that there was, and perhaps is yet, a levee thrown up around the island, I guess for the purpose of keeping off tidewater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>This was <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> high, and in getting the dirt to make the levee a canal about <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> wide and about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> deep was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>Thus, we had to cross this canal to pass the guard on the levee.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>Having arranged everything, we selected our man to slip, and after carefully getting his turning points, or the ends of hi., <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> beat, we proceeded to slip on him, as he went from us, at an angle of about <num value="30">thirty</num> degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>Just before he made the turning point we lay flat on the ground till he made the round and started back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>Proceeding in this way for about <num value="1">one</num> hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, we at last made the distance of about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">150 yards</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>Just as we feared, it failed to bear us up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>Action under such circumstances enhances the courage of men; inaction weakens it. Then it is that thoughtful men engage in introspection and sit in judgment upon their past lives.
