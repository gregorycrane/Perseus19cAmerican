<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I, nevertheless, adhered to my decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This aspect of affairs-our pay being only about <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">sixty dollars</measure> a monthcompelled us to hold consultation with our brother officers and to adopt the only alternative: to proceed on foot to whatever quarters we desired to occupy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>After having been stationed a short period at <placeName reg="Benicia Barracks">Benicia Barracks</placeName>, I was directed to report for duty to <persName n="Judah,Captain,,,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00007" reg="mostcommon:Judah,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Judah</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7017496" n="1.000 2" reg="chattanooga, hamilton, tennessee">Fort Jones</placeName>, <placeName reg="Scotts Valley, Stevens, Washington" key="tgn,2649495">Scott's Valley</placeName>, in the northern portion of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>. <persName n="Buchanan,Colonel,,,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00008" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was in command of my regiment, with <persName n="Grant,Captain,U.,S.,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00009" reg="default:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> as <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster">Quarter Master</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Although he completed his course at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> a year before I graduated, his purse was not much longer than my own; it became therefore necessary for us to devise some plan to get along in this country of gold and extravagance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We concluded to associate ourselves with <persName n="Sorrell,Doctor,,,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00011" reg="mostcommon:Sorrell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Doctor</roleName> <surname>Sorrell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bonnycastle,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00012" reg="mostcommon:Bonnycastle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Bonnycastle</surname></persName> in the organization of a mess, and, as we were fond of hunting and game was plentiful, to supply our own table with every variety thereof and to send the surplus to market for sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This financial policy worked admirably, and since I had at the age of <num value="15">fifteen</num>, during the absence of my father in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, taken charge of his farm for <num value="1">one</num> year with considerable success, <persName n="Crook,,,,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00013" reg="nearbymention:Crook,George,,,"><surname>Crook</surname></persName> and I were led to secure land and sow a large crop of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Just before the harvest, however, I was ordered in command of a detachment of Dragoons to serve as escort to <persName n="Williamson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0056.0001.00006.00014" reg="mostcommon:Williamson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> of the <rs type="role" reg="Topographical Engineer">Topographical Engineers</rs>, upon a surveying expedition in the direction of Salt <pb id="p.7" n="7"/><placeName reg="Lake City, Columbia, Florida" key="tgn,2020038">Lake</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At the former place I met, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, in his bank, <persName n="Sherman,,W.,T.,," id="n0056.0001.00007.00020" reg="default:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who possessed as at present the same piercing eye and nervous impulsive temperament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Little indeed did I anticipate at that period the great theatre of life upon which I was destined so soon to be thrown as an humble actor with him and others just mentioned, and who have since become so distinguished and prominent as American soldiers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In the early Autumn of <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> I sailed from <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName> for New York, via <placeName reg="Panama, Provincia de Panama, Panama" key="tgn,7006455">Panama</placeName>, and reported for duty at <placeName reg="Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Missouri" key="tgn,2059231">Jefferson Barracks, Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Soon thereafter, if my memory betray me not, I received a draft for about <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> in gold, as my share of the profit in the wheat crop cared for by <persName n="Crook,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0056.0001.00007.00021" reg="nearbymention:Crook,George,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Crook</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> I marched with my regiment to <placeName reg="Newcastle, Young, Texas" key="tgn,2106276">Fort Belknap, Texas</placeName>, which place we reached about the middle of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Shortly afterward, <placeName reg="Camp Cooper">Camp Cooper</placeName> was established on the <rs type="place">Clear Fork</rs> of the <rs>Brazos</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Thomas,Major,George,H.,," id="n0056.0001.00007.00022" reg="default:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was placed in command till the arrival of <persName n="Lee,Lieutenant-Colonel,R.,E.,," id="n0056.0001.00007.00023" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, to whom I had become very much attached at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> where he was Superintendent whilst I was a Cadet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>My relations and duties were therefore most pleasant during my service at <placeName reg="Camp Cooper">Camp Cooper</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The Government had under advisement, at this period, the construction of a fort in that vicinity; it was <persName n="Lee,Colonel,,,," id="n0056.0001.00007.00024" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s custom to often ride over the country in search of a suitable location, and to request each day <num value="1">one</num> or more of his officers to accompany him, in order to avail himself of their views in regard to the best point at which to establish this military post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Whilst riding with him upon <num value="1">one</num> of these excursions, and enjoying <pb id="p.8" n="8"/>the scenery and balmy air as we passed over the high and undulating prairies of that beautiful region, the conversation turned upon matrimony, when he said to me with all the earnestness of a parent: <quote>Never marry unless you can do so into a family which will enable your children to feel proud of both sides of the house.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He perhaps thought I might form an attachment for some of the country lasses, and therefore imparted to me his correct and at the same time aristocratic views in regard to this very important step in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>His uniform kindness to me whilst I was a Cadet, inclined me the more willingly to receive and remember this fatherly advice; and from these early relations <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sprang my affection and veneration which grew in strength to the end of his eventful career.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The latter part of that same year I was ordered to <placeName reg="Mason, Mason, Texas" key="tgn,2105944">Fort Mason</placeName>, situated near the <placeName key="tgn,1126288" n="1.000 10" reg="Llano, Texas, United States">Llano river</placeName>, about <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles distant</distance> from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Johnston,Colonel,Albert,Sidney,," id="n0056.0001.00008.00025" reg="default:Johnston,Albert,Sidney,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was chief in command until sent to <placeName reg="Utah, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Although stationed with him but a short time, I became deeply impressed by the exalted character of this extraordinary man. <persName n="Thomas,Major,George,H.,," id="n0056.0001.00008.00026" reg="default:Thomas,George,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> succeeded in authority; it was during my service as his <rs type="role" reg="Acting-Adjutant">Acting Adjutant</rs> that he specially won my high regard by his manliness and dignity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>After the lapse of several months, and having grown weary of the routine duties of camp life, I determined to change the scene and start on a scouting expedition in search of the red men of the forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Preparations were accordingly made, and I left <placeName reg="Mason, Mason, Texas" key="tgn,2105944">Fort Mason</placeName> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="1857-07-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1857</year>,</dateStruct> in command of <num value="25">twenty-five</num> men of Company <quote>G</quote> <orgName type="regiment" key="2Cav">Second Cavalry</orgName>, with an Indian guide, compass in hand and supplies for <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>. I passed out upon the plains by the head of the <placeName key="tgn,1126288" n="1.000 10" reg="Llano, Texas, United States">Llano river</placeName>, and marched thence to the country bordering on the <rs type="place">Concha rivers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>After an absence of <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> and an exploration of these different streams, I discovered an Indian trail, apparently about <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> old, and indications warranting the belief that <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> ponies belonged to the party <pb id="p.9" n="9"/>which was moving in the direction of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, via the head waters of Devil's river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I was young and buoyant in spirit; my men were well mounted and all eager for a chase as well as a fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was soon apparent that we would be forced to pass over a portion of the staked plains or desert lying between the <rs type="place">Concha rivers</rs> and <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; that in order to overtake the <name>Indians</name> we would most likely have great fatigue and privation to endure, as we could expect to find but little water during the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>However, in the conviction that we could live for a short time wherever Indians could subsist, we began the chase on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-07-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, marched about <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>, and camped that night upon the dry plains without water or the sight of game, so frequently in view the previous day, and without even the chirp of a bird to cheer us on our journey, we knew not exactly whither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>At early dawn the following morning the march was resumed; we passed during the day a water-hole utterly unfit for use, and went into bivouac that night with the same surroundings, fully <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure> further out in the desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Our canteens were now empty, and the outlook was somewhat dismal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>At daybreak on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">19th</day></dateStruct>, <quote>to horse</quote> was sounded and the journey continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>About noon a deer was seen bounding over the prairie, and with the sight went forth a shout of joy from the men, who then felt confident that fresh water was not very far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The trail had moreover become much more distinct; this encouragement, together with the hope of quenching their thirst, reinspirited the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>A few hours later another pool was reached, but not of that purity which was desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The odor of the water was such as to oblige <num value="1">one</num> to hold his breath whilst he partook of the distasteful but refreshing draught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The canteens were, notwithstanding, again filled, as well as the sleeves of all the waterproof coats we possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The pursuit was continued, and at dark we bivouacked after a forced march of probably <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>. Several of the horses began to show, by this time, great fatigue and leg-weariness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The following morning the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/>lofty peaks of the mountains near Devil's river could be seen afar off, and all possible speed was made as we recognized that the line between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> was not far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>About noon we reached another stagnant water-hole near the foot of a range of hills in proximity to the rugged and mountainous country about the head waters of Devil's river, along the banks of which stream passes the stage road from <placeName reg="San Antonio, Bexar, Texas" key="tgn,7014453">San Antonio</placeName> to <placeName reg="El Paso, El Paso, Texas" key="tgn,7013628">El Paso</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Here we discovered that another party of Indians had joined that of which we were in pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The deserted camp indicated that there were not less than <num value="50">fifty</num> warriors in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They had eaten <num value="1">one</num> of their mules or horses, and this sign, together with others about their bivouac, bore clear evidence that the party had become formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The trail from this point was not only much larger, but presented a fresher appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The arms of the men were therefore carefully inspected, every preparation made for action, and the chase quickly resumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The horses were much fatigued, and some of them were scarcely able to keep their places in the line of march; consequently the pursuit was not as rapid as it had been the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The march over the hills and up the mountains increased moreover their legweariness to such extent that about <time value="3pm">3 p. m.</time> I abandoned all hope of overtaking the <name>Indians</name> before they crossed the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, which river was then not far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>This condition of the horses and the thirst of the soldiers led me to the determination to quit the trail and go immediately in search of fresh water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We were at this time well up on the high and rough range of mountains bordering on Devil's river, and after leaving the trail a distance of nigh <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>, I perceived on a parallel range about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> off a few <name>Indians</name> waving a large white flag apparently hoisted from a mound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Orders from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> had been issued before I left <placeName reg="Mason, Mason, Texas" key="tgn,2105944">Fort Mason</placeName>, notifying all <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I therefore became convinced that these <name>Indians</name> were either the <name>Tonkaways</name> or a hostile body endeavoring by an infamous ruse to throw me off my guard, to entrap and massacre my entire party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Notwithstanding the condition of the men and the horses, I determined to pass over upon the ridge occupied by the red men, move toward them, and ascertain the meaning of this demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I had at this time but <num value="17">seventeen</num> men for action, the remainder having halted in rear, owing to the inability of their horses to advance further without rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I moved across to the opposite ridge and, as a precautionary measure, formed line and marched forward in readiness to talk or fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Every man was armed with an Army rifle and a <num value="6">six</num>-shooter; a few of us had sabres and <num value="2">two</num> revolvers, whilst I was armed with a double barrel shot-gun loaded with buck shot, and <num value="2">two</num> Navy <num value="6">six</num>-shooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>As we passed over a mound about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> or <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure> from the <num value="1">one</num> occupied by friend or foe-we knew not which &mdash; the flag, seemingly a sheet, was still waving aloft and a few <name>Indians</name> were lounging about with every appearance of a party desirous of peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The ground in that vicinity was rough and partially covered with a growth of <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> bayonets which afforded a secure place of concealment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Feeling that in the event of an attack I had better chances of success mounted than dismounted, for the reason that my fighting force in the latter instance would have been lessened by the number of men required to hold and guard the horses in rear, and sharing the belief which generally prevailed in my regiment that <num value="20">twenty</num> well-armed soldiers should be able to successfully engage <num value="4">four</num> times their number of <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0056.0001.00011.00027" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, I continued to move forward slowly upon the immediate right of my line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>When we were within about <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> paces of the mound occupied by the <name>Indians</name>, <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> of them advanced towards us with the flag; suddenly they threw it to the ground and fired upon us. Simultaneously from a large heap of dry grass, weeds and leaves, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>burst forth, in our immediate front, a blaze of fire some <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> in height, and, with a furious yell, the warriors instantly rose up round about us, whilst others charged down the slope in our midst, even seizing some of our horses by the bridle reins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>At the same moment a mounted party attacked the left of our line with lances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Thus began a most desperate struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The warriors were all painted, stripped to the waist, with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>either horns or wreaths of feathers upon their heads; they bore shields for defence, and were armed with rifles, bows and arrows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The quick and sharp report of our rifles, the smoke and cracking noise of the fire, together with the great odds against us, the shouts of the soldiers and the yells of the <name>Indians</name>, betokened the deadly peril from which seemingly naught but a miracle could effect our deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Each man, after discharging his rifle, drew his revolver and used it with terrible effect as the warriors, in many instances, were within a few feet of the muzzle of our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Stubbornly did my brave men hold their ground; again and again they drove the enemy back to the edge and in rear of the burning mass of weeds in our front, when finally the <name>Indians</name> charged desperately and forced our line back a few paces in the centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Having discharged my shot-gun, I rode at once with revolver in hand to that point, rallied the soldiers, who again drove them back, whilst our horses, in some instances, were beaten over the head with shields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The contest was at such close quarters that a warrior bore off a rifle which had been used and hung by <num value="1">one</num> of the men upon his saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Meantime the <name>Indians</name> as quickly as they discharged their arms, handed them to their squaws, who ran to the rear, reloaded and returned them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>At this juncture I was pierced in the left hand with an arrow which passed through the reins and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> finger, pinning my hand to the bridle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I instantly broke the spear head and threw it aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Unmindful of the fact that the feathers could not pass through the wound, I pulled the arrow in the direction in which it had been shot, and was compelled finally in order to free myself of it to seize the feathered in lieu of the barbed end. <pb id="p.13" n="13"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Thus raged this hand to hand conflict until all our shots were expended, and it was found that owing to the restiveness of the horses we could not reload while mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>We then fell back about <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> and dismounted for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Soon afterward arose from beyond the burning heap <num value="1">one</num> continuous mourning howl, such as can alone come forth from the heart of the red man in deep distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>These sounds of sorrow revealed to me that we were in little danger of a renewal of the assault, and I was, I may in truth say, most thankful for the truce thus proclaimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/><num value="2">Two</num> of our men had been killed and <num value="4">four</num>, besides myself, severely wounded; we had also <num value="1">one</num> horse killed and several disabled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Had the combat been renewed I would have had, after leaving a guard with the horses, but <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> men to fight on foot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Nightfall was approaching; the <name>Indians</name> gathered up their dead and wounded, and moved off toward the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Our thirst, which was great at the beginning of the combat, had now become intense from excitement and loss of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>I therefore moved at once to Devil's river, where we bivouacked about <time value="10pm">10 p. m.</time>, and sent a messenger to <placeName reg="Camp Hudson">Camp Hudson</placeName> for supplies and medical aid.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Thus closed this terrible scene, and often since have I felt most grateful that our horses were so broken down, as but for their condition they would, doubtless, when beaten over the lead with shields, have become totally unmanageable, and have caused the massacre of my entire command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I attribute also our escape to the fact that the <name>Indians</name> did not have the self-possession to cut our bridle reins, which act would have proved fatal to us. We were nigh meeting a similar fate to that of the gallant <rs>Custer</rs> and his noble band.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I learned after the fight, through other Indians as well as through my guide, that the party which attacked us were Comanches and Lipans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The exact number of their killed we were unable to ascertain, owing chiefly to the cover afforded by the <rs>Spanish</rs> bayonets, but we were confident at the hour <pb id="p.14" n="14"/>that it amounted to not less than <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num>; we were equally certain that <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> were engaged against us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Our troops returned to the scene of action and buried the dead, as I had neither pick nor shovel at the time of the encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Moreover I could not have delayed thereafter for any purpose, on account of the extreme suffering of the men for want of water.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The comparatively small loss we sustained is strong evidence that our shots proved most destructive, and that the <name>Indians</name> labored <pb id="p.15" n="15"/>under an intense excitement which caused them generally to miss their mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>In front was a dense woods and ugly marsh, which totally concealed the enemy from us; but the terrible roar of artillery and musketry plainly revealed, however, that <num value="1000">thousands</num> and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of living souls were struggling in most deadly conflict for the mastery of that field, and I might say, almost under the shadow of the <rs>Capitol</rs> of the infant Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>My line was established, and moved forward, regiment by regiment, when I discovered, as the disposition of the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA18">Eighteenth Georgia</orgName> was completed, an open field a little to its right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Holding in reserve the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName>, I ordered the advance, and galloped into the open field or pasture, from which point I could see, at a distance of about <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure>, the position of the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>They were heavily entrenched upon the side of an elevated ridge running a little <name>west</name> and <name>south</name>, and extending to the vicinity of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>At the foot of the slope ran <placeName reg="Powhite Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2597131">Powhite creek</placeName>, which stream, together with the abatis in front of their works, constituted a formidable obstruction to our approach, whilst batteries, supported by masses of infantry, crowned the crest of the hill in rear, and long range guns were posted upon the south side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, in readiness to enfilade our advancing columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The ground from which I made these observations was, however, open the entire distance to their entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>In a moment I determined to advance from that point, to make a strenuous effort to pierce the enemy's fortifications, and, if possible, put him to flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>I therefore marched the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName> by the right flank into this open field, halted and dressed the line whilst under fire of the longrange guns, and gave positive instructions that no man should fire until I gave the order; for I knew full well that if the men were allowed to fire, they would halt to load, break the allignment, and, very likely, never reach the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>I moreover ordered them not only to keep together, but also in line, and announced to them that I would lead them in the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Forward march was sounded, and we moved at a rapid, <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>but not at a double-quick pace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Meantime, my regiments on the left had advanced some distance to the front through the wood and swamp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Onward we marched under a constantly increasing shower of shot and shell, whilst to our right could be seen some of our troops making their way to the rear, and others lying down beneath a galling fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Our ranks were thinned at almost every step forward, and proportionately to the growing fury of the storm of projectiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Soon we attained the crest of the bald ridge within about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Here was concentrated upon us, from batteries in front and flank, a fire of shell and canister, which ploughed through our ranks with deadly effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Already the gallant <persName n="Marshall,Colonel,,,," id="n0056.0002.00027.00095" reg="mostcommon:Marshall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName>, together with many other brave men, had fallen victims in this bloody onset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>At a quickened pace we continued to advance, without firing a shot, down the slope, over a body of our soldiers lying on the ground, to and across <placeName reg="Powhite Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2597131">Powhite creek</placeName>, when, amid the fearful roar of musketry and artillery, I gave the order to fix bayonets and charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>With a ringing shout we dashed up the steep hill, through the abatis, and over the breastworks, upon the very heads of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The Federals, panic-stricken, rushed precipitately to the rear upon the infantry in support of the artillery; suddenly the whole joined in the flight toward the valley beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>At this juncture some <num value="20">twenty</num> guns, stationed in rear of the <rs>Federal</rs> line on a hill to my left, opened fire upon the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName>, which changed front, and charged in their direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>I halted in an orchard beyond the works, and despatched every officer of my staff to the main portion of the brigade in the wood on the left, instructing them to bear the glad tidings that the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName> had pierced the enemy's line, and were moving in his rear, and to deliver orders to push forward with utmost haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>At the same moment I discovered a Federal brigade marching up the slope from the valley beyond, evidently with the purpose to re-establish the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>I ran back to the entrenchments, appealed to some of our troops, who, by <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>this time, had advanced to the breastworks, to come forward and drive off this small body of Federals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Meantime, the long line of blue and steel to the right and left wavered, and, finally, gave way, as the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA18">Eighteenth Georgia</orgName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName>, and <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s Legion gallantly moved forward from right to left, thus completing a grand left wheel of the brigade into the very heart of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Simultaneously with this movement burst forth a tumultuous shout of victory, which was taken up along the whole Confederate line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>I mounted my horse, rode forward, and found the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX4">Fourth Texas</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="GA18">Eighteenth Georgia</orgName> had <measure n="14" type="captured">captured fourteen</measure> pieces of artillery, whilst the <orgName type="regiment" key="TX5">Fifth Texas</orgName> had charge of a Federal regiment which had surrendered to it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>When the battle had ceased, I gave my attention at once and during the night &mdash; to the care of the wounded, as doctors, litter-bearers and ambulance drivers were without much experience at that early period of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>As I rode over the field, about <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> in the morning, amid the wounded whose touching appeals for water resounded on every side, a voice in the distance arose, calling me by my surname in tones of deep distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The field, where lay the dead and dying zouaves in their gay uniforms, amid the tall green grass, presented indeed a singular appearance, as I passed down the slope and across the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>I here sent orders to my troops to halt and adjust their allignment, and discovered, at the same time, upon a ridge a short distance <pb id="p.37" n="37"/>beyond, another battery together with large masses of <orgName n="Federal Infantry" type="infantry">Federal infantry</orgName> in the vicinity of the <rs type="place">Chinn House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The wood and undergrowth were dense, and nothing but a pig path seemed to lead in the direction in which I was ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Nevertheless, I conducted my troops obliquely by the right flank, and while I advanced I could hear the shouts of the <rs>Federals</rs>, as they swept down the mountain upon our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>We marched on through the wood as rapidly as the obstacles in our passage would admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>They obeyed promptly, with a genuine Confederate yell, and the <rs>Federals</rs> were driven back pell mell, over and beyond the mountain, at a much quicker pace than they had descended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Night closed in with not only our dead and wounded, together with those of our adversary in our possession, but with the mountain, on the right, within our lines.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>My troops, at this period, were sorely in need of shoes, clothing and food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>We had had issued to us no meat for several days, and little or no bread; the men had been forced to subsist principally on green corn and green apples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>We opened fire, and a spirited action ensued, which lasted till a late hour in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>When the firing had in a great measure ceased, we were so close to the enemy that we could distinctly hear him massing his heavy bodies in our immediate front.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The extreme suffering of my troops for want of food induced me to ride back to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0056.0002.00042.00207" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and request him to send <num value="2">two</num> or more brigades to our relief, at least for the night, in order that the soldiers might have a chance to cook their meagre rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>He said that he would cheerfully do so, but he knew of no command which could be spared for the purpose; he, however, suggested I should see <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0056.0002.00042.00208" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and endeavor to obtain assistance from him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>I quickly rode off in search of my wagons, that the men might prepare and cook their flour, as we were still without meat; unfortunately the night was then far advanced, and, although every effort was made amid the darkness to get the wagons forward, dawn of the morning of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> broke upon us before many of the men had had time to do more than prepare the dough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>I was most anxious to get to the support of my old chief, and made strenuous efforts to do so; but, whilst on a forced march to accomplish this object, I received intelligence of our victory at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, and of <placeName key="tgn,7016129;tgn,2099733" n="0.205 000000.8181	placename;tgn,7016129;jackson, hinds, mississippi,Hinds,Mississippi,United States,North and Central America;0.171 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2099733;jackson, madison, tennessee,Madison,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America" reg="jackson, hinds, mississippi,Hinds,Mississippi,United States,North and Central America;jackson, madison, tennessee,Madison,Tennessee,United States,North and Central America">Jackson</placeName>'s mortal wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>I found, moreover, that my division would be exposed to a heavy fire from the main line of the enemy in position on the crest of the high range, of which <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0056.0003.00058.00345" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName> was the extreme left, and, by reason of the concavity of the enemy's main line, that we would be subject to a destructive fire in flank and rear, as well as in front; and deemed it almost an impossibility to clamber along the boulders up this steep and rugged mountain, and, under this number of cross fires, put the enemy to flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>I knew that if the feat was accomplished, it must be at a most fearful sacrifice of as brave and gallant soldiers as ever engaged in battle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The reconnoissance of my <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> scouts and the development of the <rs>Federal</rs> lines were effected in a very short space of time; in truth, shorter than I have taken to recall and jot down these facts, although the scenes and events of that day are as clear to my mind as if the great battle had been fought yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>I was in possession of these important facts so shortly after reaching the <placeName key="tgn,2034742" n="1.000 10" reg="Emmetsburg, Palo Alto, Iowa">Emmetsburg</placeName> road, that I considered it my duty to report to you, at once, my opinion that it was unwise to attack up the <placeName key="tgn,2034742" n="1.000 10" reg="Emmetsburg, Palo Alto, Iowa">Emmetsburg</placeName> road, as ordered, and to urge that you allow me to turn <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0056.0003.00058.00346" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName>, and attack the enemy in flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>During this interim I had continued the use of the batteries upon the enemy, and had become more and more convinced that the <rs>Federal</rs> line extended to <persName n="Top,,Round,,," id="n0056.0003.00058.00350" reg="default:Top,Round,,,"><foreName>Round</foreName> <surname>Top</surname></persName>, and that I could not reasonably hope to accomplish much by the attack as ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>In fact, it seemed to me the enemy occupied a position by nature so strong &mdash; I may say impregnable &mdash; that, independently of their flank fire, they could easily repel our attack by merely throwing and rolling stones down the mountain side, as we approached.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>I shall now demonstrate the actual loss during <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0004.00070.00448" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>In order to do this, it is necessary to prove what was the force <quote>at and near <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName>,</quote> or as I expressed it in my official report, <quote>In the easy direction of a single commander,</quote> <dateStruct value="1864-05-06"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="6">6th</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>It must be admitted that in order to estimate the loss of an Army during any campaign, <pb id="p.71" n="71"/>siege, or battle, it is necessary <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to ascertain the total effective force at the beginning of hostilities, and when the battle is over, or the siege, or campaign ended, again to find out the effective total, which, subtracted from the number at the outset, will unquestionably give the loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>This is the only means by which it can be fairly indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The losses of an Army are greater or less according to the manner in which the troops are handled; <hi rend="italics">i. e</hi>., an Army standing its ground and fighting, or advancing and driving the enemy, as was the case in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, under <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0056.0004.00071.00449" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, will count but few stragglers and deserters; the actual loss is not great, from the fact that the wounded men go to their homes proud of their wounds, and the majority of them are soon found again in the ranks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>On the other hand, an Army fighting and retreating at the same time, taking up positions, day after day, to be given up only under cover of darkness, suffers great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>During such a campaign, the orders necessary to be issued in withdrawing from the immediate presence of the enemy, are depressing, such as directing that dead silence be observed, wheels muffled, etc., for fear of discovery and being fired upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Let this policy be continued for a distance of <measure n="100miles" type="distance">one hundred miles</measure>, as it was from <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>, and the <quote>pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war</quote> are lost in a somewhat funereal procession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>The wounded cannot return home buoyant and hopeful, as they are forced to bear with them the chilling intelligence that the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> is falling back; in all such instances they tarry with their friends, and many fail to report again for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>However, the loss from this source is but small in comparison to that which accrues from the number of stragglers picked up by the enemy, and of deserters who, beholding their homes abandoned to the foe, become disheartened, and return to their families within the lines of the enemy, as was the case in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659"><rs type="direction">West</rs> Alabama</placeName> during <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0004.00071.00450" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s continued retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>In your movement to the north, across the open field, on that day, I covered your front and right, and my command was left to observe the enemy when a part of your corps was thrown across the <placeName reg="Canton, Madison, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056100">Canton</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>The enemy were in force in my front, with artillery and infantry, and developing toward our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>About an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> before nightfall the enemy broke through the skirmish line of an Alabama brigade posted to my left, and moved rapidly in rear of my main line, which was threatened in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>My reserve was, consequently, disposed to meet this movement in the rear, and encountered and repulsed the enemy in a short and severe engagement on and near the <placeName reg="Canton, Madison, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056100">Canton</placeName> road; but gathering reinforcements, he moved further to the rear, until I was completely isolated and cut off from your corps.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/> To extricate my command, I had to move to the right, fighting all the while in front and rear, until darkness put an end to hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>By making a detour of <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> in the night over a country devoid of road, I was enabled to rejoin your corps, massed in column about <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the night, and just in time for my wearied men to participate in the retreat across the <rs>Etowah</rs>, which was shortly after begun.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>During that campaign I kept a diary, which I have just examined to refresh my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>At the risk of being somewhat tedious, I will state all I know of that affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>Your corps being in the rear of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, entered <placeName reg="Cassville, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2022368">Cassville</placeName> about <time value="12mid">12 m.</time>, on the I8th of <dateStruct value="1864-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>Yourself and staff (on which I was active as volunteer aid) came in last and found the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> massed by brigades in front of <placeName reg="Cassville, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2022368">Cassville</placeName>,--that is, between that town and the approaching enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>So we remained all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Next morning I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> heard of the celebrated battle order of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00102.00768" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>I refer to that order in which it was announced that our retreat was ended, and that, if the enemy continued his advance, battle would then and there be given him. I thought it strange, if such were the determination, that the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> had not been placed in line of battle the evening before, when they would, at least, have been more comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>After our breakfast we rode to <placeName><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00102.00769" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, where you remained some half hour or more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>We then rode to <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00102.00770" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName>, which was immediately placed in motion to take up its position in line of battle, as I supposed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>As we marched across an open valley towards the range of hills which I understood to be the line to be occupied by our forces, you being in front with <persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00102.00771" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName> and I just behind, <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers called my attention to a dark line off to our right, saying they were <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>I called your attention to the fact, but you said it could not be so, but must be our cavalry, if it was a body of men. Falling back, the same soldier (to whom I had said I thought the dark line was a fence or hedge), said that they were throwing out skirmishers in our direction, and I at once called your attention to that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>You halted the division, and ordered <persName n="Hindman,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00102.00772" reg="mostcommon:Hindman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hindman</surname></persName> to send out a body of skirmishers to find out who they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>In a few minutes a sharp skirmish was in progress, and several of our men were wounded and killed in your immediate proximity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>I recollect very distinctly that <num value="5">five</num> men were hit at <num value="1">one</num> time <pb id="p.103" n="103"/>by the fragments of a shell, which exploded not more than <measure n="25yards" type="distance">twenty-five yards</measure> from where you were sitting on horseback.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>About this time <persName n="Mackall,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00103.00773" reg="mostcommon:Mackall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mackall</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">chief of staff</rs> to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00103.00774" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, rode up, apparently much excited, and spoke with you. Of course, I cannot say what took place, but soon after,--indeed, at once, and in his presence,--our direction was changed, and we proceeded to take up a line of battle on the range of hills immediately in rear of <placeName reg="Cassville, Bartow, Georgia" key="tgn,2022368">Cassville</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/> There we remained all day, the enemy erecting batteries in front and in flank of us, and enfilading our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>This fire of the enemy's artillery was harassing in the extreme, as it seemed to come from all directions except our immediate rear, and we made little or no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>Late that evening you took us (your staff) from the left of your corps to the extreme right (which was also the right of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>) and back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>I shall long remember that ride as <num value="1">one</num> of the most disagreeable it has ever been my fortune to take, being, as we were, continually under a heavy cross-fire of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>As soon as the ride was over, you proceeded to headquarters of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, and on your return you notified us that we would retreat at <time value="12am">midnight</time> across the <rs>Etowah</rs>, and gave us the necessary orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/> It was afterwards said in the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, indeed, I am not certain that a report by <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00103.00775" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was not published to that effect, that the retreat was ordered because you and <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0056.0005.00103.00776" reg="nearbymention:Polk,A.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> had declined to fight &mdash; or rather had given an opinion adverse to battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>I can say, after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> experience of war, that I am satisfied that no soldiers in the world could have held the line then occupied by your corps during the next day, unless the enemy had been very remiss in taking advantage of his position.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>The cause of this difference is simple, and easily understood by those who have had a practical demonstration of the superiority of the <rs>Lee</rs> and <rs>Jackson</rs> manner of handling troops over the <rs>Joe Johnston</rs> mode of warfare.

He well knew that the constant use of breastworks would teach his soldiers to look and depend upon such protection as an indispensable source of strength; would imperil that spirit of devil-me-care independence and self-reliance which was <num value="1">one</num> of their secret sources of power, and would, finally, impair the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of his Army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>A soldier cannot fight for a period of <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> constantly behind breastworks, with the training that he is equal to <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> of the enemy by reason of the security of his position, and then be expected to engage in pitched battle and prove as intrepid and impetuous as his brother who has been taught to rely solely upon his own valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>The latter, when ordered to charge and drive the enemy, will &mdash; or endeavor to &mdash; run over any obstacle he may encounter in his front; the former, on account of his undue appreciation of breastworks and distinct remembrance of the inculcations of his commanding officer, will be constantly on the look-out for such defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>His imagination will grow vivid under bullets and bombshells, and a brush-heap will so magnify itself in dimension as to induce him to believe that he is stopped by a wall <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> high and a mile in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>The consequence of his troubled imagination is that, if too proud to run, he will lie down, incur almost equal disgrace, and prove himself nigh worthless in a pitched battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>A somewhat similar result is to be observed in engagements, in the open field, with the red men of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>Those who are familiar with their mode of warfare well know that, whenever <pb id="p.132" n="132"/>they are attacked away from such shelter as trees and boulders, they at once become confused, and scatter in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>I concede that <num value="500">five hundred</num>, in the open field, would overpower <num value="100">one hundred</num> men, howsoever well trained; but <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> properly trained soldiers should always prove the equal of <num value="500">five hundred</num> <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0056.0008.00132.01070" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, mainly because of the difference in the manner of handling forces, practiced by the respective combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand, shelter is invariably sought in time of battle; on the other, reliance is placed upon boldness and valor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>In accordance with the same principle, a cavalryman <hi rend="italics">proper</hi> cannot be trained to fight, <num value="1">one</num> day, mounted, the next, dismounted, and then be expected to charge with the impetuosity of <num value="1">one</num> who has been educated in the belief that it is an easy matter to ride over infantry and artillery, and drive them from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>He who fights alternately mounted and dismounted, can never become an excellent soldier of either infantry or cavalry proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Moreover, the highest perfection in the education of troops, well drilled and disciplined, can only be attained through continued appeals to their pride, and through incitement to make known their prowess by the substantial test of guns and colors, captured upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>Soldiers thus educated will ever prove a terror to the foe. The continued use of breastworks during a campaign, renders troops timid in pitched battle; and the employment of such defences is judicious and profitable alone when resorted to at the proper time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>They should be used not unto excess, and only in such instances as I have already mentioned, and in such as I shall hereafter specify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>The result of training soldiers to rely upon their own courage, we behold in the achievements of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0056.0008.00132.01071" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Stephen,D.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1455"/>My experience during the recent war was nearly equally divided in serving with and without entrenchments.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>Entrenchments were generally used in my service in the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>They were not used in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> up to the time I was transferred <persName n="West,,,,," id="n0056.0008.00138.01103" reg="mostcommon:West,Douglas,,,:2"><surname>West</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>I am free to say that I consider it a great misfortune to any army to have to resort to entrenchments; its <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> is necessarily impaired from their constant use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>Troops once sheltered from fire behind works, never feel comfortable unless in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>The security of entrenchments is a constant subject of discussion by troops who use them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1462"/>It is a matter of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1463"/>They are taught that <num value="1">one</num> man equals <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1464"/>This they remember when called upon to attack entrenchments of the enemy, about which they are necessarily timid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>Troops in works, engaged the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, are always bolder than afterwards &mdash; stand erect and deliver their fire with precision as they were used to in the open field; after a few engagements, the thought of constant security is always with them, and their object is to be always covered by the works, while under fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>An army, accustomed to entrenchments, has its efficiency impaired as a whole, from the fact that in nearly every division <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> brigades consider it hazardous in the extreme to attack entrenchments; herce, in the attack hesitate, and hesitancy in attacking works is certain defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>A bold and defiant attack on works, though attended with great loss when successful, generally drives troops from the works before reaching themwhich shows that boldness in attack and nearness make a sudden change in the ideas of the troops behind the works, they being discouraged, and disappointed in not seeing the enemy easily and certainly driven back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>A general who resorts to entrenchments, when there is any chance of success in engaging in the open field, commits a great error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>Entrenchments are sometimes necessary for the safety of an army, encountering greatly superior numbers to gain time, or to save an army defeated by superior numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>When these occasions are plainly visible to the army, I do not see that its efficiency is necessarily impaired, when encountering the enemy again in the open field; but the habitual use of entrenchment certainly impairs the boldness of attack in any army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/><pb id="p.139" n="139"/></p> 
<p>To attack entrenchments, give me troops who have never served behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>Good troops, in line of battle, before using entrenchments, feel as secure without works as with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>As an instance, recall your division, at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, when attacked by more than <num value="5">five</num> times its number in an open field, or again your brigade at <placeName reg="Gaines's Mills">Gaines's Mills</placeName>, when it carried the works of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/> I would not be understood as arguing against the use of entrenchments when the occasion is plain for their use; but certainly against an army habitually using them; for the latter use of them destroys a plan of campaign, and there is no campaign; and the generals are besieging, or resisting a siege in fact, and with casualties from day to day soon equivalent to the loss in a general engagement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>Dear Sir:--I received a few days ago your letter of the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th ult.</day></dateStruct>, which was forwarded from New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>Its consequent delay in reaching me will in part account for my tardiness in replying.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>Whilst I fully appreciate your unwillingness to comply with my request, I cannot agree in forming with you the conclusion that I should remain silent upon this important matter of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>I have, with your consent granted at the time of our conversation in <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, already mentioned to a number of our common friends, the fact of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00155.01246" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s intention to abandon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, after his retreat from <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, as expressed to <persName n="McFarland,Mister,,,," id="n0056.0009.00155.01247" reg="mostcommon:McFarland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McFarland</surname></persName>; and <num value="1">one</num> of our friends, after listening with great interest to my assertion, and being informed that I had requested of you a written statement of the fact, remarked: <quote> If <persName n="Conrad,,Charles,M.,," id="n0056.0009.00155.01248" reg="default:Conrad,Charles,M.,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Conrad</surname></persName> told you this, he will give it to you in writing.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Moreover, I am not only indirectly but, I may say, directly concerned in this matter, from the fact that I have publicly stated that <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00155.01249" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> foreshadowed to his corps commanders at <orgName n="New Hope Church" type="church">New Hope Church</orgName>, his intention to retreat to <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>, during his campaign of &lsquo;<num value="64">64</num> from <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>I am the only living witness of this historic truth; therefore, <persName n="McFarland,Mister,,,," id="n0056.0009.00155.01250" reg="mostcommon:McFarland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McFarland</surname></persName>'s testimony, through <num value="1">one</num> of your prominence and character, becomes of great relative value to me.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>When I again have the leisure to continue my reply to the many unwarranted statements contained in <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00155.01251" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s book, I may find it necessary to bring forth also this important truth.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>When I recall the different events with which the military career of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00156.01253" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> is connected, it is difficult to believe that he ever had any other fixed plan than that of retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>Possibly the following paragraph in reference to a light engagement of <persName n="Hardee,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00156.01254" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,W.,J.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>, on the I5th of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, I865, near <placeName reg="Averysboroa">Averysboroa</placeName>, <name type="state" n="North Carolina"><placeName key="tgn,7007709" n="1.000 5" reg="north carolina">North Carolina</placeName></name>, may indicate the nature of his expectations, after a surrender of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>, etc., etc., and a final retreat to the seashore, the last point of resistance: <quote>That report, if correct, proves that the soldiers of <orgName n="Army"><persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00156.01255" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s Army</orgName> had been demoralized by their course of life on the <rs>Southern</rs> plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>Those soldiers, when fighting between <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>, could not have been driven back repeatedly by a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of their number, with a loss so utterly insignificant.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Was it <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00156.01256" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s policy to retreat till he had demoralized the enemy, and demoralized them by their course of life on Southern plantations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>An easy victory even at such cost would, indeed, have been dearly bought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>I do not wish to be understood as, in any manner, questioning the courage of this General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>He would have led men into action as gallantly as any soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>But leading men into action is <num value="1">one</num> thing, and ordering an Army into battle is another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>To issue an order of great moment and simply to obey instructions, involve such different measures of responsibility that a distinct degree of moral courage is requisite to fulfil either duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00156.01257" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> has defended himself by charging me with recklessness, and exposure of my troops to <quote>useless butchery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>I may, therefore, be pardoned if I point out what I consider his main defects &mdash; the reason, in fact, why his name is not coupled with a single glorious victory in the annals of our <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> struggle, since it is, most assuredly, not because of lack of personal courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>It becomes necessary to express myself somewhat explicitly, in order that no misapprehension be engendered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Caution and boldness are the <num value="2">two</num> predominant qualities which characterize all soldiers of merit &mdash; I mean the caution and boldness tempered by wisdom, which such men as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0056.0009.00156.01258" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> <pb id="p.157" n="157"/>I., <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0056.0009.00157.01259" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Stephen,D.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0056.0009.00157.01260" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Moltke,,Von,,," id="n0056.0009.00157.01261" reg="default:Moltke,Von,,,"><foreName>Von</foreName> <surname>Moltke</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Wolseley,Sir,Garnet,,," id="n0056.0009.00157.01262" reg="default:Wolseley,Garnet,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Garnet</foreName> <surname>Wolseley</surname></persName> have exhibited in so high a degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>These soldiers have shown themselves gifted with that intuition of the true warrior which rendered them bold in strategy, rapid in movement, and determined in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>Observation has taught me that a commander may acquire sufficient caution by receiving hard blows, but he cannot acquire boldness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>It is a gift from Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>A soldier whose quality of caution far exceeds that of boldness, can never be eminent in war. He cannot overcome nature, and experience that self-confidence requisite to order an Army into battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>If from pride or wounded vanity he make the venture, after long awaiting a more and more favorable opportunity, he will, as a rule, strike at the most unpropitious moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>Herein lies the deficiency of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00157.01263" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>He is a man of courage and ability, and a fine organizer of an Army for the field; but he lacks the bold genius of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0056.0009.00157.01264" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Stephen,D.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and, consequently, will rarely, if ever, see sufficient chances in his favor &mdash; especially at the right time &mdash; to induce him to risk battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/><placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName> is, I think, the only battle he attempted to inaugurate during the war, although it may be said that he commanded more men than any other <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>In this instance he had received information that a small body of the enemy had crossed the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>; he attempted to crush it with his entire force, and, even then, failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>He invariably throws up entrenchments, fortifies his line, and there remains in deliberation upon the best means to defeat the enemy without risking a general engagement, when, suddenly, he finds himself outflanked, and issues the usual order for retreat.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>The same defect &mdash; want of decision and self-reliance &mdash; exhibits itself eminently in the lower grades of rank in an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>Among <num value="10">ten</num> brave division commanders who, under orders, would lead their troops anywhere and everywhere, seldom will be found <num value="1">one</num> who, in a position to act upon his own responsibility, will attack at a favorable moment, especially when detached and ordered to the rear of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>If the <pb id="p.158" n="158"/>inquiry be made of any enterprising, self-reliant division commander who has participated in many engagements, as to how often his request has been granted when, heavily engaged with superior numbers, he has called upon his neighboring division commander (whose troops were lying inactive) to furnish him the assistance of a brigade, he will reply that rarely has succor been afforded, even in the most critical moment of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>His neighbor, albeit a man who knows not fear, was generally unwilling to act and give the necessary support without orders from his superior officer, because of his over-development of caution and his deficiency in boldness &mdash; the counterbalancing quality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>Again, few men are endowed with the capacity to execute such moves as those of <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0056.0009.00158.01265" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, at <rs n="Second Battle of Manassas" type="battle">Second Manassas</rs>, and at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, for the reason that, whilst en route to the rear of the enemy, the appearance of a light squad of their cavalry will cause a majority of officers to halt, form line, reconnoitre, and thus lose time and the opportunity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>I shall allow to pass unnoticed, in this reply several statements of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0009.00158.01267" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> which, although equally erroneous and illiberal in spirit, are too trivial to demand my attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>I shall, therefore, end this unpleasant discussion with a brief reference to his unpardonable conduct towards me, after he again assumed command in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>He was not unmindful that he had again been restored to power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1695"/>A feeling of reluctance to cause heart-burnings within the breast of any Confederate, who fulfilled his duty to the best of his ability, has, hitherto, deterred me from speaking forth the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1696"/>Since, however, military movements with which my name is closely connected, have been freely and publicly discussed by different authors, whose representations have not always been accurate, I feel compelled to give an account of the operations of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, whilst under my direction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>He deserted me in violation of his promise to remain and afford me the advantage of his counsel, whilst I shouldered all responsibility of the contest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>I reiterate that it is difficult to imagine a commander placed at the head of an Army under more embarrassing circumstances than those against which I was left to contend on the evening of the I8th of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, I864.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>The troops of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName> had for such length of time been subjected to the ruinous policy pursued from <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName> that they were unfitted for united action in pitched battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>They had, in other words, been so long habituated to security behind breastworks that they had become wedded to the <quote>timid defensive</quote> policy, and naturally regarded with distrust a commander likely to initiate offensive operations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>The senior Corps <rs type="role2">Commander</rs> considered he had been supplanted through my promotion, and thereupon determined to'resign, in consequence, I have no doubt, of my application to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0056.0010.00162.01286" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:11"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> to postpone the order transferring to me the command of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>; he however, altered his decision, and concluded to remain with his corps.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>It thus appears that on the afternoon of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> the enemy was in <placeName reg="Decatur, DeKalb, Georgia" key="tgn,2022643">Decatur</placeName>, almost at the gates of <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>This intelligence must have been communicated to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0010.00163.01301" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> by the cavalry, after he left me to ride into the city with the promise to return toward evening, as he was virtually <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> up to the moment of his sudden departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>I had consumed a great portion of that day in vain endeavors to adjust the difficulties in the way of his retention in command, by earnest representations to him, on <num value="1">one</num> hand, and, on the other, by telegraphing to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in the hope of accomplishing this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>Although he had published his farewell order the night previous, I had not, owing to the foregoing reasons, assumed command.

<p>Much confusion necessarily arose during this interval; and this condition of affairs accounts for the circumstance, which must seem strange to military men, that at this late date I am apprised for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, and through <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0056.0010.00164.01302" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s Memoirs, of the presence of the enemy's <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>, at <time value="2pm">2 p. m.</time> on the <dateStruct value="-07-18"><day reg="18">18th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, upon the railroad leading to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>It must seem equally strange that, if I was regarded as chief in command, this important movement was not made known to me at headquarters by our cavalry, which was, generally, very prompt in reporting all such information.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>These facts give evidence of the trying position in which I was placed at this juncture, and this last move of the enemy may somewhat account for the inexplicable conduct and disappearance of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0056.0010.00164.01305" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> who, at this critical moment, was unwilling to share with me the responsibility of the issue.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>I will now turn from the many unpleasant occurrences interwoven in the history of that day, and endeavor to show in what manner <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0056.0010.00164.01306" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> exposed, on his approach to <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>, the <rs>Federal Army</rs> to successful attack by our troops; and, at the same time, state why, in my opinion, after our discovery of his blunders, the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName> did not succeed in defeating and routing his forces.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1725"/>These premises may seem bold, especially since defeat was our fortune, and victory the boast of our adversary.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>Our troops had awakened in me heartfelt sympathy, as I had followed their military career with deep interest from early in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> of that year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>I had witnessed their splendid condition at that period; had welcomed with pride the fine body of reinforcements under <persName n="Polk,General,,,," id="n0056.0010.00165.01307" reg="mostcommon:Polk,A.,M.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>; but, with disappointment, I had seen them, day after day, turn their back upon the enemy, and lastly cross the <placeName reg="Chattahoochee River, Columbus, Georgia" key="tgn,2233898">Chattahoochee river</placeName> on the night of the <dateStruct value="-07-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> with <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of their number lost &mdash; the men downcast, dispirited, and demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Stragglers and deserters, the captured and the killed, could not now, however, be replaced by recruits, because all the recruiting depots had been drained to reinforce either <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0056.0010.00165.01308" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Stephen,D.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> or <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0056.0010.00165.01309" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1730"/>I could, therefore, but make the best dispositions in my power with the reduced numbers of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, which opposed a force of <num value="106000">one hundred and six thousand</num> (<num value="106000">106,000</num>) Federals, buoyant with success and hope, and who were fully equal to <num value="140000">one hundred and forty thousand</num> (<num value="140000">140,000</num>) such troops as confronted <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0056.0010.00165.01310" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,2022620" n="1.000 4" reg="dalton, whitfield, georgia">Dalton</placeName>, by reason of their victorious march of a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> into the heart of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>Although the attack upon us was Fenewed again and again, both from the front and rear, we were still able to maintain our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>Late in the day, I drew out my forces from the line which they had occupied, and took up a new position, extending from the hill where my right had formerly rested, and extending toward the position in which I have described the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 16">Sixteenth Corps</orgName> to have occupied in my rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>Therefore the only correct method of ascertaining the entire loss, during a siege or a campaign, is to deduct the number of effectives at the close of the siege, or campaign, from the number of effectives at the beginning of operations, after adding to the total strength the number of reinforcements, and deducting therefrom the number of troops permanently detached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>It is due to that gallant soldier and gentleman to say that no act of his distinguished career gives the least color to your <pb id="p.233" n="233"/>unfounded aspersions upon his conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2382"/>I make none now, but there are a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> witnesses that you fired into the habitations of women and children for weeks, firing far above and miles beyond my line of defence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2384"/> The residue of your letter is rather discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2385"/>It opens a wide field for the discussion of questions which I do not feel are committed to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2389"/>The truth is, we fired upon it, and those who fought under it, when you came to our doors upon the mission of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2390"/>You say we seized upon your forts and arsenals, and made prisoners of <pb id="p.234" n="234"/>the garrisons sent to protect us against Indians and negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2391"/>The truth is, we, by force of arms, drove out insolent intruders and took possession of our own forts and arsenals, to resist your claims to do minion over masters, slaves, and <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0056.0014.00234.01917" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, all of whom are to this day, with a unanimity unexampled in the history of the world, warring against your attempts to become their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>The truth is, my Government, from the beginning of this struggle to this hour, has again and again offered, before the whole world, to leave it to the unbiassed will of these States, and all others, to determine for themselves whether they will cast their destiny with your Government or ours; and your Government has resisted this fundamental principle of free institutions with the bayonet, and labors daily, by force and fraud, to fasten its hateful tyranny upon the unfortunate freemen of these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2394"/>You say we falsified the vote of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2395"/>The truth is, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> not only separated herself from your Government by nearly a unanimous vote of her people, but has vindicated the act upon every battle-field from <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> to the <rs>Sabine</rs>, and has exhibited an heroic devotion to her decision, which challenges the admiration and respect of every man capable of feeling sympathy for the oppressed or admiration for heroic valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2396"/>You say that we turned loose pirates to plunder your unarmed ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>The truth is, when you robbed us of our part of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>, we built and bought a few vessels, hoisted the flag of our country, and swept the seas, in defiance of your Navy, around the whole circumference of the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2398"/>You say we have expelled Union families by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2399"/>The truth is, not a single family has been expelled from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, that I am aware of; but, on the contrary, the moderation of our Government towards traitors has been a fruitful theme of denunciation by its enemies and well meaning friends of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2400"/>You say my Government, by acts of Congress, has confiscated <quote>all debts due Northern men for goods sold and delivered.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2401"/>The truth is, our Congress gave due and ample time to your merchants and traders to depart from our shores with their ships, goods, and effects, and only sequestrated the property of our enemies in retaliation for their acts &mdash; declaring us traitors, and confiscating our property wherever their power extended, either in their country or our own. Such are your accusations, and such are the facts known of all men to be true.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2402"/>You order into exile the whole population of a city; drive men, women, and children from their homes at the point of the bayonet, under the plea that it is to the interest of your Government, and on the claim that it is an act of <quote> kindness to these families of <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2404"/>You issue a sweeping <pb id="p.235" n="235"/>edict, covering all the inhabitants of a city, and add insult to the injury heaped upon the defenceless by assuming that you have done them a kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2405"/>This you follow by the assertion that you <quote>will make as much sacrifice for the peace and honor of the <rs>South</rs> as the best born Southerner.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2406"/>And, because I characterize what you call a kindness as being real cruelty, you presume to sit in judgment between me and my <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and you decide that my earnest prayer to the <rs>Almighty Father</rs> to save our women and children from what you call kindness, is a <quote>sacrilegious, hypocritical appeal.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2407"/>You came into our country with your Army, avowedly for the purpose of subjugating free white men, women, and children, and not only intend to rule over them, but you make negroes your allies, and desire to place over us an inferior race, which we have raised from barbarism to its present position, which is the highest ever attained by that race, in any country, in all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>In order to compass this end, either the <rs>Federals</rs> should be forced back by manoeuvres into the mountains, there defeated in battle, and finally driven northward; or an attempt be made to defeat them upon their march forward, <hi rend="italics">after</hi> <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0056.0015.00243.01960" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had been allowed full time to rest his troops, make preparations, and receive reinforcements, for, in the meantime, it would have been rashness and folly, in view of our inferior numbers, to have attacked the enemy whilst under the protection of the breastworks of <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>In lieu of dividing his forces, as he did when I eventually marched to his rear, he would either have increased the strength of his Army to the fullest extent possible, previous to his forward movement, in order not only to brush away more easily the cobweb of an Army in his front, but also to overawe and discourage our people by the presence of an Army strong and powerful; or he would have ordered <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0056.0015.00246.01985" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,H.,,:3"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, with instructions to muster all available forces and march into <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> with a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Army, whilst he moved through <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>On the other hand, our Army of <num value="40403">forty thousand four hundred and three</num> (<num value="40403">40,403</num>) would have gradually decreased through desertions, with no prospect of obtaining another man east of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, and with the information in my possession from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, that no troops were shortly expected from the <orgName n="Department of Trans-Mississippi" type="department">Trans-Mississippi Department</orgName>, although every effort had been made by the <rs>Government</rs> to get reinforcements from that quarter.</p>

<p>As a corps commander, I regarded the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> greatly impaired after the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>, and in fact <hi rend="italics">before</hi> its fall, the troops were not by any means in good spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>It was my observation and belief that the majority of the officers and men were so impressed with the idea of their inability to carry even temporary breastworks, that when orders were given for attack, and there was a probability of encountering works, they regarded it as recklessness in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>In making these observations, it is due to many gallant officers and commands to state that there were noticeable exceptions; but the feeling was so general that anything like a general attack was paralyzed by it. The Army having constantly yielded to the flank movements of the enemy, which he could make with but little difficulty by reason of his vastly superior numbers, and having failed in the offensive movements prior to the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName>, its efficiency for further retarding the progress of the enemy was much impaired, and besides the advantages in the topography of the country south of <placeName key="tgn,7013331" n="1.000 10" reg="atlanta, fulton, georgia">Atlanta</placeName> were much more favorable to the enemy for the movements of his superior numbers than the rough and mountainous country already yielded to him.
