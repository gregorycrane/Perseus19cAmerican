<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>Having met <persName n="Dana,,Charles,A.,," id="n0179.0001.00010.00001" reg="expanded:Dana,Charles,Anderson,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the spring of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, during the <rs>Vicksburg</rs> campaign, it was my good-fortune to serve with him in the field during <num value="3">three</num> of the most memorable campaigns of the <rs>Civil War</rs>, and for a short period under him as a bureau officer of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Our duties threw us much together, and of all the men I ever met he was the most delightful companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Overflowing with the knowledge of art, science, and literature, and widely acquainted as he was with the leading men and movements of the times, his conversation was a constant delight and a constant instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Blessed with a vigorous constitution and an insatiable desire for information, he never once, by day or night, or in the presence of danger, however great, declined to accompany me on an expedition or an adventure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Naturally this companionship begot both a confidence and an intimacy that, I am glad to say, lasted to the end of his career, and are my warrant for becoming his biographer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>As a journalist and as <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, <persName n="Dana,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0001.00010.00002" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the most influential men of his time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Weighed for the strength and variety of his faculties, and for his power to interest and impress men's minds, he must be considered as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of American editors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Yet it happened that in the great era of the <rs>Civil War</rs> his energies were so powerfully called upon, and his services were so vigorous and effective, that he must also be classed among the real heroes of that unequalled conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>By his pen no less <pb id="p.-011" n="-011"/> than by his official action, he exerted a tremendous influence upon both the men and the measures of his day. As field correspondent, and office assistant to <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0179.0001.00011.00003" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,:6"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, the great War <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>, he was potent in deciding the fate of leading generals as well as in shaping the military policies of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>With the possible exception of <persName n="Rawlins,,John,A.,," id="n0179.0001.00011.00004" reg="default:Rawlins,John,A.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Rawlins</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant Adjutant-General</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Staff">Chief of Staff</rs> to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0179.0001.00011.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0001.00011.00006" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> exerted a greater influence over <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0179.0001.00011.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:4"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s military career than any other man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It is perhaps well to add that while his family and his associates have put me in possession of many letters, documents, and clippings bearing on his public and private life, and have given me every possible assistance in the preparation of this work, I am solely responsible for its character and for the opinions which the reader will find expressed in the following pages.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He was <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> in the male line, from <persName n="Dana,,Richard,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00013" reg="default:Dana,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName>, the colonial settler, through <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName> <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00014" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Charles,,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00015" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00016" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Charles,,,"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName> <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In the female line, he was descended from <persName n="Bullard,,Ann,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00017" reg="default:Bullard,Ann,,,"><foreName>Ann</foreName> <surname>Bullard</surname></persName>, Patience---, <persName n="Adams,,Abigail,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00018" reg="default:Adams,Abigail,,,"><foreName>Abigail</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, <persName n="Huntington,,Susanna,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00019" reg="default:Huntington,Susanna,,,"><foreName>Susanna</foreName> <surname>Huntington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Kibbe,,Dolly,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00020" reg="default:Kibbe,Dolly,,,"><foreName>Dolly</foreName> <surname>Kibbe</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Denison,,Ann,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00021" reg="default:Denison,Ann,,,"><foreName>Ann</foreName> <surname>Denison</surname></persName>, whose mother, it should be noted, was <persName n="Paine,,Anne,,," id="n0179.0002.00001.00022" reg="default:Paine,Anne,,,"><foreName>Anne</foreName> <surname>Paine</surname></persName>, a daughter of <num value="1">one</num> of the best-known and most widely disseminated families of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It will be observed that although the surname of <num value="1">one</num> of these maternal ancestors is unknown, there is every reason to believe that, like the rest, her family were colonists of straight <name>English</name> blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The same statement is doubtless true in reference to all the collateral connections, hence it may be confidently asserted that, with the exception of the attenuated stream from the <rs>Italian</rs> forebears of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settler, the <rs>Dana</rs> family <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> is of absolutely pure <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>A study of its genealogy shows that practically every ramification of it has its American root in the earliest immigration of the colonists, a fact that well accounts for <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00002.00023" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Richard,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s character as <num value="1">one</num> of the most intense <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00002.00024" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most stalwart believers in the <rs>American</rs> people, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most devoted partisans of American institutions that the country has produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>While the family records show but little of unusual distinction, they are filled with the names of serious men and women of all occupations and callings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In common with their neighbors, some were farmers, some mechanics, some merchants, some soldiers, and some sailors, with here and there an author, professor, lawyer, doctor, <rs type="role" n="General">general</rs>, judge, legislator, and even a governor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>While they were mostly plain and unpretentious people, they seem to have been always abreast of the times in native intelligence, industry, scholarship, courage, and public spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Nearly the whole fell sick of the ague, at that time the scourge of every new <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> #earlier years settlement in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The mother died, leaving <num value="4">four</num> young children, <persName n="Anderson,,Charles,,," id="n0179.0002.00003.00028" reg="default:Anderson,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> <num value="9">nine</num>, <persName n="Junius,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00003.00029" reg="mostcommon:Junius,nomatch:0"><surname>Junius</surname></persName> <num value="7">seven</num>, <persName><foreName>Maria</foreName></persName> <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of age, and <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> a babe in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This loss made it necessary for the family to return to the home of <persName n="Denison,,Ann,,," id="n0179.0002.00003.00030" reg="default:Denison,Ann,,,"><foreName>Ann</foreName> <surname>Denison</surname></persName>'s father near <placeName key="tgn,2109686" n="1.000 5" reg="guildhall, essex, vermont">Guildhall</placeName> in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828"><rs type="direction">northeastern</rs> Vermont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Fortunately the teacher was an undergraduate of a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> college, who was not only competent but took an interest in his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> naturally made rapid progress, and by the time he was <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of age had become so proficient in most of his <name>English</name> studies that he was classed with boys as much as <num value="6">six</num> and <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> his senior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Early after becoming a member of his uncle's family, he came into possession of a Latin grammar, and at once began the study of Latin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Whether this merely stimulated his natural aptitude, or developed an inherited but latent instinct for language, must necessarily remain a matter of speculation; but it is certain that from that time forward this <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> lad, with but a slight strain of Continental blood in his veins, showed an extraordinary capacity for the acquisition of foreign tongues and the study of both ancient and modern literature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>By the time he had fairly entered his <num value="12" type="ordinal">twelfth</num> year, it was supposed that he had acquired sufficient education, especially in reading, writing, and arithmetic, to earn his own living, and accordingly, with the consent of his uncle and grandfather, he was sent to <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, where he arrived greatly exhausted from the long and tiresome journey by <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> stage-coach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>After several weeks' rest he became a clerk in the general store of <persName n="Staats,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00004.00032" reg="mostcommon:Staats,nomatch:0"><surname>Staats</surname></persName> &amp; <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00004.00033" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,Anderson,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This was a most important move in the life of the young adventurer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It placed him in a wider and more progressive field than was offered by the wilds of <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828"><rs type="direction">northeastern</rs> Vermont</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It contained a population of about <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> souls, and counted a number of distinguished lawyers and doctors as well as prosperous merchants among the principal citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>A brief but animated conversation followed, and before it was ended a smile of gratification broke over <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00005.00044" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Ely,S.,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s face, and an acquaintance was begun which lasted till his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He and <persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00005.00046" reg="nearbymention:Parker,Ely,S.,,"><surname>Parker</surname></persName> met frequently during the various campaigns in which they took part, and were in the habit of conversing in the <rs>Seneca</rs> dialect, especially when they did not care to be understood by others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>This incident attracted the special notice of the other officers present, and particularly of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0179.0002.00005.00047" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, upon whom it apparently made a deep and lasting impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The general, it will be noted, was not much of a linguist himself, but he often mentioned this talk at his camp-fire as illustrating <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00005.00048" reg="nearbymention:Dana,William,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s unusual talents in that direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It will be recalled that he had begun the study of Latin at his uncle's in <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName>, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> and now that his new life as a clerk not only gave him more leisure of evenings, but brought him in contact with a larger circle of educated people, he renewed the study of that language with avidity and industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>His progress was phenomenal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He not only mastered the grammar, but soon became proficient in reading the <rs>Latin</rs> classics, which in those days were supposed to be the only sure foundation for a liberal education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Just how or when the young clerk began with the <name>Greek</name> grammar and literature is not recorded, but that he did begin probably while at work in <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, and that he made the same rapid progress as with Latin, becomes certain when his later attainments are considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He was from the start a good clerk, and mastered the details of the business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Indeed, there is reason to believe that he always looked back upon his experience in his uncle's store as having made a business man of him, although it is certain that he early acquired a distaste for store-keeping if not for commerce, and secretly determined to become a scholar and devote himself to a professional life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>He received a salary for his services, and while it was but small, as was customary in those days, the cost of living was correspondingly low, and hence he was able to lay by something for future use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><num value="1">One</num> who was a fellow-clerk for several years describes him as <quote>a quiet, studious boy who loved nature and books, and although a good salesman, rather prone to spend too much time in the adjoining book-store looking over volumes he could not buy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It is said that when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw <placeName reg="Niagara Falls, Niagara, New York" key="tgn,7014229">Niagara Falls</placeName>, he was so impressed by them that he composed an ode on their grandeur which had considerable merit, but as it has long been lost this statement must be taken on faith.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>As the lad grew in strength and intelligence, his taste <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> for literature and his determination to acquire a thorough education became the ruling purpose of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Although he dressed well and was agreeable in manners, he rather shunned than sought social gatherings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He thought they took too much time, and that he had better spend his evenings at home reading poetry, romance, and history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>During this period he became greatly interested in the <rs>American Revolution</rs> and in the early presidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>He specially admired <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0179.0002.00007.00050" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and sounded the praises of the great <rs>Tennesseean</rs> upon all proper occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he was unusually independent in the selection of his books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Among the rest, he read and openly expressed his admiration for the works of <persName n="Paine,,Tom,,," id="n0179.0002.00007.00051" reg="default:Paine,Tom,,,"><foreName>Tom</foreName> <surname>Paine</surname></persName>, possibly because he may have been a distant kinsman, but certainly because he was a patriot who addressed his countrymen, in <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Common Sense" type="newspaper">Common Sense</orgName></hi> and <hi rend="italics">The Crisis</hi>, in virile and masterly <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00007.00052" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Until he was <num value="17">seventeen</num>, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00007.00053" reg="nearbymention:Dana,William,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> confined his general reading to the masters of <name>English</name> literature, and this fact doubtless accounts for the purity and vigor of the style which from that time forth characterized his correspondence as well as his more formal writings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He was now in the period of his dawning ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The world and its mysteries were opening before him, and alluring him to explore and master their significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>With the avid curiosity which is the chief characteristic of youth, he sought by all the means within his reach to know, not only the history of his country, but the nature of man and the motive of his actions in the pursuits of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He was indifferent to nothing which opened the secrets of history or revealed the laws of the visible world about him; but even in his earliest reading it is to be observed he showed a decided preference for the study of man and his attainments rather than for science; for literature and art rather than for mathematics and <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> physics; and that in his chosen field he regarded language as the chief instrument &mdash; the aster-key with which to unlock the secrets of the intellectual world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>And this explains why henceforth, even to the end of his career, the study of language was his chief occupation and delight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The militia was called out, but, barring a few parades and marches through the streets of <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, it took no part in active operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Notwithstanding a serious and cautious turn of mind, he shared the public sympathies, and regarded himself as fully able to do a man's part, not only towards maintaining the public order, but in defending the public interests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The Patriot War, however exciting, was a passing episode which soon gave way to another of far greater concern to the subject of this narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>A great financial and business crisis was at hand, which, unfortunately for the uncle and his partner, but perhaps fortunately for their young clerk, was about to overwhelm the firm in irremediable ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It will be recalled that a wild and destructive panic which involved all kinds of business throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> took place in <dateStruct value="1837--"><year reg="1837">1837</year></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Of course young <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00009.00059" reg="nearbymention:Dana,William,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> shared the fate of his companions, and thus found himself unexpectedly at the parting of the ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>His career as a merchant's clerk, except for temporary employment the next year by <orgName><orgName type="company"><persName n="Wright,,George,,," id="n0179.0002.00009.00060" reg="default:Wright,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> &amp; Company</orgName></orgName>, was ended without the slightest regard to his preferences; but they now asserted themselves, and without hesitation he decided to enter college as soon as he could make the necessary arrangements and complete his preparation in scholarship, which was done entirely by himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>While it is not positively known, it is altogether probable that he selected <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> mainly through the influence of his friend and neighbor <persName n="Flint,Doctor,Austin,,," id="n0179.0002.00009.00061" reg="default:Flint,Austin,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Austin</foreName> <surname>Flint</surname></persName>, a brilliant young practitioner of medicine who had graduated there in <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, and removed to <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName> to enter upon his profession <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Encouraged by his friends, sustained by his ambition, and impelled by his cherished purposes, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00009.00066" reg="nearbymention:Dana,William,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> left <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName> to enter upon his new life in <dateStruct value="1839-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>He was then about <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of age, tall and slender, with a fresh complexion, fastidious in taste and habits, and highly esteemed by all who knew him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It shows the wide range of his reading on the subject of his lecture, and exemplifies his poetical theories, his power of statement, and his canons of criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>While his style at that time appears somewhat stilted, it was surprisingly clear, direct, and comprehensive for a lad of his years and opportunities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Speaking in after years to an old friend, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0002.00010.00068" reg="nearbymention:Dana,William,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> declared, that <quote>the best days of his life, as regards health and happiness, were spent in <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, whence he went to fish in the <rs>Niagara</rs>, to hunt in the <rs>American</rs> and <rs>Canadian</rs> woods, to hobnob with the <name>Indians</name> at their reservation near by, and to make trips down the river to the falls.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It was surely a delightful region, which he must have left with regret, and to which he returned with pleasure whenever he had the opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>His best and most intimate friends still lived there, and were always ready to receive him with open arms and a generous welcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He had passed his teens and reached his adolescence among them, and in entering upon a still broader field of life and intellectual development, he naturally turned to these friends and this home of his youth for sympathy and encouragement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>It should be stated that his father, who appears to have always been somewhat of a dreamer and never a successful <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> or forehanded man, had married again and was raising a new family, which taxed his slender resources to the utmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/><persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, like the rest, was therefore forced to depend absolutely upon himself and such chance assistance as he could secure from his friends, or from the funds of the college which he attended.

<p>I hasten to answer your letter which reached me last evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Upon receiving it, I immediately conversed with the president on the subject, and ascertained what I supposed was the fact, that there is a fund which is loaned on easy terms to young men desirous of availing themselves of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>I advise you by all means to return to college, for with your abilities and honorable purposes it is impossible you should fail of success, and this I should have said to you before had I known that you were about to leave the college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Coming as it did from <num value="1">one</num> of the most learned and influential members of the faculty, afterwards for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> its honored president, it makes it clear that <persName n="Dana,,Charles,,," id="n0179.0003.00014.00082" reg="default:Dana,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName> was even at that early day no ordinary person, but <num value="1">one</num> who arrested the attention <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> and excited the sympathetic interest of those in authority over him. He always cherished these words of regret, encouragement, and counsel, as well he might, for the confidence and strength they must have given him in the struggles which beset his career from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>At all events, he did return from time to time to his college work, until he had completed his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year, when he was forced to give it up entirely by the failure of his eyes, which will be more fully referred to hereafter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>As it appears from the records of the faculty, he early gave up mathematics and the sciences, and concentrated his mind upon the classics, literature, and philosophy, for which he then had a decided predilection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It is worthy of note, that while in later life he was by no means indifferent to the sciences, all of which made such tremendous strides during the last half of the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> century, he always held that a thorough knowledge of both ancient and modern languages was a useful equipment for the profession of journalism.</p>

School-teaching, though useful, was wearisome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>It not only compelled him to study the ordinary branches in order to keep ahead of his pupils, but gave him an opportunity of evenings to continue the study of his college course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>But it had another influence which was not so favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It necessarily took him out of the college much of the time, and thus deprived him of college society, and of association with his classmates, with few of whom he ever came to be intimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>He was an industrious and omnivorous reader, and whether in or out of college wasted but little time in the diversions and pleasures of college life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>While at <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName> he kept up a somewhat desultory correspondence with his family, and especially with his father, who cautioned him to write only <quote>as often by mail as really necessary,</quote> adding, <quote>I live a few rods from the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> and can in some way pay the postage even if <persName n="Kendall,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0003.00016.00085" reg="mostcommon:Kendall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kendall</surname></persName> (the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs>) pleases to require specie.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>I find no evidence that he ever formally united with the <rs>Unitarian</rs> or any other church, but he made it clear in his correspondence with his friends at <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName> that he at <num value="1">one</num> time thought seriously of studying theology and becoming a minister of the gospel.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The <orgName n="Brook Farm Association" type="association">Brook Farm Association</orgName> was undoubtedly a Transcendental movement, inasmuch as it was the outgrowth of pure idealism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The germ of the plan may have sprung from the <name>Neuhof</name> of Pestalozzi, who was a Transcendentalist, but <persName n="Ripley,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00036.00196" reg="nearbymention:Ripley,George,,,"><surname>Ripley</surname></persName> always insisted that it was an evolution of <quote>pure idealism.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> were spent in <quote>getting started,</quote> and in organizing the <quote><placeName reg="Brook Farm Institute">Brook Farm Institute</placeName> of Agriculture and education,</quote> which constituted the special attraction <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> to <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00037.00198" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>, who joined late in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> and took part in forming the articles of association, getting subscriptions to the stock, and in electing the officers of the institute.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The favorite number seems to have been <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Of the entire amount subscribed only <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> was actually paid in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The sole asset of the association was the farm, mortgaged at the start for more than its value, while its only dependence for actual income was the farm produce which might be grown, and the charge for tuition and board which would be furnished to such as might join the institute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I have given these details for the purpose of showing that the association, whatever might have been its merits as a business undertaking, and however unsound or visionary may have been the principles and aims on which it was founded, was fore-doomed to failure, primarily for lack of capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>It was doubtless an honest and unselfish <pb id="p.38" n="38"/> effort at co-operation, but it ought to have been manifest to its supporters from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day that the association was too limited in membership, ant included too few of the various interdependent vocations of life to justify the slightest hope of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Although every member of the association was to receive pay for his work, and give pay for what he got, it ought to have been apparent that neither the farm, with its short hours of unskilled labor, nor the school with its limited attendants, could possibly earn enough to sustain the enterprise and keep it out of bankruptcy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>It is worthy of note, however, that notwithstanding its insufficiency of capital and its paucity of production, the association sustained itself and perhaps gained a little on its initial strength for about <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The simplicity of life and the insufficiency of the charges at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> are well indicated by a letter from <persName n="Curtis,,George,W.,," id="n0179.0004.00038.00203" reg="expanded:Curtis,George,William,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Curtis</surname></persName> and his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Burrill</foreName></persName>, belonging to a well-to-do New York family, written in a beautiful hand to <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00038.00204" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1842-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Still its expenses increased, the deficit grew, and a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> mortgage was negotiated and placed upon the property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>It should be said in fairness, however, that the community had continued to grow till it had become too numerous for the original accommodations, and hence it was necessary to build a larger, more commodious, and better arranged house, which under the new organization was to be known as the <quote>Phalanstery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The old farm-house, romantically designated as <quote>The Hive,</quote> with its subsidiary buildings, <quote>The cottage,</quote> <quote>The Eyrie,</quote> and the stables were prettily situated, and the whole place, with its collection of clever men and charming women, was most attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>As a consequence, the farm grew in value from the start, and when it was sold, in <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, it brought, at public auction, <measure n="19150dollars" type="currency">nineteen thousand one hundred and fifty dollars</measure>, or a sum sufficient to pay off all the mortgages, executions, and <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> accumulated interest, and leave a clear balance of <measure n="1704dollars" type="currency">seventeen hundred and four dollars</measure> to be applied to other claims against the <quote>Phalanx.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>It never opened its doors to the world at large, but selected its members from the best of those asking to be admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Its plan was to pay each member fairly for his work, and charge a fair price for what each person got. Manifestly a society of this sort might continue to flourish so long as it chose its members with proper care, sold its stock for a sufficiently high price, and had a membership sufficiently large to include all the necessary human pursuits, with a market of outsiders sufficiently near to buy its surplus products at remunerative prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>While the limits of this memoir will not permit the quotation of this entire article, its conclusion is so pertinent to existing conditions that I give it as follows: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/></p> 
<p><gap/>From intimate acquaintance of many years with commercial life, and from careful observation of both large and small commercial transactions, we are constrained to believe that in commerce absolute and complete honesty, integral <pb id="p.52" n="52"/> <name>Christian</name> honesty, is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>This is a broad and strong assertion, but we appeal to the inmost consciousness of those of our readers who are acquainted with the matter if it be not true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>Modern commerce wears a more decent coat, perhaps, but underneath it is but little altered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Whatever exceptions we may find, all will admit that its constant tendency is to destroy individual integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Is not this enough to condemn civilized commerce, and incite us to substitute for it a system of guarantees and security, by removing commerce entirely from the grasp of individual selfishness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The method of doing this with security and advantage is known to us; we shall hereafter take occasion to bring it forward.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Perhaps, after all, he came to the conclusion that it was a subject beyond his powers, though he may have included his treatment of it in his disquisitions upon the scope and advantages of <quote>Universal Association,</quote> as found in various numbers of the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Those of the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> were all published in the <hi rend="italics">Harbinger</hi>, from which they obtained some circulation, but I cannot learn that any of them outlived the year of its birth, or passed permanently into the literature of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Indeed, there is <num value="1">one</num> good reason to believe that the author finally condemned them himself, for he enshrined none of them in the <hi rend="italics">American Household Book of Poetry</hi>, a well-known and widely circulated book of the best short poems in the language, of which he was the compiler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>He doubtless gave his own poetic children every consideration to which he thought they were entitled, as they were found among his personal effects clearly transcribed, and done up ready for the printer, but several of them had been carefully crossed out with the blue pencil from the pages on which they were copied at the date of their production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>These poems show that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00302" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was going through a period of mental activity and development in which every faculty was cultivated to the highest degree by study, reflection, and composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Surely and steadily the idealist and dreamer was laying down his illusions and taking up the methods of a practical business-man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>He was then, and remained throughout his life, devoted to idealism, poetry, and romance, but never after that time did he allow either to lead him away from the practical duties of the hour.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>It is worthy of passing notice that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00303" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> for a part of this period also kept a book of quotations which abounds in extracts from <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00304" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName>, <persName n="Longfellow,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00305" reg="mostcommon:Longfellow,nomatch:0"><surname>Longfellow</surname></persName>, <persName n="Wordsworth,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00306" reg="mostcommon:Wordsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wordsworth</surname></persName>, <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00307" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>, Motherwell, <rs type="role" reg="Cousin">Cousin</rs>, <persName n="Considerant,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00308" reg="nearbymention:Considerant,M.,,,"><surname>Considerant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00309" reg="mostcommon:Fourier,Charles,,,:1"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>, <persName n="Schiller,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00310" reg="mostcommon:Schiller,nomatch:0"><surname>Schiller</surname></persName>, <persName n="Goethe,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00311" reg="mostcommon:Goethe,nomatch:0"><surname>Goethe</surname></persName>, <persName n="Spinoza,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00312" reg="mostcommon:Spinoza,nomatch:0"><surname>Spinoza</surname></persName>, <persName n="Heine,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00313" reg="mostcommon:Heine,nomatch:0"><surname>Heine</surname></persName>, <persName n="Herman,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00314" reg="mostcommon:Herman,nomatch:0"><surname>Herman</surname></persName>, <persName n="Kepler,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00315" reg="mostcommon:Kepler,nomatch:0"><surname>Kepler</surname></persName>, Bruno, Novalis, Bohme, <persName n="Swedenborg,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00316" reg="mostcommon:Swedenborg,nomatch:0"><surname>Swedenborg</surname></persName>, <persName><foreName>Virgil</foreName></persName>, <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Cicero,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00317" reg="mostcommon:Cicero,nomatch:0"><surname>Cicero</surname></persName>, <persName n="Thucydides,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00318" reg="mostcommon:Thucydides,nomatch:0"><surname>Thucydides</surname></persName>, <persName n="Euripides,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00056.00319" reg="mostcommon:Euripides,nomatch:0"><surname>Euripides</surname></persName>, and Sallust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>These extracts consist of lofty thoughts and sentiments, which necessarily touched responsive chords in his own soul, or else they would not have been gathered.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>From the foregoing statement it is evident that the <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00057.00322" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> passed at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> with the friends he loved had gone far to prepare him for the battle of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>They brought him many benefits for which he always remained grateful, but the greatest benefit and blessing which it brought him was his life partner and wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Among the clever and interesting people gathered there were the <name>Macdaniel</name> family, consisting of a widowed mother with her <num value="3">three</num> children, <num value="1">one</num> son and <num value="2">two</num> daughters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>They were from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, where the family was long settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>They brought with them an air of refinement which always characterized them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The youngest member of the family was <persName n="Eunice,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00057.00323" reg="mostcommon:Eunice,nomatch:0"><surname>Eunice</surname></persName>, an attractive and spirited girl, with black and sparkling eyes, and a slight but erect and energetic figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>If her mind had dwelt in the form of a man, it must have been regarded as a notable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>It impelled her to do her full part not only as a member of the community, but in the long and beautiful life to which it introduced her as a wife and mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>During her stay at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>, she is said to have had serious intentions of becoming an actress, but notwithstanding this somewhat romantic purpose, she was not unmindful of the practical affairs of life, and became an efficient member of the housekeepers' group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Whether from the experience she gained in that way, or from her natural aptitudes, she became famous in her married life as <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished housewives of her time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>She was from the <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a self-centred person who knew her own powers, and formed her own opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>In due time she won the admiration of <persName n="Dana,,Charles,,," id="n0179.0004.00058.00324" reg="default:Dana,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName>, who offered her his heart and hand with all his worldly goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>As has been seen, he was far from rich, but this was no bar. Fortunately even in those days money counted for little, while character was regarded as a matter of prime importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>They were married at <address><street n="Walker Street 39">39 Walker Street</street></address>, New York, on <dateStruct value="1846-03-02"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="2">2</day>, <year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>This, it should be noted, was the day before the <name>Phalanstery</name> was burned, and satisfactorily accounts for the fact that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00058.00325" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was not at the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>With their lives linked by the sacred ties of husband and wife, and having as yet no permanent home, they were literally compelled to go forth into the world to meet such fortune as life had in store for them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>He had a firm, expressive face, regular and clear-cut, a scholar's forehead, auburn hair, and a full beard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Strong in mind and general physique, he conveyed the impression of force, whether he moved or spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>In his old age he preserved a look of virility and determination, though hardheadedness clearly predominated over graciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>He was, at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>, kindly mannered, and gave a pleasant impression to those who met him, while a natural dignity kept him from many of the extravagances into which some of the others easily fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>He showed a taste for tie farm-work, which later, when success gave opportunity, grew into a fondness for live-stock and all the accompaniments of a country life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>An admirable nervous and muscular strength explains much of <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00058.00327" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s capacity for successful work.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Some <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before he had made an arrangement to write for the <rs>Boston</rs> <hi rend="italics">Daily Chronotype</hi> for <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">four dollars</measure> per week, and now that <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> had failed him, this small weekly compensation was his main dependence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>With the expense of a young wife added to his own it was pitifully inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>He doubtless contributed <quote>pot &mdash; boilers</quote> to other journals, but withal he was face to face with the necessity for a new departure, and made haste to abandon idealism and associationism for the more practical if less romantic struggle that was before him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>After the failure of <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> had deprived <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00059.00330" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> of steady occupation, he sought and obtained closer relations with the <hi rend="italics">Chronotype</hi>, and was formally employed by its owner and editor, <persName n="Wright,,Elizur,,," id="n0179.0004.00059.00331" reg="default:Wright,Elizur,,,"><foreName>Elizur</foreName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>, to read the exchanges, edit the news, and make himself generally useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>The newspaper was an orthodox publication, and was therefore a great favorite with the <rs>Congregational</rs> ministers of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>As an evidence of the young writer's independence of thought, and of his radical departure from the gloomy doctrines of <persName><foreName>Calvin</foreName></persName>, as well, perhaps, as an instance of his growing sense of humor, <persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00059.00334" reg="nearbymention:Wright,Elizur,,,"><surname>Wright</surname></persName> used to relate the following anecdote with evident satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>On the occasion of a temporary absence from the city his paper came out <quote>mighty strong against hell,</quote> t the astonishment of the subscribers as well as of the responsible editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>In referring to this incident years after <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00059.00335" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> had come to be a great editor, <persName n="Wright,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0004.00059.00336" reg="nearbymention:Wright,Elizur,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName> said it gave him a great deal of trouble at the time, as it obliged him to write a personal letter to every Congregational minister in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and to many of the deacons <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> besides, explaining that the paper's apparent change of doctrinal attitude was due to no change of faith on his own part, but to the fact that it had been left temporarily in charge of <quote>a young man without journalistic experience.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>It has been seen that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00060.00337" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> had already made the acquaintance of <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0179.0004.00060.00338" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, who was fast becoming, with his <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> and his facile pen, <num value="1">one</num> of the most influential men in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>This sympathy was doubtless the initial influence which led to <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0004.00060.00340" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s connection with the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, and to the long personal and professional intimacy which grew up between these remarkable men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>As can well be imagined, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0005.00061.00342" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was not long in reaching the conclusion that the journalistic field of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> was not likely to afford him a sufficient opportunity for the exercise of his talents or to yield him a sufficient income for his growing necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Accordingly he decided, late in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, to remove to New York, and through <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0179.0005.00061.00343" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, whose acquaintance he had made <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> before, he secured employment as city editor of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> at <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> per week to start with He began work in his new position in <dateStruct value="1847-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, but before the year was out he realized that his income was insufficient and felt compelled to strike for a higher salary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Inasmuch as he had not only shown his usefulness, but had attracted attention to himself as a journalist of unusual talents, <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0179.0005.00061.00344" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> promptly yielded, and advanced his assistant's pay to <measure n="14dollars" type="currency">fourteen dollars</measure> per week, while his own as chief editor and proprietor was only a dollar more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>After this advance <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0005.00061.00345" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> gradually became completely absorbed in his work on the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, and was therefore forced to terminate his engagements with other newspapers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Just what articles he wrote at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, or what class he preferred to write, is not known, but as he was full of energy, exceedingly intelligent, and widely <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> read for so young a man, it may be fairly assumed that he took a hand in every important question before the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>As he was in later days often heard to declare, he had already come to regard the world as a <quote>mighty interesting place,</quote> and nothing which concerned it at large, or his own country in particular, could well be a matter of indifference to him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>It had been a desire of <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0005.00062.00346" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s during the whole of his student life to travel in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, especially in <placeName key="tgn,7000084" n="1.000 7" reg="germany">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>He was greatly interested in the language, literature, and philosophy of that country, and wished above all things to broaden his acquaintance with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Fortunately the political discussions which began in <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, culminated in <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>, and finally ended nearly <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century later in a federated <name>German</name> empire, afforded him the opportunity he was so anxiously looking for. The wish to go abroad was strengthened by the fact that a revolution had broken out in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName>, which ended in the expulsion of <persName n="Philippe,,Louis,,," id="n0179.0005.00062.00347" reg="default:Philippe,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Philippe</surname></persName> and the establishment of a republic with <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n0179.0005.00062.00348" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> as president.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>In view of this troubled condition of affairs, his desire to visit <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> became irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>He therefore told <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0179.0005.00062.00349" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> frankly he wanted to go.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>The bourgeoisie, who were, then as now, the well-to-do middle class, having capital, factories, and shops, were disgusted with the idleness, confusion, and violence which prevailed, and while it naturally disapproved of the government's well-meant but misdirected efforts to find work for the unemployed, gave ready and effective support to its efforts to suppress insurrection and violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Indeed, the conservatives of every class became so incensed at the idleness which prevailed on every hand that they openly favored the extermination of the hungry and insurgent proletariat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>The government, although established by the revolution, with absolute control of the army, gathered about itself all the elements of conservatism, the royalists, the imperialists, the constitutional republicans, the conservative socialists, and the non-partisan bourgeoisie, and made common cause against the insurgents, killing in a few days as many as <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>This proposition was debated with <quote>agitation.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>Of positive results it has little to show-nothing in comparison with the evils by which it has been attended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>This impulse is everywhere in new and more vigorous life, in all countries of Europe-even in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/><gap/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> civilization is at a most important crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>It has attained its maturity and the process of decay has begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>At the same time the germs of better things, or a new social order, are appearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Has civilized <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> vitality enough to develop the new forms before it is crushed in the downfall of the old?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>Is there intelligence, love of justice, and love of man enough in these nations to anticipate and obviate the decay?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>This is the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>The antique civilization also reached its climax and then perished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>It is for us to take a lesson from its fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>It perished because it was based on slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Other causes were concerned in its destruction, but this was the primary <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>The basis of the social structure is industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>If there is wrong in the relations of industry-that is, of property and labor &mdash; the time will arrive when they must be reformed, or the whole structure will go to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>For a time slavery served a useful purpose in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Roma, Roma, Lazio" key="tgn,7000874">Rome</placeName>, but at last society reached a period when slavery must be put away and labor recognized in a more just manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>This necessity was not understood; the men of the time were not equal to it, and nations great in philosophy, art, poetry, and war were swept away by progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>The same necessity is at hand now. Under the existing system of labor, <orgName n="Modern Society" type="society">modern society</orgName> has reached the utmost development which that system will allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>New methods of industry must be established, as much superior to the wages system as that is superior to slavery, or else the doom will be pronounced and executed....</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>Moreover, it should not be forgotten that the civilization of modern times is fortified against an overthrow as that of the antique world was not; the railroads, the steamships, the manufactories, the wealth more abundant and more generally divided, which exists now, are so many substantial guarantees that society is to go forward to higher forms without the sad necessity of beginning the circle anew with barbarism and ignorance for its elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Nor is the reform now to be achieved so difficult as that for the lack of which the Old World <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> went to ruin, for the injustice and imperfection out of which labor must be elevated are not so great, while the humanity and intelligence are vastly greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>And apart from these considerations there is reason to believe that the necessary change is now slowly going on. The practical movement of labor reform is wider and profounder than is generally imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>The principle of co-operation is surely, I believe, supplanting that of competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>Here in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> there are now in operation some <num value="50">fifty</num> associations of workmen, and they are springing up in other places also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>Some will not succeed, it is likely, others are already brilliantly successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>This concludes a series of letters far the most numerous and interesting <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0006.00091.00445" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> ever wrote, except those covering the <rs>Civil War</rs> in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>From the extracts incorporated into this narrative, which show him to have been at least a consummate reporter, it is evident that he was a spectator of many of the transactions which he described, that he was frequently admitted behind the scenes, and that in all cases he must have had excellent sources of information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>The facts described by him may, therefore, be relied upon as correctly stated, and while in the light of the half-century or more which has elapsed since his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, it is evident that he wrote rather with regard to cause than to persons &mdash; more from a moral and speculative than from an economic or strictly philosophical point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>Many of his conclusions have not yet been realized, but it must be conceded that they are founded on principles, if not on fundamental facts, which command our sympathy if not our approval, especially when he assures us, as he does in terms of singular eloquence, that: <pb id="p.92" n="92"/> <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>His mind was ever on the alert to detect the real drift of things, and while it may be truthfully said that he was by nature an optimist in regard to the purposes and tendencies of humanity, and not infrequently overestimated the strength of the forces working for progress, or underestimated those which were working against it, he rarely ever failed to lend the whole weight of his influence to the cause which enlisted his sympathies or appealed to the nobler sentiments of our common nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Shortly after his return to this country he prepared and published in the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> a review of socialism, and of certain practical associative movements in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in which he contended that the so-called <quote>Red Republicans,</quote> while somewhat given to violence both of feeling and expression, were neither so blood-thirsty as their name seemed to indicate, nor so wicked as to favor the restoration of the guillotine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>They wanted a radical change in the relations of capital and labor, with better wages and conditions for the latter than they had yet been able to obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>To this end they had exerted their influence to induce the <orgName n="National Assembly" type="assembly">National Assembly of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName></orgName> to vote <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num> francs in aid of such industrial associations as might require capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Of this sum only <num value="1799000">1,799,000</num> francs were lent out to <num value="32">32</num> associations, <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> of which <num value="19">19</num>, receiving an aggregate of <num value="590000">590,000</num> francs, were at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>The rest were from the near-by country provinces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Of these <num value="132">132</num> were conclusively rejected for <num value="1">one</num> reason or another, but mostly because they did not come within the terms of the law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>The rules, regulations, working hours, conditions of the trades, and the division of the profits were explained without reservation, and in many cases he received such favorable impressions as seemed to justify the desire for fuller information, but unfortunately <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0006.00093.00448" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s stay abroad was too short to permit an exhaustive study of these interesting experiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>So far as can be ascertained, he did not follow them up after his return home, and the probability is their success, however promising at the time, was partial and short-lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>The absence of sufficient capital to meet the growing requirements of the undertakings, and of an efficient and continuous management with an equitable and certain division of the profits, to say nothing of competition, must have proved fatal to these associations, as they have to every similar undertaking from that day to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>And so far as <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0006.00093.00449" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> is concerned, these results only go to prove that the world was not sufficiently advanced to accept the theories, or to share the confidence on which they were founded. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>True to his convictions, he pointed out, then and frequently afterwards, that the remedy for such injustice as existed should be looked for in <quote>association,</quote> or <quote>cooperative carpentering,</quote> but he failed to indicate the essential difference between his plan and that of the strikers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>It doubtless lay in his belief that it was then and always the inherent right of every carpenter to stay out of the association, or to join it, just as he pleased, without coercion or any other infringement of his personal liberty or restraint upon his perfect freedom of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>Be this as it may, it will be seen as we proceed that this is the fundamental principle upon which <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0007.00101.00501" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> always acted to the close of his life, whether the strike was against himself or against others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>About the same time, although strongly in favor of temperance in the use of intoxicating liquors, he took ground against absolute prohibition, and suggested instead such a tax upon the liquor-sellers as would reimburse the public for all the loss it might sustain from the traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>While this cannot be claimed as a suggestion of the modern high license, as it has come to be applied in many States and communities, it evidently contains the germ of that measure, and is noticeable as <num value="1">one</num> of the best as well as earliest solutions of a question which remains open to the present day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>As might have been supposed, the discussions of the slavery question led to much excitement, and occasionally to disturbances in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, where slavery had many apologists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>It was no uncommon thing for ignorant and intolerant partisans to interfere with antislavery meetings, especially where the speakers were orators of such prominence as <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0179.0007.00101.00502" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,:2"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0179.0007.00101.00503" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,Wendell,,,:1"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Lovejoy,,,,," id="n0179.0007.00101.00504" reg="mostcommon:Lovejoy,Owen,,,:1"><surname>Lovejoy</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>He regarded this as <num value="1">one</num> of the inalienable rights of American citizenship, and stood for it to the day of his death, strenuously and without flinching, not only for himself and every other man as a man, but for himself and every other editor as an editor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>In later years he was forced to appeal to the courts for personal protection against the violation of this fundamental principle, and, as I shall relate in its proper place, fortunately won <num value="1">one</num> of the most important legal victories that has ever been accorded to an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>It is to be observed, however, that the compiler's modesty was too great to permit him to include even <num value="1">one</num> of his own poems within its ample limits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>The success which crowned this work from the start soon led to another and far more ambitious undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>Like <persName n="Diderot,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00158.00774" reg="mostcommon:Diderot,nomatch:0"><surname>Diderot</surname></persName>, who compiled the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encyclopaedia worthy of the name, he was undoubtedly at that time among the very few men of his country qualified for a work of that character, and this his publishers were not slow to recognize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>It was a work of considerable magnitude, requiring not only much capital, but the co-operation of many brains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>It necessarily involved the organization of a staff of associate editors, revisers, and contributors covering the entire range of human knowledge, and especially of history, science, art, and literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>It might properly be said that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00158.00775" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was already fully employed as managing editor of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, and, as has been shown, he was also devoted heart and soul to the war against the spread of slavery; but he did not hesitate to take on this new task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume was published in <dateStruct value="1858--"><year reg="1858">1858</year></dateStruct>, and the rest followed at regular intervals till <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, when the last was completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>It was, of course, criticised by specialists, but in <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> spite of the hard times it proved to be a great success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>It was thoroughly revised in <dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">76</year></dateStruct> by the original editors, aided by many additional writers, and may still be regarded as the principal American work of its time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>As might be supposed, his receipts from the copyright on these works, although intermittent, proved to be an important addition to <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00159.00777" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s income.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>He had become a shareholder in the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> on his return from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, and his salary as managing editor had been increased <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to <num value="25">twenty-five</num>, then to <num value="40">forty</num>, and finally to <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> per week, so that his earnings, his dividends, and his copyrights enabled him and his family to live in great comfort, if not in luxury, till the outbreak of the war between the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>With the large amount of literary and journalistic work which he carried on, especially for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> prior to his separation from the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, it may be fairly assumed that he found but little time for actual composition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>As a matter of fact, he did less and less editorial writing himself, and what he did becomes more and more difficult from this time on to identify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>Here and there a trenchant paragraph or a short editorial summing up an argument which had been carried on mainly by others, or <quote>putting the cracker</quote> to an article sent in by a member of the editorial staff, was the extent of his daily contribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>His work, like that of a skilful general, was rather in planning the campaign, making the orders and assignments, and seeing that the various movements conformed to the plans of the day, than in doing all the fighting himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>To the selection of his correspondents and his regular contributors he gave his personal attention, and to the very end displayed unusual skill and uncommon judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>While managing editor of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> he acquired the habit of making up the daily paper, and his remarkable skill in this part of the work was conceded by all. <pb id="p.160" n="160"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>The <hi rend="italics">Tribune's</hi> main contention, as already stated, was that slavery should not be interfered with in the <name>States</name> where it legally existed, nor should it be carried into or be established in any territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>This doctrine had been adopted by the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and that party was growing rapidly throughout the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and consequently the <rs>Southern States</rs> were becoming more and more apprehensive of the outcome of the discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>Their representatives gave repeated warning that the triumph of the <rs>Republican</rs>, or Black <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, as they preferred to call it, would be followed by the secession of the slave States and the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>; but the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> was incredulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>While it deprecated and derided such threats, it asserted its right and its intention to continue the discussion till the question was settled.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>As the discussion progressed and the excitement became greater and greater, <num value="2">two</num> currents of thought starting from a common basis began to show themselves in the columns of the paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>Both were unrelenting in hostility to slavery and the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, but while <num value="1">one</num> showed a disposition to admit the possibility of peaceable secession, the other stoutly contended that the <rs>Union</rs> was in its very nature indissoluble, and must be maintained in its integrity at every cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>That the former reflected the personal views of <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00160.00780" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, and for a time became the policy of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, cannot be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>It is equally certain that the latter embodied the opinions of <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00160.00781" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>, and ultimately became the dominant note of the <rs>Union</rs> men everywhere, whether they belonged to the <rs>Republican</rs> or to the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>. <pb id="p.161" n="161"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1681"/>Without attempting an elaborate analysis and comparison of the characteristics of these notable men, enough has already been quoted from their writings to show that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00161.00782" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was the more virile and vigorous of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1683"/>His nerves were steadier, his muscles harder, his vision clearer, and his capacity for work greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1684"/>There is reason to believe that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00161.00783" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> stood with <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00161.00784" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> in resenting the treatment of the latter by <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00161.00785" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:2"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> and <persName n="Weed,,,,," id="n0179.0011.00161.00786" reg="mostcommon:Weed,Thurlow,,,:1"><surname>Weed</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>Certainly I do not seek any such place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>I greatly prefer my position as <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, and would indeed prefer to that a private station could I now honorably retire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>For, of the great objects which <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> constrained me into <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> political life, <num value="1">one</num>, the overthrow of the slave power, is now happily accomplished, and the other, the denationalization of slavery and the consequent inauguration of an era of constitutional enfranchisement, seems sure to follow; so that I do not feel any longer that I have <quote>a mission,</quote> and therefore allow myself to grow somewhat weary of the harness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>But for the present I cannot get unyoked, and must work a while longer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>And I greatly prefer to work in a legislative than in an administrative position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>It is more pleasant on many accounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>Still I do not say that I would refuse the post you refer to. Indeed, it would be rather superfluous to decline what has not been offered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>Neither do I say I would accept it; but only this: that if the offer were made, without any urgency on the part of my friends, under circumstances otherwise agreeable to me, I should feel bound to consider it honestly and carefully with the help of the best advisers I could consult, and should be governed in my decision, not so much by my personal inclination as by my obligation to the cause and its true and faithful friends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>It was apparent to me that the scheme had not yet embodied any such partisan support as could carry it through Congress, and that it could easily be pushed aside and be rendered harmless, if the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> should not in its zeal accept and assume the false issue it tendered, and so drive the <name>Democracy</name> into Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>I felt on the other side the embarrassment which might result from a manifest disinclination to meet so plaguy a proposition boldly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>But our Northwestern friends told me, what I knew instinctively to be true, that to suffer the issue to go out as the <name>Democrats</name> had expected it to be made up would be disastrous to us in their part of the <rs>Union</rs>, What was done finally was in full consideration and agreement, and entirely satisfactory to all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>When the subject comes up again we must meet it as we best can. We are anxious to draw out some Southern opposition, and this may be expected, if we do not too readily and selfishly appropriate the resistance to it to our own party uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>I think ridicule, not pure argument, the most safe and effective way of disposing of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>The editorial was an important <num value="1">one</num>, and may be summarized as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/><persName n="Stanton,,Edwin,M.,," id="n0179.0012.00183.00924" reg="default:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><foreName>Edwin</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> yesterday (<dateStruct value="1862-01-20"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="20">20</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>) entered upon the full discharge of his duties as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>He was formally presented to the army officers on duty in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, who received him with cordiality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>They <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> shared the conviction that his appointment marked a new epoch for the <rs>Union</rs>, and would not be popular with the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1946"/>No man ever entered upon the duties of his high office under more favorable auspices &mdash; in all the loyal States there was no dissent &mdash; the claim that it was a concession to the border States was unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1947"/>The simple truth is that he was appointed in the interest of no section or preconceived policy, and with no reference to his views on slavery, but solely for <quote>the unqualified and uncompromising vindication of the authority and integrity of the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>It was confidently predicted that he would <quote>walk straight on in the path of duty,</quote> with <quote>remarkable energy and vigor,</quote> free from dictation <quote>from the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>,</quote> that he would adopt <quote>no hasty and ill-advised plans</quote> for assuming the offensive, nor become <quote>a harsh critic or lordly superior</quote> to the commanders in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>Special attention was called to <quote>the treason which skulks and plots within our lines</quote> --among the clerks and officers of the various departments, and especially in the patrician houses and social circles of both <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and among the clergy and people throughout the district east of <placeName reg="Chesapeake Bay, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7013592">Chesapeake Bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>While the nation might bear with the social and ecclesiastical exhibitions of disloyalty and spite which were of daily occurrence, it could no longer permit the open and clandestine communications with the enemy which had made known the government's most secret plans for the last year almost as soon as they had been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>The article denounced such disloyal practices in unmeasured terms, and pointed out that it was specially the business of the new secretary to put a stop to such <quote>flagrant treachery,</quote> urged him to watch the officers who expressed their apprehensions that <quote>the war for the <rs>Union</rs> was about to be perverted into a war upon slavery,</quote> and to ferret out and arrest <quote>the correspondents and counsellors of the rebel generals across the <rs>Potomac</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/><pb id="p.185" n="185"/></p> 
<p>But not satisfied with this, it urged the new secretary to turn his attention next to such jobbers and peculators as might be suspected of robbing the government at this crisis in the sale of horses, arms, provisions, clothing, or military munitions, and in every case to visit the guilty rascal with the most summary punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>It concluded with the statement: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>While this and other editorials may appear, <num value="0.5">a half</num>-century later, to have been unnecessarily harsh in their epithets and expressions, it can scarcely be denied that they were called for by a condition of affairs which seriously embarrassed the government and which fully justified the adoption of the most drastic measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>It is personally known to me that many important persons were involved directly or indirectly in these rascalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>But this was not the only case of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>Nearly every other branch of the army supply business was permeated by fraud, and what made it more difficult to deal with was the fact that some of the most competent and most energetic contractors were the most dishonest.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>On the whole this work was carried on with increasing success, so that long before the end of the war supplies of all classes were secured fully up to contract and specifications, and the wants of the army were filled with promptitude and liberality never surpassed in any country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3101"/>When he yielded to them, it was because they convinced him that they were right-never because he wished to avoid responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3102"/>In their judgment much was imperfect in the administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3103"/>They were frequently impatient with the <rs>President</rs>, but he was never so with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3104"/>Calm, equable, and uncomplaining, he was always considerate, pleasant, and cordial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3105"/>He was never in a hurry, and never tried to hurry any <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3106"/>In every discussion, even in every joke, he showed the profoundest thought and the most matured wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3107"/>It was his word that went at last, and his decision that closed every argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3108"/>His authority, his reserve force, and his gigantic frame were most impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3109"/>There was nothing flabby or feeble about him. With tremendous powers of endurance, he worked every day, and every night when necessary, as though he had done nothing the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>With a smile as engaging as that of a woman, there was such a charm and beauty about his expression, such good-humor and friendly spirit looking from his eyes, that you never thought whether he was awkward or graceful; you thought of nothing except what a kindly character this man has-how benevolence and benignity were combined in his appearance-how intelligence and goodness were combined in his character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>You felt that here was a man who saw through things, who understood things, and was entitled to your respect accordingly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>This is in substance <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00314.02233" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s estimate of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00314.02234" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as a president and as a man, but, high as it is, he thought him still higher as a politician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>Indeed, he regarded him as easily the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> American in that class, and mainly because he had an extraordinary knowledge of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>He appears to have taken <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00314.02235" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> into his inmost confidence in such matters during the earlier months of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, and to have consulted him fully about the amendment to the <pb id="p.315" n="315"/> Constitution to legalize the abolition of slavery, about the admission of <placeName reg="Nevada" key="tgn,7007526">Nevada</placeName> as a State, and generally about where to get the necessary votes in Congress to carry through the various policies of his administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>It was a matter of prime importance that the leading newspapers should give him their support, that <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02236" reg="mostcommon:Greeley,Horace,,,:10"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02237" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,James,Gordon,,:2"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName> especially should not oppose his measures; and to this end he frequently consulted <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02238" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>, who was a newspaper man himself, and knew them well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3116"/>In his capacity to control men, or to neutralize their opposition, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02239" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was without a rival, and made no mistakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>The unerring judgment, and the consummate patience with which he acted when the time arrived, constituted a quality which, so far as <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02240" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> knew, had not been exhibited to a higher degree by any other man in history, and which proved him to have been intellectually <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest of rulers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>Another interesting fact which <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02241" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Herr,,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to mention was that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0179.0019.00315.02242" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had finally developed into a great military man &mdash; that is, into a man of supreme military judgment.

From the day he took charge of it he made it an independent newspaper in the broadest sense of the words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>While it supported <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00404.03179" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> for the presidency, it wore the livery of no party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>While it discussed every public question and commented on the acts of every public man as occasion required, it must be admitted that it did so in no personal sense, but upon their merits alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>If the freedom of the press is essential to the freedom of the citizen, absolute independence of judgment on the part of the editor is not only his highest privilege, but his highest duty to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>As the future course of this narrative will show, the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> was never anything if not independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>In making it so, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00404.03180" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> estranged many friends, but while he <pb id="p.405" n="405"/> was not indifferent to their good opinions, as many supposed him to be, nothing turned him from the course he thought it his duty to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>He may not have been right always in the details of his statements or opinions, and probably cared but little for the mere appearance of consistency in what he said from day to day, but it is certain that he pursued the general course he had chosen with unfaltering constancy and fearlessness to the end. And it was by these virtues, commingled as they may have been from time to time with faults and errors of detail, that the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> soon came to be the most widely read and most frequently quoted newspaper of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>Its style was terse and vigorous, clear and luminous, from the start.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>Whatever was worth saying at all was worth saying well, and in language which no man could affect to misunderstand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>Statesmen, lawyers, preachers, professors, and educated men of every calling read it with avidity, and this fact made it possible, not only by its utterances, but by the persistency with which it reiterated them, to exert a tremendous influence upon every occasion in shaping public opinion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>On this hint we reminded him of a number he had not mentioned.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>I have related these facts with greater detail perhaps than necessary, because they led to many other conferences, <num value="1">one</num> of which at least was germane to this narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>Knowing that <persName n="Rawlins,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00406.03193" reg="mostcommon:Rawlins,John,A.,,:2"><surname>Rawlins</surname></persName> not only had great influence with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0179.0025.00406.03194" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, but as much interest in the success of his civil as he had had in his military administration, I talked with him even more fully than with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00406.03195" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> about both men and measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>We discussed the merits of many with whom we had become intimate during the war, and among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these was <persName n="Dana,,Charles,A.,," id="n0179.0025.00406.03196" reg="expanded:Dana,Charles,Anderson,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/><pb id="p.407" n="407"/> In consideration of the fact that he could not with justice to his own interests leave his newspaper, we concluded that the most suitable place for him was that of Collector of Customs at New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>Feeling that it was a wise decision, I made haste to communicate it both by letter and in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>Inasmuch as <persName n="Rawlins,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00407.03200" reg="mostcommon:Rawlins,John,A.,,:2"><surname>Rawlins</surname></persName> was at that time seeing <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00407.03201" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> daily, and discussing every sort of question with him, except such as were personal to himself, I assumed that they had considered and decided upon <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00407.03202" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s appointment together, and that <persName n="Rawlins,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00407.03203" reg="mostcommon:Rawlins,John,A.,,:2"><surname>Rawlins</surname></persName> had full authority for the assurance he had authorized me to give to <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0025.00407.03204" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>What or who caused this change of purpose has always been a matter of conjecture with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>Everybody understood it, and the press gave it the widest circulation, but the man who phrased it was a bold and fearless professional office-holder that could see no wrong in the words or in the use he had made of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4287"/>The Whiskey Ring was a corrupt combination for defrauding the <name>Treasury</name> of the excise levied by law on distilled spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4288"/>It doubtless had its origin in the need for money with which to pay the expense of national elections, though individual distillers and collectors had probably conspired to make <quote>crooked whiskey</quote> soon after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of Congress was passed providing for the collection of internal revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>It will be recalled that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0027.00451.03500" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was in early life inclined to the ministry, but gradually drifted away from the <orgName n="Orthodox Congregational Church" type="church">orthodox Congregational Church</orgName>, and greatly shocked his father by turning towards the <name>Unitarians</name>, with whose belief he was more in sympathy, not only because their fundamental ideas seemed more liberal and reasonable, but because many of his college associates and best friends in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> were connected with that body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4407"/>After removing to New York he became interested in the philosophy and speculations of <persName n="Swedenborg,,,,," id="n0179.0027.00451.03501" reg="mostcommon:Swedenborg,nomatch:0"><surname>Swedenborg</surname></persName>, and for years attended the <rs type="place">Swedenborgian Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4408"/>Later it is manifest that he left behind every form of belief based upon dogma, and inclined more and more to that Goethean indifference which he had mentioned in his youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>Although out of its chronological order, it may be well to relate here an incident bearing on this subject which took place early in the last year of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>With a look of intense concentration of thought, but without a moment's hesitation, he replied: <quote>Not a scintilla.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/>Of these vital ideas his socialism was the logical consequence; and the community at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> was the fruit at once of his democratic convictions and of his weariness with the unsatisfactory, unprofitable routine of conventional society as he found it <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago existing around him in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4432"/>The fundamental democratic doctrine of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and the doctrine of humanity as a living unity, they shared with him; his conclusions concerning the embodiment of democracy in new social forms they respected, but did not share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4433"/>His experiment they observed with interest and sympathy, but in its pecuniary and personal risks they took no part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4434"/>Indeed, no individual of distinction <pb id="p.454" n="454"/> joined in the enterprise except <persName n="Hawthorne,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0027.00454.03513" reg="mostcommon:Hawthorne,Nathaniel,,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hawthorne</surname></persName>, and he remained but a month or <num value="2">two</num>, investing a few <num value="100">hundred</num>, which he took care to recover by a lawsuit afterwards.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4436"/>But if this disaster had not occurred, it must presently have come to an end. The plan was too large for the means, the profits were insufficient, and the friction was too great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4437"/>It contained at the time about <num value="100">one hundred</num> inmates, including schoolteachers, mechanics, business men, farmers, and pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4438"/>In pursuance of the attempt towards a more just retribution for labor, all employments were paid substantially alike; and thus persons who in the world without could earn large salaries received no more than those who could only earn small ones; but the great difficulty was, that enough could not be earned for all the needs of the establishment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4442"/>In due time it ended and became almost forgotten; and yet it remains alive, and the purposes that inspired it still dwell in many minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4445"/>The same is doubtless true of others who were with him, and who have since been scattered in the ordinary plains and byways of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>It contended that, while the appointing power should be held responsible for the selection of its agents, it should be left free to exercise its own best judgment as to their qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>In reply to an invitation to attend a competitive examination at the New York custom-house, after stating the case in general terms as above, and allowing that every applicant for public office should be examined individually but not competitively for the work he wished to undertake, the editor continued as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>In my judgment a genuine reform of the evils complained of is reached by the rigorous simplification of the machinery of government, by the repeal of all superfluous laws, the abolition of every needless office, and the dismissal of every unnecessary officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4568"/>Later it discussed the <pb id="p.471" n="471"/> gold standard and the fall in prices, in connection with the decrease in the output of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>It quoted largely from the speeches of <persName n="Goschen,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00471.03612" reg="mostcommon:Goschen,nomatch:0"><surname>Goschen</surname></persName> and <persName n="Giffen,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00471.03613" reg="mostcommon:Giffen,nomatch:0"><surname>Giffen</surname></persName>, and did not hesitate for a brief period to favor silver monometallism, to be gradually brought about by the <rs>Treasury</rs>'s monthly purchase of <num value="4000000">four million</num> ounces of silver, as allowed by the silver purchase bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4614"/>The <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> has always maintained that railways and the improved methods of transportation are among the most useful and powerful agencies of American prosperity, and that in dealing with them and the abuses which have grown up in their management the people should never countenance measures looking to their ruin, their sequestration, or their acquisition by the general government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>It even went so far as to urge that Congress, having passed a law for the regulation of interstate commerce, and putting certain restrictions on the <rs>American</rs> railroads, owed it to them that it should prohibit all foreign railroads and steamship lines from engaging in the same trade as rivals to our own railroads and common carriers, just as foreign steamship lines are prohibited from engaging in the coasting trade as rivals to our own steamship lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>Taken in connection with the friendly comments that it made upon several of the gentlemen named for the new cabinet, it may be fairly regarded as foreshadowing a determination on the part of <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00478.03646" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> to judge the incoming administration entirely on its merits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>It was at this time that what appeared to many to be an indecent rush for office under the new administration brought from the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> a characteristic article favorable to politicians as a class, and deprecating the outcry against them as both thoughtless and unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>It contended frankly that, if a man wanted an office, he should ask the appointing power for it, with the same freedom that he would ask a business man or corporation for a job. This view of the matter was as novel as it was sound and healthy, and seems to have been accepted as all that needed to be said on the subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>But the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> was always opposed to the creation of new departments of government, not only because it did not want to see the government functions enlarged, but because it did not want the army of <orgName n="Federal office" type="office">federal office</orgName>-holders increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>While it acknowledged that the rapid growth of population, which was a phenomenon of the times, would necessarily result in a corresponding increase of the officeholders <pb id="p.479" n="479"/> in the <name>Treasury</name> and <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-Office</orgName> departments, it never lost an opportunity to argue against <quote>all annexes and extensions</quote> of federal power, the creation of <quote>new hospitals for office-holders,</quote> and the enlargement of governmental activity, no matter what the excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>For these reasons it objected to the creation of a <orgName n="Agriculture Department" type="department">department of agriculture</orgName>, or a department of commerce and labor, both of which were then under consideration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>It opposed the indiscriminate denunciation of trusts for political effect as <quote>the greatest humbug of the hour,</quote> and explained that <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>But while it held these views in regard to the nature and functions of trusts, and admitted that they should be subject to proper regulation by the power that created them, it also held that all trusts should be treated alike &mdash; that the commercial trusts should not be struck down while labor trusts and trades-unions should be allowed to carry on their operations without any regulation at all. True to its convictions, it always contended that neither labor trust nor trades-union should be permitted to deprive a private workman of his right to work at any time or place, or for any rate of compensation that might please him. It stood for the equal rights of all men before the law, and for the effective protection of every individual against the tyranny and violence of the many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>While <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00479.03647" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> had stood all his life for the rights of every class of labor, and for the betterment of its condition by all proper means, he <pb id="p.480" n="480"/> was the only prominent editor in the country who at all times stood firmly for the rights of the employer as well as of the individual workman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>The <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> was notably outspoken in its condemnation of the railroad and other strikers, not for leaving their job nor for demanding higher wages and shorter hours, but for the injury they inflicted on the property of their employers, and for the outrages and violence which they visited upon those who were willing to take the places they had vacated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>It will be remembered that the great strike at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, and the interference of the mob with the operation of the railroads engaged in interstate commerce, called forth a notable proclamation from <persName n="Cleveland,President,,,," id="n0179.0028.00480.03648" reg="nearbymention:Cleveland,Grover,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName> for the restoration of public order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>The occasion led to a correspondence by telegraph with the governor of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> that attracted much attention at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>Its immediate effect was to make it plain that the <rs>President</rs> required no call from him for assistance as a warrant for sending troops to disperse the mob and insure the free transmission of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>It was clearly his duty to see that all the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, including the act regulating commerce between the <name>States</name>, were enforced, that the government's mail service should be performed, and that to this end he should use, at his own discretion, such part of the army as he might think proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/>Troops were accordingly sent at once to <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, and to other parts of the country where the running of trains had been stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/>The effect was magical; the mobs were dispersed, their organization was broken, mail service was re-established, and order was everywhere restored.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>Upon all previous occasions, except in the case of receivers who were operating railroads under the orders of the federal courts, it had been regarded as the established law of the land that <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>This was a genuine surprise to the lawyers as well as to the business men of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>It marks an epoch in the protection of internal commerce and in the maintenance of public order and tranquillity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>He had been twice nominated and once chosen, and, although <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00481.03651" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName>'s term had intervened, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00481.03652" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> set his face strongly against <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> nomination, and went so far as to say that the greatest service that <persName n="Cleveland,,Grover,,," id="n0179.0028.00481.03653" reg="default:Cleveland,Grover,,,"><foreName>Grover</foreName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName> could now render to his party, or to his country, would be to put an end to the movement in his behalf.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>He had courage equal to every occasion; his given word needed no backer; his friendships and his enmities knew no variableness or shadow of turning; his opinions were never disguised nor withheld; his devotion to his country was without qualification; his faith in the future of liberty and democracy was neither intoxicated by their victories nor disheartened by their defeats; his intellectual resources were marvellous; his mind naturally adhered to the cause of <pb id="p.484" n="484"/> the poor and the weak, and his delight was to stand by the under dog in the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>Much of it was undoubtedly provoked by his unbridled manner of speaking about many things which most people held sacred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> years of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> the <rs>Catholic</rs> religion was the special object of his witty flings, and I cannot recollect in all literature anything more blasphemous and shocking than the expressions he frequently used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>It often seemed as if he were running amuck against the established ideas and usages of society, yet it was all done with such an affluence of wit, such surprising illustrations, and such a store of historical references that even those who were shocked by the wickedness were entertained by the manner of it; and thus the indifferent general public bought the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi>, and stood by its editor with a sort of indifferent sympathy which contributed to the steady increase of its popularity and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/>This he maintained under every stress and difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>No man but he controlled the <hi rend="italics">Herald;</hi> no mind but his inspired it. There were all sorts of stories about blackmail and <pb id="p.488" n="488"/> self-vengeance, to which he never made any reply, and I believe that they were all false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4721"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> of the proudest men in the world, and he scorned to defend himself against such imputations just as much as he scorned every suggestion which looked to his surrendering any opinion, purpose, or policy of his own.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>His support of slavery was undoubtedly <num value="1">one</num> of the points of popularity which made the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> strong with the business interests and the conservative sentiment of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>Now, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, he began to make room in the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> for arguments against slavery, and began even to write against the institution himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>These arguments were not like those of any other writer, but they were exceedingly efficacious, and this kind of qualified support was partially continued up to the nomination of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0179.0028.00488.03701" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>But it was never pushed to the point of entirely breaking with the <rs>Southern</rs> interest until after the <rs>Civil War</rs> began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>While giving to his profession always his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most faithful attention, he had a wide range of talents and interests outside of his daily occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/>It has been mentioned more than once that he had a great gift for language, which he rightly regarded as the depository of man's inner and spiritual history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>In studying words, he followed them through all their forms and mutations to their ultimate meaning, and in this found never-ending pleasure and instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4835"/>He showed beyond question that <quote>scrimmage</quote> was not only well established by immemorial usage, but was <num value="1">one</num> of the breeziest and most suggestive forms ever used to convey a meaning perfectly at home in every modern <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> tongue.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>The fact is that there were few men of his time not wholly devoted to the higher branches of study who better deserved to be called scholarly than <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00499.03749" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>He was always <pb id="p.500" n="500"/> a most industrious and methodical student, with an unusual gift for language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>It was doubtless to this gift, which he showed as a clerk in the <placeName reg="dry-goods store">dry-goods store</placeName> at <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, while acquiring a working knowledge of the <rs>Seneca Indian</rs> dialect, as well as of Latin, <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00500.03750" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, and Spanish, that he was indebted for his admission into <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> without a <quote>condition.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>It is also evident that he had a genuine thirst for knowledge, which, together with his aptitudes and tastes, gave special direction to his life-work and his career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>Blessed with an extraordinary memory, his wide reading gave him at an early age an encyclopedic knowledge of both ancient and modern literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>He began this practice in <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> with <persName n="Dante,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00500.03757" reg="mostcommon:Dante,nomatch:0"><surname>Dante</surname></persName>, and continued it with other classics almost without intermission to the end of his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>While those happy nights may have left but few memories laden with specific facts and details, they did much to develop the taste, broaden the sympathies, elevate the ideals, stimulate the affections and the friendship, and expand the understanding of those who took part in them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>In fact, all his work on the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>, in addition to his great and varied reading for by far the greater period of his life, was done solely by daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>From the time of his studentship, throughout his connection with the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Cyclopaedia</hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Household Book of Poetry</hi>, and the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, he rarely if at all taxed them at night, unless absolutely necessary, and then for the shortest possible period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>Those who were closest to him believe that in later life he hardly ever opened any book, except a dictionary or a book of reference, for the direct purpose of accumulating knowledge, but always for the interest he found in the idea or the art which it contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>With his extraordinary powers of concentration, aided by his capacity to take in a column or a page almost at a glance, he could absorb from what he read all that it contained of value in an incredibly short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/><pb id="p.502" n="502"/></p> 
<p>From the foregoing it may be fairly inferred that the outside public knew but little of <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00502.03763" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s inner life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>He rarely ever showed himself in public, except at the theatre or the circus, in both of which he took a lively and appreciative interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>In the earlier days of the bicycle he became an expert rider, and for several years got a great part of his exercise from its use. He spent by far the greater number of his evenings at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>With a strong, vigorous constitution, and an excellent digestion, he early became a gastronome and gourmet of excellent taste, and <num value="1">one</num> of his chief delights was to gather his friends about his dinner-table, where he entertained them with dishes and wines which were famous for their rarity and excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>Upon such occasions his wit was genial and kindly, as well as free from connection with current controversies, and never failed to stimulate that of his guests.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>In view of the aggressive and uncompromising tone of the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> in the discussion of public men and public questions, it was widely believed that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00502.03764" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> was a man of violent temper and of harsh and abusive language, but nothing could be further from the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>No man of his time had a more even temper or <num value="1">one</num> under better control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>He was not only calm and deliberate in all his actions, but clean, modest, and temperate in speech, as well as behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>Widely as he differed in his views and convictions from many of the public men of the day, he always spoke of them personally, if he spoke of them at all, in terms of moderation and charity, if not of respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>So far as his closest friends knew, he never mentioned even his bitterest enemy with heat or passion, or with unqualified disapproval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>If he could find an excuse for conduct he could not approve, it was sure to be a charitable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>He harbored no animosity, and always strove to separate private character and motives from official conduct, and, in condemning the latter, to reflect as little as possible on the <pb id="p.503" n="503"/> former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>In this he seemed to be a true philosopher, who regarded human actions as the direct consequences of influences and conditions over which the individual had but little control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>And nobody seemed to realize more fully than he that in our public affairs philosophy and the higher education play but an inferior part in comparison with the primal instincts and interests of every-day life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>He hoped and worked for the higher ideals and the nobler virtues of human nature, but recognized the fact that they were not always nor often the controlling influence in human affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>He was always found on their side, and yet never quite overwhelmed because they were sometimes forced to give place to baser considerations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>Music at his home, of which there was much for many years, was mainly classical, but this did not exclude a liberal and appreciative sympathy for what was beautiful in other schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>His taste in music was much the same as in poetry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>This was well shown by the monument erected, perhaps unconsciously on his part, to his own insight and appreciation of the poetical in <name>English</name> literature, as set forth in the <hi rend="italics">Household Book of Poetry</hi>. That compilation has been already mentioned as the model and precursor of many others intended like it to embody and illustrate the breadth and elevation of the poetic sentiment of the English-speaking people, and nothing could bear better testimony to the originality, the literary skill, and the thorough acquaintance of <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00503.03766" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> with the poetry of our language than the contents and arrangement of that book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>The selection, the classification, and the merit of the poems are not only admirable, but show an appreciation of art in poetry that no other compiler has ever attained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>For the artistic expression of imagination as found in <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> painting, <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00504.03767" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> had the most intense admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>To this, from the day it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attracted his notice, he devoted much of his spare time, and continued to do so with unabated interest throughout life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>It contained several of the most noted specimens of peachblow, a large number of <foreign lang="fr">sang de boeuf</foreign> and other rare and beautiful monochromes, and a bewildering assortment of decorated pieces of every shade and combination and of every classic form and every quality of paste, from the archaic celadon to the more modern and more beautiful <rs type="color">blue</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>, from the tiny snuff-bottle to the stately hawthorn vase, from the delicate egg-shell cup to the radiant ginger-pot of <foreign lang="fr">bleu de ciel.</foreign> It was a harmonious assortment of decorative colors and graceful forms, which appealed to the owner's sense of proportion and of beauty, and blessed his leisure hours with ever-varying combinations to the end of his life.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>It contains a large, old-fashioned frame house, in which he made his country home, and around which he created a fairyland of trees and flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>The natural beauties of the place were heightened by all the devices of the gardener and the arboriculturist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>To this end he brought rare trees from all parts of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>Many of his trees were noted for their perfection of form and foliage, which, added to the variety of the species found there, made Dosoris a place at which arboriculturists from all parts of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> were welcome, and to which many came to study as well as to admire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>For many years it is believed that no private place in the country afforded the journals devoted to such matters so many interesting subjects for illustration and discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>As there was nothing churlish or exclusive in <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00507.03778" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s nature, he took <pb id="p.508" n="508"/> as much pleasure in showing his trees and flowers to his friends and neighbors as he did in looking at them himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>As can well be understood, the place was a joy and a delight to those who visited it, and this was due quite as much to the geniality and intelligence of the owner, as to the beauties of nature and art which it gave him so much pleasure to exhibit and to describe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>It follows almost, of course, that a man of such diversified tastes and accomplishments, of such sane and enlightened occupations, must have been a man of rare personality, and such was the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>His love of finding interest for the mind in everything he did made the world a joy and a delight to him in all its parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>His body was as vigorous and healthy as his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>It was in harmony with all its surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>He was a strong and sturdy walker, an excellent swimmer, a fair boatman, and an admirable horseman, skilled in all the arts of the <quote><orgName n="High School" type="school">high school</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>He doubtless rode in boyhood, but he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> began to ride for exercise when his intimate friend Frederick Law <persName n="Olmsted,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00508.03779" reg="mostcommon:Olmsted,nomatch:0"><surname>Olmsted</surname></persName> was making <placeName key="tgn,1102739" n="1.000 7" reg="central park, manhattan island, new york">Central Park</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>In this art as in the others the ordinary and commonplace did not satisfy him. He wanted to be a master of it, and was fortunate in finding an old Spanish gentleman who was an accomplished horseman, and under whose instruction he worked as hard at both riding and training horses as he did at his other occupations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>With the close and intelligent application he gave to his daily lessons, he not only learned how to sit and handle a horse in motion with ease and satisfaction, but how to give him all the accomplishments necessary to fit him for the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>With the skill he acquired in breaking and training, he soon became an excellent judge of saddle-horses, and so long as he used them, generally had an exceedingly good <num value="1">one</num> in his own stable.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>From what has been said, it should be inferred that <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00508.03780" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName> had practically perfect health throughout life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>Even <pb id="p.509" n="509"/> such a thing as a headache or a rheumatic pain was unknown to him, and notwithstanding his exposure at times during the <rs>Civil War</rs>, he never had what could be called an ailing moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>Temperate and simple in his tastes and habits, he made no complaint of cold, hunger, or privation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>He was by nature disposed to make the best of what life brought to him, and to look not only calmly but confidently to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>He claimed but little for himself, but instinctively credited his fellow-men with good rather than bad motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>Suspicion was foreign to his nature, and although he was a man of high passion, strong enthusiasm, and vivid imagination, it would have been difficult to find among his contemporaries <num value="1">one</num> whose habit of thought and philosophy of life were marked by greater sanity or more evenly balanced judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>He did nothing from temper or passion, and adopted no course, either personal or official, unless it was approved by reason and reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>With a keen sense of humor and a disposition of unfailing cheerfulness, he was disposed to find fun in everything, and these qualities made him a delightful companion alike to young and old, and gave a special tone to his newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>They were ever present in his home life, where they made him the most intimate friend of his children and their companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>Indeed, it was <num value="1">one</num> of his most perfect gifts that he could adapt himself to the understanding and gain the confidence of the young as fully as of the old. Few parents ever lived in more perfect harmony with their children, and few children ever grew up in more perfect enjoyment and admiration of their father than was the case in <placeName><persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00509.03781" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>He played and worked with his son and daughters from their earliest days, not only helping them in their studies, but constantly supplementing and enlivening them with bits of information and learning, which they could not have gathered otherwise till later in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/><pb id="p.510" n="510"/></p> 
<p>A favorite entertainment with him was to have his children read aloud <name>German</name> fairy tales and folk songs, or short poems from the <rs>French</rs> in the original, and then, without previous preparation, translate them with his help into <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00510.03782" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>In this way they absorbed much that was charming at the time, and valuable thereafter, without effort, and without interfering with their regular study hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>No matter what might be the pressure upon him, he was always ready to help a child in its tasks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>The evenness of his temper, his great capacity for work, and the extraordinary efficiency of his faculties, made it impossible to hurry or disturb him either at home or at his desk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>These qualities gave to his character a balance and steadiness that shed a pleasant influence upon all who came within their reach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>It is the testimony of those who had an opportunity to know, that no office of any kind was ever more quiet, happy, harmonious, and well-governed than was the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> office under <persName n="Dana,,,,," id="n0179.0029.00510.03783" reg="nearbymention:Dana,Charles,A.,,"><surname>Dana</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>Every man in it fell unconsciously under the sway of his chief's personality, and from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> regarded himself as the respected and trusted servant of a master whose eye for what was praiseworthy was never shut, and whose quick and generous impulse was to recognize and reward merit and ability wherever he found them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>No newspaper at that time paid better salaries than the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>, and no better school of journalism ever existed in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>While the principal instruction was given by the blue pencil, it was so thorough and so effective that those who were fortunate enough to receive it soon came to be known to the press at large as <quote>the clever young men of the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>,</quote> and many of them now hold high and lucrative positions in journalism.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>His originality and success have been widely recognized throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and it is but just to add that he has been imitated as much in the make &mdash; up of <pb id="p.511" n="511"/> the newspaper as in the style of his own writing, or in that which he impressed upon his assistants and contributors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>It was as natural for him to run his pencil through words and phrases, to substitute other words, and to transpose paragraphs and expressions in the contributions of others as in his own. His constant effort was to clarify, to strengthen, and to condense for the purpose of bringing out the meaning of the writer, saving the time, and finding the line of least resistance to the understanding of the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>In all that was necessary to those ends he was an adept of transcendent ability, and yet much of what he did seems to have been done quite unconsciously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>When asked how he did it, he replied, <quote>When a man knows it he goes and does it.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>As his fame spread throughout the country, he was frequently called upon to deliver lectures, especially on the subject of journalism, and quite frequently accepted, but it is not known that he ever wrote out beforehand what he intended to say. Without being an orator, he was evidently able to think rapidly and clearly on his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>His delivery was not only deliberate, orderly, and consecutive, but unusually pleasing, if not eloquent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>He was happy as a <hi rend="italics">raconteur</hi>, and as his mind was stored with poetry, history, and anecdote, his most informal talks were always cheerful and interesting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>While it is by no means certain that he had in the earlier stages of his editorial career any established canons for the profession of journalism or the art of newspapermak-ing, it is evident that the true principles to be observed slowly framed themselves in his mind, and ultimately received definite form and consistency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>This was doubtless due in part to the fact that the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> was printed for many years as a single folio, given up almost entirely to editorials and the briefest statement of the news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>Having enjoyed extraordinary health throughout life, he naturally thought his trouble was a functional <num value="1">one</num> which would soon pass away, but in this he was disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>He was never informed as to the real nature and probable course of his ailment, and never asked; but those who were nearest to him never doubted that he had from the earliest consultation of his physicians inferred from their silence, rather than from what they said, that it was incurable and would after a few months prove fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>And this proved to be. the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>The patient indulged in no repining, but gave up work, and with the cheerfulness of a philosopher who had enjoyed life to the full resigned himself calmly to his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>He talked freely with his family and friends, showing no sign of revolt or trepidation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>In the earlier days of his retirement he gave his views as to the question of life <pb id="p.514" n="514"/> after death as already related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>He was calm, collected, and, if not cheerful, at least not overwhelmed by the shadow which was slowly darkening towards the end.

It is almost a subject of ancient history that we are going to consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>Few persons who are here can be familiar with the outlines of it, and there will naturally be a good many things that may be obscure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>Let these be made plain, if possible, as we go along.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>About <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago this country was the scene of an intellectual agitation that I do not think can be quite matched in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>It began with the antislavery movement, an attack upon an institution fortified by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and connected with the great commercial interests of the country, amounting in pecuniary value to I know not how many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars; and it naturally inflamed the passions of the people, particularly in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, where slaves were held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>This agitation was carried on with great intensity and fierceness of feeling on both sides, and with a terrible disturbance of the mind in almost the whole population of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>To be called an abolitionist was, in many places, almost the greatest stigma that could be put upon a man. He was accused of attempting to destroy the foundations of the republic; he was launching <pb id="p.518" n="518"/> us into an unknown and dreadfull struggle; he was appealing to moral sentiments when he questioned what affected more or less the property of the whole land; and the violence of the indignation which he roused was equalled only by the steadiness of his own purpose and his determination to stand by a movement based on the deepest foundations of human nature, and the feelings and the mind of every intelligent person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>That was a great agitation, but it was accompanied by many others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>They sprung up around it as a thicket of plants may surround a great tree.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>The antislavery agitation was carried on in <num value="2">two</num> ways principally: by public meetings, conventions, and lectures held in different parts of the country, and by the newspaper press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>The newspapers that were engaged in it at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> were very few. There were not many men who had the moral nerve to enlist in the mighty battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>The most conspicuous of them all was <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0179.0031.00518.03793" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and his principal associate was <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n0179.0031.00518.03794" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName>, also of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>They were objects on the <num value="1">one</num> side of great admiration and respect, and on the other side they were assailed with a degree of vituperation which I have never seen surpassed in any political contest or in any contest whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>They were mobbed; their meetings were broken up; they were assailed with every insult; they were sometimes in danger of being lynched, and harm of every sort was threatened against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>Nothing, certainly, but the most indomitable motives of conscience, and the clearest conviction of right and duty, could ever have carried them through their campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>Finally the question that they had raised was settled by war, and we can all remember the horrors of that awful, that bloody struggle, whose tremendous features were relieved only by the glorious circumstance that the final decision was in favor of freedom, that it struck the fetters from every slave, and that in consequence there is now in this broad land no such thing as bondage, no such thing as a man who is merely a chattel like the beasts that perish.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/>It was a genuine emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>It was accomplished by war. And when it was done even those most bitterly opposed to the abolition agitation joined in rejoicings at the <pb id="p.519" n="519"/> peace we had achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5008"/>I ought to say, however, that a great deal more of the credit for this crowning result of emancipation and liberty was due to the abolitionists than they have received, or perhaps ever will receive, even in the verdict of impartial history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>They did nothing directly to bring about freedom; they struck off the fetters of not a single slave; but they had awakened by their long labors, by their persistent efforts in the face of every obstacle, a moral sentiment which was active in the hearts of the whole country, and which, of itself, contributed much to the victory that right and liberty and conscience finally achieved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5010"/>While this supreme agitation was going forward, every other sort of agitation appeared along with it. Moral principles were evoked and attached to things that apparently had no relations to morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5011"/>Non-resistance was <num value="1">one</num> of these moral principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5012"/>It was wrong to use force, we were told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5013"/>The advocates of this theory averred that no government should stand on force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>If it is force that finally decides, where is your republican government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>We might as well have despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>Our ideal is a government of intelligence, of conviction, of conscience, and of moral duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5017"/>I remember that this party of non-resistance proved to be pretty large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/>Its doctrine was that you must never resist physical constraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5019"/>If a man struck you on <num value="1">one</num> cheek, turn the other to him; overcome evil with good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>Accordingly, there were many men, and men of bright intelligence and genuine culture, who refused to be a party in the operations of government, and who would not hold any office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/><persName n="Quincy,,Edmund,,," id="n0179.0031.00519.03795" reg="default:Quincy,Edmund,,,"><foreName>Edmund</foreName> <surname>Quincy</surname></persName>, in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most charming men I have ever known, rejected his commission as a justice of the peace, which <persName n="Everett,Governor,,,," id="n0179.0031.00519.03796" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName> sent to him, because he could not conscientiously hold any office the exercise of which implied the use of physical force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>Some of those moral standards which were set up at that time seem to us nowadays to have been fine-spun and unsubstantial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5023"/>I remember <num value="1">one</num> of my friends, the late <persName n="Alcott,Mister,Bronson,,," id="n0179.0031.00519.03797" reg="default:Alcott,Bronson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Bronson</foreName> <surname>Alcott</surname></persName>, a gentleman of distinction in his day, a philosopher and a writer of singular subtlety and elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5024"/><pb id="p.520" n="520"/> He came to the conclusion that the use of fire in cooking was wicked, that there could be no purity, nothing heavenly in food that was cooked by fire Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>Fire belonged in the other place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>Another of his notions, which several of his friends adopted with him, was that it was wrong to use sheeps' wool in making clothes, because nature gave the sheep its fleece for its protection and warmth, and if you shear off the fleece for your own purposes, you deprive this unresisting and helpless sheep of its natural clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>Therefore you ought not to do it; it was a sin. If you would go around in the field among the brambles where the sheep wandered, and gather up there the parts of their fleece which had been caught off by the twigs and branches, there would be no sin in making clothes of that sort of wool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>But to go into a shop and buy a piece of woollen cloth and have it made into a coat would be sinful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/>As for cotton clothes, they could not be worn because there was slavery in every fibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5030"/>The cotton was cultivated by slaves and gathered by slaves, and the man who put on any American cotton was compromising with slavery, and making himself a party to slavery, when he ought to repudiate slavery, spurn the devil and all his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5031"/>So they couldn't rightfully wear either woollen or cotton clothes, and had to take refuge in linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5032"/>I recollect I was driving along <num value="1">one</num> day in the winter when I came upon <num value="2">two</num> of these gentlemen dressed in linen garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5033"/>They had on overcoats, but they were of linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5034"/>They looked cold, and owned it, and said they were glad when I asked them to drive home with me. When dinner came they were perfectly willing to take seats with us at the table, but they wished us to understand beforehand that they had brought their own food with them, and that they could not take part in any banquet that had been prepared by fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5035"/>They had a bag of apples and a bag of uncracked wheat; and out of that, with a drink of plain water, they made their dinner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5036"/>Well, the whole country was full of just such ideas, such arguments, and some of them were sensible and some were not. There was another movement of real and profound importance that was going on at that time, especially in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and that <pb id="p.521" n="521"/> was what was known as the uprising of the <rs type="place">Transcendental school</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5037"/>It was a <orgName n="Philosophy School" type="school">school of philosophy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5038"/>It grew up in opposition to the philosophy which taught that there was nothing in the intellect that had not before been in the senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5039"/>The Transcendentalists maintained the doctrine of the orginal intuitions of the mind, and that the soul communes with regions that lie beyond the senses, and has intimations of divine truth that the senses cannot reveal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5040"/>Their school was very active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5041"/>There were men in it of great importance, men whose names remain in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5042"/>There was <persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00521.03798" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, perhaps the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man, in his famous discourse on nature, to declare aggressively in this country the doctrine of this Transcendental school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5043"/><persName n="Ripley,Mister,George,,," id="n0179.0031.00521.03799" reg="default:Ripley,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>, a Unitarian minister in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, was another advocate of it. He was a man of high education, immense knowledge, and of ability and courage equal to any man's. In this party of Transcendental philosophers the idea early arose &mdash; it was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stated by <persName n="Bancroft,Mister,George,,," id="n0179.0031.00521.03800" reg="default:Bancroft,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>, the historian, who sympathized thoroughly with the <name>Transcendentalists</name> &mdash; that democracy, while it existed in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, while it had triumphed as a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> under <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00521.03801" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, and while it was then in possession of a majority of the governments of the <name>States</name>, and at times of the government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was not enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5044"/>That was not the perfect realization of democracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5045"/>If democracy was the sublime truth which it was held to be, it should be raised up from the sphere of politics, from the sphere of law and constitutions; it should be raised up into life and be made social.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5046"/>The principle of equality, which allowed every man's vote to be as good as that of every other man, should be extended so that in society and in social life the same principle of equality should be applied throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5047"/><num value="1">One</num> of the things that these democratic philosophers particularly objected to was that while the master sat in the parlor up-stairs, the servant sat in the kitchen down-stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5048"/>They ought to be on the same level; equality and democracy should characterize our social relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>Every person &mdash; this was their teaching &mdash; should have an opportunity of education, so that all his faculties could be cultivated and developed, and all the avenues <pb id="p.522" n="522"/> of knowledge should be opened to every <num value="1">one</num> who desired to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5050"/>That could only be accomplished by the reform of society; and this reform of society these people, after long study and much discussion, determined it was their duty to realize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5051"/>And that was what inspired the socialistic movement which began about <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5052"/>It was not, as you will observe, akin in the least to the theory of which <persName n="Marx,,Karl,,," id="n0179.0031.00522.03802" reg="default:Marx,Karl,,,"><foreName>Karl</foreName> <surname>Marx</surname></persName> is perhaps the most celebrated advocate, the government socialism, in which the government owns all land and machinery, all means of manufacture, all the shops of industry, and the people are its employees and subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5053"/>On the contrary, the socialism of that day contemplated merely a system of associated living, of combined households, with joint stock ownership of the joint property; every stockholder to get his share in the profits, which he had helped to earn, and the share earned by the capital he had invested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5054"/>The idea of government monopoly in ownership was most repugnant to the theorists we are speaking of. Individuality and liberty were their cherished objects, and all forms of communism they zealously repudiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5055"/>Nor did the socialism we are considering start from the uneducated or the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5056"/>Its adherents were all people who had gathered in the fruit of the highest education, the fullest knowledge, the highest refinement that was known to <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName> in those times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5057"/>They were scholars, thinkers, clergymen, philosophers, men and women of eminence in literature and society; and when some of them began to discuss the problem of revolutionizing social life, of placing it upon a democratic platform, and of giving each man an equal chance with every other man, their movement naturally drew a great deal of attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>It was joked about in the newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5059"/>The newspapers were great in joking then, as they have been since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5060"/>They laughed at it and they prophesied that as every such undertaking of which they had a record had failed before, this would also fail and go out as a passing cloud, as a fancy that had no substantial reality behind it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>The idea of founding a society of associated families was strengthened considerably by the experience of the <name>Shakers</name>, <pb id="p.523" n="523"/> and this argument was constantly brought forward in the meetings of those engaged in studying the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5062"/>The Shakers were then of much more importance than they are now. I believe there were more societies of them, and they had the reputation of being rich as well as successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5063"/>They were all democratic in a certain sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>Every person had the same opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/>They had to obey a kind of ecclesiastical authority, and they lived in celibacy; but so far as the ordinary social relations were concerned, the <name>Shakers</name> were entirely democratic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5066"/>Then there began to be published at about this time the writings of an ardent enthusiast, an American from western New York named <persName n="Brisbane,,Albert,,," id="n0179.0031.00523.03803" reg="default:Brisbane,Albert,,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Brisbane</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5067"/>He had lived several years in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, especially in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, and there he had got acquainted with a man who was undoubtedly <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest theorists upon the subject of social institutions and social progress that has ever appeared &mdash; <persName n="Fourier,,Charles,,," id="n0179.0031.00523.03804" reg="default:Fourier,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Fourier</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5068"/>His system is complicated, but very remarkable and interesting, and well worth studying merely as a subject of intellectual scrutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/><persName n="Brisbane,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00523.03805" reg="nearbymention:Brisbane,Albert,,,"><surname>Brisbane</surname></persName> published several books in favor of Association, Industrial Association, <orgName n="Agricultural Association" type="association">Agricultural Association</orgName>, Co-operative Association, or, as he called it, the combined order of society, as distinguished from the order of separate households, each family living by itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>His arguments were very striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>In the first place, there was the economy of the new system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>You could lodge, feed, and clothe a <num value="1000">thousand</num> people in <num value="1">one</num> great, combined household much more cheaply than when each family had its own separate dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5073"/>Each family would have its own apartments, and his idea in some respects suggested such great apartment-houses as we now have in some of our large cities, where <num value="100">one hundred</num> families may live under <num value="1">one</num> roof, and yet have an independent style of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>His views were greatly strengthened in their influence by the adhesion of <persName n="Greeley,Mister,Horace,,," id="n0179.0031.00523.03806" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, then lately established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5075"/><persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00523.03807" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> embraced the associative doctrine very early and with great enthusiasm and zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/>He saw the economical advantages; he saw that a <num value="1000">thousand</num> people might live together and save money in a combined household, even when none of <pb id="p.524" n="524"/> them might have enough to live on separately; yet he did not profess to understand the philosophical theory of <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00524.03808" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,Charles,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>His advocacy had great weight, and for a long period the newspaper which <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00524.03809" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName> conducted, the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, set apart <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> columns every day, for which the editor didn't assume any responsibility, but which were conducted by <persName n="Brisbane,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00524.03810" reg="nearbymention:Brisbane,Albert,,,"><surname>Brisbane</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5078"/>That produced a great effect all over the country.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>Now, this new agitation took at once a very marked place in the moral discussions of that time, and in the social and economic discussions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5081"/>Not that it drew away from either of the other intellectual and moral movements; there were just as many abolitionists after it as before, and just as many non-resistants; but a great many people-very intelligent people-took up this idea of social reform and of the reorganization of society upon the associative basis, applying the principle of association to industry, to art, to education, to the whole round of humanity's social existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>Acting under this impulse a party of philosophers in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, after long study and deliberation, now determined to try the experiment of an association, though without any of the special features of <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00524.03813" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,Charles,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>'s system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5083"/>The same determination was reached in other places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/>There was a party in <placeName reg="Northampton, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014242">Northampton, Massachusetts</placeName>, which organized a small association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> begun by a Universalist clergyman, a most excellent man, <persName n="Ballou,Reverend,Adin,,," id="n0179.0031.00524.03814" reg="default:Ballou,Adin,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Adin</foreName> <surname>Ballou</surname></persName>, at <placeName key="tgn,7014395" n="1.000 1" reg="peace dale, washington, rhode island">Peacedale</placeName>, also in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>He was a non-resistant; so much so that I remember when a proposition was made to him, after several months, to combine his society with the <name>Transcendental</name> party that I have been speaking of, with <persName n="Ripley,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00524.03815" reg="nearbymention:Ripley,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName> and his associates, he emphatically declined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>The Transcendentalists said, <quote>Let us all go in together and put our resources together, then we shall be a good deal stronger and our chance of success will be increased.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>It was a very pretty piece of land, most excellently situated, well watered, and not a bad soil &mdash; a very eligible place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>They organized a society called the <rs type="place">Brook Farm Institute</rs> of Agriculture and Education, and began work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>This organization was conceived in Transcendentalism, and designed to carry on social life in accordance with democratic and <name>Christian</name> ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>There had been all the time a notable agitation respecting the unsanitary habits of college students, of people who pursued literature and learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>They used to sit in their studies and get no regular exercise, and had no life in nature; they did not go out in the free air and gain their livelihood by the sweat of their brows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>The argument was that while any <num value="1">one</num> was pursuing philosophy and literature and philology and mathematics, he ought to work on the land, to cultivate the earth; and the man who didn't work on the land could not have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>This was their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>So, in order to reform society, in order to regenerate the world, in order to realize democracy in the social relations, these friends of ours determined that their society should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pursue agriculture, which would give every man plenty of out-door labor in the free air, and at the same time the opportunity of study, of instruction, of becoming familiar with everything in literature and in learning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>So they began the <rs type="place">Brook Farm Institute</rs> of Agriculture and Education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>He had got tired of the routine of literary life in his study, and of the more tedious routine of official life in the <rs>Salem</rs> custom-house; and so he started in by advancing money towards buying the farm along the brook.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>A large majority of the <rs type="place">Brook</rs>-Farmers were literary people or of literary associations, but there were people of other callings among them, too. There was a pressman and a grocer, each with his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>Several had been farmers' <pb id="p.526" n="526"/> hired men. There was an English girl who had been a domestic, and a very superior woman she was. I also remember particularly an Englishman who came to <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> from his service as valet to an English baronet then staying in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>His name was <persName n="Cheever,,John,,," id="n0179.0031.00526.03821" reg="default:Cheever,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Cheever</surname></persName>, and he proved to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most entertaining members of the society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>He was very amusing, and always pleasant as a companion at table, for we all took our meals in the same room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>There was no social differentiation at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5109"/>They began operations with zeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5110"/>They planted their crops and cultivated them, and these studious men, whose hands were soft before, and who had never touched a ploughshare or a sickle in all their lives, now set to work as farmers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>As a result, their health was improved and they had a great deal of entertainment out of it. And the people who read the newspapers got some entertainment, too, because their doings and transactions were occasionally reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5112"/>I was not there, but I afterwards became <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5113"/>I broke down my eyes at <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, and candor compels me to say, however, that I didn't break them down studying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5114"/>I sat up a good part of <num value="1">one</num> night and read <hi rend="italics">Oliver Twist</hi> by candle-light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5115"/>The book was just then published, and was very badly printed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5116"/>When I got through I thought I would never see again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>It was <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5118"/>Well, in those days when a person broke down his eyes he had to try farming or else to go to sea---my cousin, <persName n="Dana,,Richard,Henry,," id="n0179.0031.00526.03822" reg="default:Dana,Richard,Henry,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName>, spent <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before the mast for that reason, and a noble book he made out of it. Some of my friends said to me, <quote>Now is your chance; go out to <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5119"/>So I went there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5120"/>I had known them well before, and they kindly took me in. After I had been there a month or <num value="2">two</num> I was elected <num value="1">one</num> of the trustees, and from that time out I was fully in the movement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5121"/>A great deal of romance has been written and more has been talked about the transactions at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5122"/>The city people who went there occasionally on fine summer days and walked over those beautiful fields where our philosophers were mowing or reaping, or those who stayed in the evening and attended <num value="1">one</num> of the literary conferences, which were often <pb id="p.527" n="527"/> held, were always much impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5123"/><persName n="Emerson,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00527.03823" reg="mostcommon:Emerson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName> came once or twice a year, and when he came there was a gathering in the parlor, and he would discourse, and some <num value="1">one</num> else would discourse, and others would ask questions, and there would be a discussion of some interesting literary or philosophical theme, and everybody listened with pleasure to this high debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5124"/>The same was the case when <persName n="Fuller,,Margaret,,," id="n0179.0031.00527.03824" reg="default:Fuller,Margaret,,,"><foreName>Margaret</foreName> <surname>Fuller</surname></persName> paid us an occasional visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5125"/>It was really delightful, and it gave a kind of character and reputation to the place that it never would have got from the more prosaic mowing and haying that went on there in the daytime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5126"/>Then the opportunity of education was open to everybody who belonged to the society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5127"/>Every person, member or member's child, paid so much for his board, and the <name>Greek</name> and Latin, the esthetic philosophy, the singing and dancing were thrown in. But the regular students who were not members paid, and some of them worked, too, because they liked it. I remember <num value="1">one</num> young gentleman from an aristocratic family in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> had the misfortune to get rusticated at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName>, and he was sent off for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure>. Well, he came to <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>; and I remember that some of his natural predilections developed themselves there as they had not before been able to do. <num value="1">One</num> of his passions was horses, and if he could get a horse to curry and brush down, his happiness was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5128"/>Nobody asked him to do it; he asked if he might, and he got the permission very easily, I assure you. So in the morning he would work an hour or more around the horses and then get his breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5129"/>In the afternoon, after he had done with his lessons, if he could drive <num value="4">four</num> oxen to plough, or if he could get a stout team of horses and go and haul in wood, he thought it was lovely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5130"/>He was never happier in his life than when he had on a long blue farmer's frock, and was starting off with his big cart after a load of wood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5131"/>So everybody enjoyed it. And it was really delightful, because there was this combination of intellectual occupations and out-door work; and the living, too, was pretty fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5132"/>It was not luxurious; it was fair; it was nutritious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5133"/>Everybody enjoyed it, and the thing went on beautifully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5134"/>Every <pb id="p.528" n="528"/> now and then some intellectual swell would come to pay us a visit, and he would hold a discourse or a conversation, and we were all delighted to hear him. It was like having a free lecture course every evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5135"/>But there was no communism about it. Individual liberty and independence were strictly guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5136"/>The only thing that had the appearance of communism was the common opportunity of education and a living at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5137"/>Nobody could get better board than all had, and access to the means of instruction was open to every <num value="1">one</num> alike; and there was a common compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5138"/>Each man got <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> a day, and each woman the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5139"/>That was passed to the credit of each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5140"/>Each <num value="1">one</num> paid for his board a certain amount; I think it was <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">two dollars and fifty cents</measure> a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5141"/>Woman stood on the same plane as the lords of creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5142"/>A woman in that society was just as good as a man, and sometimes a great deal better.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>But it didn't pay. We kept a good school, with a most extensive range of instruction, but we didn't have scholars enough, or get enough money from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>There wasn't enough money coming in. It wasn't exactly like an ordinary school, where the scholars sit around on benches and stand up when they are called on to recite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>Everybody there could begin in the morning, and stay until <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon if he liked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5146"/>Each pupil undertook to learn certain things, and those things he had to learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>His hours of recitation were regularly appointed, and he came knowing his lesson or else he was sent back to learn it. There was no absence of strictness in the mental discipline of the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>And yet it was a great deal freer than ordinary schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>If a young man wanted to go out and study his lesson under a tree, he had that privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>The air of freedom and democracy about the place was <num value="1">one</num> of its principal attractions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>But the needed income did not materialize, and after the experiment had gone on about <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, it was concluded that we were not likely to revolutionize the social system of the world in that way. Our design was good, and we were most seriously in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>I never saw a more determined purpose than that pervading our membership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>Here was the world suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>The same complaints <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> abounded that we hear now, but the great public did not come over to us. We were constantly getting applications for admission from families that wanted to come in, and we took them in if we thought best; but we hadn't accommodations, buildings, or the capital required for enlarging the establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>We concluded that the reason we were not succeeding as we should do, and as we had hoped to do, was that we were too weak, too poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>We also began to pay more and more attention to the works of <persName n="Fourier,,M.,,," id="n0179.0031.00529.03825" reg="default:Fourier,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Fourier</surname></persName>, the <rs>French</rs> writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>We concluded that if we could organize ourselves upon his system, which seemed to be getting adherents all over the country, we would be sure of making a greater impression on intelligent people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>If we could only apply his system we might be able to accomplish our absorbing desire for a universal social reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>We might thus do the duty that we felt was incumbent upon us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5160"/>So we determined to endeavor to apply <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00529.03826" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,M.,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>'s system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>That is a very complicated doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>A great point of it is that the troubles, conflicts, difficulties, and disturbances that exist in society are due to the fact that the soul of man isn't suited with such social institutions as now exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>Man was made to be a harmonious being, to live in harmony with his fellow-man; and life upon this earth was designed by the <name>Creator</name> to be a scene of happiness and joy, with no other reasons or occasions for suffering than the events of mortality and the occasional accidents or attacks of sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>How can a society be organized which will give happiness to man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>You must begin with a true analysis of human nature; you must find out what are the constant, the lasting needs of human nature, and you must organize society to meet those needs, to satisfy those wants; and in order to do that we must obtain a scientific knowledge of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>That is not set out in any current and received philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>There is no school that teaches the real constitution of the human soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>According to <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00529.03827" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,M.,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>, there are in the soul of man passions or affections and faculties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> kinds of these passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, there are the <num value="5">five</num> that bring man into relation with the outer world through his senses-sight, taste, touch, <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> smell, hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>Then there are <num value="4">four</num> social passions-namely, friendship, ambition, love, and the family affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>Then there are <num value="3">three</num> intellectual affections which distribute the harmonies of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>These are: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, the love of change-nobody wants to pursue any occupation longer than an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> or <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. The mind becomes tired and you need alternation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>The next is analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>That impulse takes a subject to pieces and finds out its parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>Then the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> is the composite or combining passion, the desire that takes the parts of anything which you have analyzed, and combines them in a new whole, as <persName n="Beethoven,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00530.03828" reg="mostcommon:Beethoven,nomatch:0"><surname>Beethoven</surname></persName> or <persName n="Handel,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00530.03829" reg="mostcommon:Handel,nomatch:0"><surname>Handel</surname></persName> combined and varied the notes of the octave in a symphony or oratorio, in which the whole is new, while the elements are all old and familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>Then, finally, in this system of metaphysics, the soul of man as a whole has an impulse towards unity, a passion for universal harmony, a religious passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>If, now, you arrange society in accordance with this analysis of the soul, if you combine all these elements, as a great composer combines the notes of the musical scale, you will have harmony, economy, joy, and delight, and life will be <num value="1">one</num> scene of continuous pleasure and continuous usefulness, greater, nobler, more elevated, more complete than man in this world has yet known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>Industry, instead of being monotonous, tedious, and repugnant, will be attractive, a source of pleasure and of artistic delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5180"/>That is the theory of <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00530.03830" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,M.,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName> stated in a most general manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>But it requires at least <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men and women, <num value="800">eight hundred</num> people, to apply this theory at all, and <num value="1800">eighteen hundred</num> to apply it thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>With fewer than that it is impossible to arrange this social symphony; also it requires a vast capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5183"/><persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00530.03831" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,M.,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName> labored all his life on the problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>He had few friends, apparently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>He was all his life publishing books of impressive eloquence, brilliant analysis, and indignant protest, and appealing to kings and millionaires to come forward and give him the <measure n="2000000dollars" type="currency">two million dollars</measure> which he found necessary to realize his theory and demonstrate to mankind that the millennium could now be begun and developed on the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>But he never found the backer he was looking for, and died without even beginning to illustrate his idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5187"/><pb id="p.531" n="531"/></p> 
<p>At the time of this new evolution in <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName>, there were several communities or associations in different parts of the country organized very much on our original plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5188"/>There was the <rs>North American Phalanx</rs>, so called, in <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> from New</placeName> York; the <rs>Ontario Phalanx</rs>, in northern New York; there was <num value="1">one</num> in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, and there were several others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5189"/>But none of them was successful; they did not pay. So we at <placeName reg="Brook Farm">Brook Farm</placeName> made the change we had so long considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5190"/>We got an act of the legislature incorporating the <rs type="place">Brook Farm</rs> Phalanx, and our whole society was merged into this new establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>We began again with hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5192"/>We got some new capital and we took in new members and added some new branches of industry-shoemaking, carpentry, work in britannia metal, and so on. But after a year or <num value="2">two</num> we found that the business was not going profitably enough, and we went to work to erect a new building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>We were now a phalanx, as <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00531.03832" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,M.,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>'s association is called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>The habitation of a phalanx is a phalanstery, and we put into ours the last cent we had. Well, <num value="1">one</num> night the whole thing took fire and burned up. And there was <num value="1">one</num> unpleasant fact about it. I was at the head of the financial department, and I was away at the time in New York, and the <num value="1">one</num> thing that we were most ashamed of was that the insurance expired the day before the fire and hadn't been renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/>But the faith of the majority of the members was not shaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5196"/>The faith of <persName n="Ripley,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00531.03833" reg="nearbymention:Ripley,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName> especially, a philosopher of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order, was just as firm, and he was just as firmly convinced of the truth of the associative theory when he saw the building go up in smoke as he was before; he was just as certain then as when he laid the foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5197"/>But after the building was burned up we had no longer the means of taking new pupils or introducing new industries and creating new revenues for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5198"/>When we came to make up our accounts for the year we found we had taken in considerable money, and we had spent all but <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> of it. There were about <num value="70">seventy</num> people in the establishment, including the members, children, and students, and certainly <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> wouldn't carry us through the next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5199"/><pb id="p.532" n="532"/></p> 
<p>You may like to know something about the mode of life there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>In reorganizing the society and bringing it down to the new basis, the teaching of <persName n="Fourier,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00532.03834" reg="nearbymention:Fourier,M.,,,"><surname>Fourier</surname></persName>, which we adopted, was that all industries should be carried on in groups and series.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5201"/>For instance, there should be a series of gardeners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/><num value="1">One</num> group of them cultivated trees, another small fruits, another vegetables, and there were half a dozen of these different but connected groups.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>So it was all through the establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5204"/>There was a series that managed the domestic labor or housework.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5205"/>There was a group called the group of the dormitory that made the beds and took care of the bedrooms generally; <num value="1">one</num> called the consistory that had charge of the parlors and public rooms; and <num value="1">one</num> called the refectory, which included the cooks, the waiters, and the dishwashers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5206"/>They were organized and worked together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5207"/>I know that, because I was the headwaiter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5208"/>And it was great fun, I can tell you. There were <num value="70">seventy</num> people or more, and at dinner they all came in and we served them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5209"/>So every department of the establishment was carried on in that way. Each person chose what he wished to do, what groups he would work in, and none of the boys and girls tried to shirk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5210"/>There was more entertainment in doing the duty than in getting away from it. Every <num value="1">one</num> was not only ready for his work, but glad to do it, and this brings me to a peculiar feature of the system: the person who did the most disagreeable work was the <num value="1">one</num> to receive special honor and distinction, because he was a servant of the others and was rendering to his brothers a service not pleasant in itself, but which, in other circumstances, they would render to him. In this scheme of social democracy that was <num value="1">one</num> of the most suggestive features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5211"/>In the phalanx the young people, the middle-aged, and the old should all be ready to do a duty which may be inconvenient, as well as that which it is convenient for them to do. For instance, <persName n="Ripley,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00532.03835" reg="nearbymention:Ripley,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>, the head of the phalanx, was the chief of the cow-milking group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5212"/>I belonged to the same group.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>That was a universal quality and characteristic of the society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5214"/>Just as a sculptor who is carving an Apollo, an image of divine beauty, goes to his work with joy and passion, so among us every duty and every kind <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> of labor ought to be performed with the same enthusiasm, the same zeal, and the same sense of artistic pride.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>That is the theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5216"/>It is true it was not always fully realized, but we realized a great amount of instruction, a great amount of satisfaction; and when we finally separated after the burning up of our building, in which so much of our hopes had been centred, we went away, each to begin life in the world again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5217"/>I went to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to earn <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> a week on a morning newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>We all began anew very soon except <persName n="Ripley,Mister,,,," id="n0179.0031.00533.03836" reg="nearbymention:Ripley,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ripley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5219"/>He remained and settled up the affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5220"/>And when the business was closed up and all the accounts settled and paid, as they all were, we owed nobody a dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5221"/>But I am sorry to say that <placeName reg="George Ripley">George Ripley</placeName> no longer possessed the fine library that he had previous to our experiment; it was sold to pay off the creditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5222"/>We were all proud of the fact, though he never spoke of it. And in a general way our experience was duplicated by the other associations or phalanxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5223"/>Without our special misfortune they all came to a similar end. I don't know of <num value="1">one</num> of them that lasted till <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5224"/>That is the story of the socialist movement of that day, and it certainly went far beyond the dreams with which <persName n="Coleridge,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00533.03837" reg="mostcommon:Coleridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Coleridge</surname></persName> and <persName n="Southey,,,,," id="n0179.0031.00533.03838" reg="mostcommon:Southey,nomatch:0"><surname>Southey</surname></persName> and their friends are said to have entertained their youth a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5225"/>We may say that, as a reform of society, the movement accomplished nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5226"/>But what it did accomplish was a great deal of good for those who were concerned in it and no great loss for any of those who furnished money.
