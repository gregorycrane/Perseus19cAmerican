<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>In presenting the following narrative of suffering endured while a prisoner in the socalled <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, the principal object had in view by the author, is to place before those into whose hands this volume may come, a plain, straightforward, unvarnished account of <hi rend="italics">facts</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>In regard to the workings and results of that system of human bondage to which our country owes its present difficulties, there have been so many mistaken ideas, statements, and theories, that it has become the duty of every true and loyal man to expose the truth; or, speaking with more correctness, to strip from the hideous skeleton of Slavery all its gaily painted and deceptive cloaks and masks, and to exhibit it in all its ghastly repulsiveness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>It is my purpose in the succeeding pages to narrate simply how, after being captured at the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs>, or <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName>, I was, on the most frivolous charges, tried for my life before several prominent Rebel <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, among <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> whom were <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n0018.0001.00002.00002" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0018.0001.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>; how I was subsequently chained with negro chains and cast into military prisons and common jails; how, escaping from these, and in company with <persName n="Collins,Lieutenant,A.,P.,," id="n0018.0001.00002.00004" reg="default:Collins,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Collins</surname></persName>, I made my way to the swamps; how we lived in these malarious marshes for <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>; how we were hunted with bloodhounds; how we were assisted by the slaves in our flight, and lastly, how, being recaptured, we spent weary months in confinement, and were finally, released on exchange from our dreadful captivity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He is next to the youngest of a family of <num value="9">nine</num> children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The father emigrated to <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> when <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> was quite young, and settled in <placeName reg="Shelby, Texas, United States" key="tgn,2002073">Shelby county</placeName>, where he lived and labored as an industrious farmer for a long lifetime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Being in moderate circumstances, he was unable to educate his children as he wished, as their young hands were an indispensable help in the clearing and tilling of the land; but the lads wrought for themselves a training and discipline in the fields, and at the fireside, such as made honest-hearted heroes of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Though this tuition may not be the most fashionable, it is far from being the least useful or influential in a nation like ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The only external polish that will never grow coarse is <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> the out-shining of inward purity and kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The law of love is a sufficient code of politeness and etiquette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The rarest soul-furnishing, and the most radiant and reliable loyalty, are virtuous intelligence, an appreciation of the true and the beautiful in Nature, in mind and morals, the utterance of generous impulses, the self-respect that prefers its own calm approval to the world's admiration and flattery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Such a heroism is purely democratic, and sets the price of its integrity too high to offer itself as a prize for party bidding!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It stands like a granite pillar, strong, and straight, and upright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We may build on this, and stand secure for solid years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is this untrammeled life the nation needs at this very time in the hearts of all her citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Geer,Mister,,,," id="n0018.0002.00012.00009" reg="nearbymention:Geer,John,James,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Geer</surname></persName> never received any lessons in the school of pretences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He never learned the art of deceiving or being deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He studied something deeper of the world while his hands held the plough that furrowed its surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He gained more instruction from the leaves on the forest trees than from the leaves of printed books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He cultivated at <num value="1">one</num> and the same time his own <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> mind, and the soil of his father's farm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>His surroundings were the pictures and poetries of Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>His eye saw no shams, his ear heard no complaints, his heart knew no hypocrisies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Trained in such a school, he became a thinker and a worker; his associations were altogether with plain and practical people; he was never flushed with feverish fancies, nor discouraged at any disappointments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Always cheerful, as only a busy doer and darer can be, he grew into manhood, full-built, tough-muscled, keen-nerved, and strong-minded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He acquired by hygienic habits a <quote>constitution</quote> that needed never an <quote>amendment.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He shaped, all unconsciously to himself, a moral character as honorable as it was humble; yet it was such as recognized in the minutest particular, and exacted to the fullest degree, the claims of a common brotherhood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Pure democracy, like all living, blossoming, fruit-bearing growths, flourishes best in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A principle that strikes root in an hour in the hotbed of the city, is apt to wilt and die in the sunshine of the open world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Aristocracy may be plaited into politics; but it takes integrity <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> and fellow-hood for web and woof of republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Young <persName n="Geer,,,,," id="n0018.0002.00014.00010" reg="nearbymention:Geer,John,James,,"><surname>Geer</surname></persName> was a democrat, in the honest signification of the term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Though poor and sunburnt, hard-fisted and plain-worded, he learned to feel that no man in the republic was his superior in rights &mdash; that no man in the republic was his inferior in privileges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The truth of Holy Writ, that declares <quote>all nations to be of <num value="1">one</num> blood,</quote> was his confession of faith in conscience and Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The spirit of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, that <quote>all men are created free and equal,</quote> was his political platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>These high authorities gave him early and earnest boldness as a friend of human liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At the age of <num value="18">eighteen</num>, he was called to the work of the <name>Gospel</name> ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He passed into this work, not as a mere profession, by the paths marked out by ecclesiastics,--not by college carpets and seminary shades,--but as the early preachers were called, so was he, from his daily avocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>His inherent firmness made him an unyielding, if not an aggressive <name>Christian</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He stemmed a strong current of opposition from the beginning of his ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>His independent <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> manner gave offence to rowdy transgressors, and frequently was he threatened and waylaid by the very doers of the deeds he made it a business to denounce in his sermons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But he wavered not from his sense of duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><num value="1">One</num> of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and truest friends was <persName n="Dalby,Reverend,R.,M.,," id="n0018.0002.00015.00011" reg="default:Dalby,R.,M.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Dalby</surname></persName>, a well-known minister and Temperance reformer in <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706"><rs type="direction">South-western</rs> Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>These <num value="2">two</num> men were acknowledged leaders in the war of annihilation against <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Alcohol</foreName></persName> and his conscripted hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>For years they were joined in word and work in the good cause of Temperance, and were separated only when, in the spring of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Geer,,,,," id="n0018.0002.00015.00012" reg="nearbymention:Geer,John,James,,"><surname>Geer</surname></persName> heard his wounded country's cry for help, and quickly stepped to a place in the front rank of her brave defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>His well-tried associate in battling against wrong, <persName n="Dalby,Mister,,,," id="n0018.0002.00015.00013" reg="nearbymention:Dalby,R.,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dalby</surname></persName>, was left behind now, only because he was physically unable to march to the rescue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Before entering the army of the <rs>Union</rs>, <persName n="Geer,Mister,,,," id="n0018.0002.00015.00014" reg="nearbymention:Geer,John,James,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Geer</surname></persName> had spent some <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> in the ministry, in and around the city of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>During that time he received about <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> members into the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>He was eminently successful as a revivalist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>When <placeName key="tgn,2335552" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Sumpter, Baker, Oregon">Fort Sumpter</placeName> was fired upon, he was stationed as pastor of the <rs type="place">George Street</rs> <orgName n="Methodist Protestant Church" type="church">Methodist Protestant Church</orgName>, in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>When the news of the outrage was received at the <rs type="place">Queen City</rs>, the pastor of <placeName reg="George Street Church">George Street Church</placeName> vowed he was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> soldier until either himself or the rebellion should be crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He began recruiting at once for the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of Freedom, and was as successful as he had been in marshaling forces for the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> of Peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Until this time he had been unwilling to interfere with the <quote>peculiar institution</quote> of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>But the moment the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> were insulted by the proud power, that moment a new resolve was made, to hate and to hurt the accursed thing henceforward, until the last vestige of it should be obliterated from American soil! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><persName n="Geer,Captain,,,," id="n0018.0002.00016.00015" reg="nearbymention:Geer,John,James,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Geer</surname></persName> is an earnest man. He engaged in the war, not for position or popularity, but as a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Although he started into the service as <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs>, he was willing to resign that <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> responsible office to the charge of another; and at once accepted a position that promised more excitement and adventure in days of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>He was appointed <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Adjutant General">Assistant-Adjutant General</rs> on the <rs>Staff</rs> of <persName n="Buckland,General,,,," id="n0018.0002.00017.00016" reg="nearbymention:Buckland,Ralph,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckland</surname></persName>, which commission he held when he was wounded and captured at <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>In these days of adventure and sacrifice, when the noblest men in the nation are made to suffer for country's sake, it is shameful to see how certain northern people and papers, professing to be loyal, are in sympathy with the arch treason of the <name>Secessionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>However well-attested may be the statements of surviving sufferers,--and no matter how fair the reputation of the man who dares to denounce the <name>Slaveholders</name>' Rebellion,--there are lurking copperheads with viper tongues to hiss their venomous abuses on all the brave soldiers who have bled under the <rs>Federal</rs> banner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>From the liberty to talk treason, slander the <name>Administration</name>, and abuse the soldiers-O <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, deliver us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The nation cries for liberty &mdash; not license-a liberty that is always loyal to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and this <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> Government &mdash; a liberty to love and bless the poor, the outcast, the suffering, and the oppressed! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>As our fleet made its way up the river, it was a sight at once grand and beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It was composed of <num value="100">one hundred</num> large steamers, laden to the guards with soldiers, cattle, and munitions of war. The river was at high water mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Through its surging waters our noble vessels ploughed their way, sending forth vast volumes of smoke, which shadowed and sooted the atmosphere from hill to hill across <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> the river valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Over our heads waved proudly the old banner-emblem of the free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>All hearts seemed anxious to meet the foe who had sought to strike down that flag, and the hopes and liberties of which it is representative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>A cry was heard on board that the enemy was near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>A moment more, and he opened fire upon us, to which we very promptly replied, and with good effect, for he soon dispersed, while none of our men received injury. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Continuing our way onward we stopped at <placeName reg="Hamburg, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099435">Hamburg</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-03-11"><day reg="11">11th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>; but, owing to the great freshet, were unable to disembark, and the next day were obliged to fall back to <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg</placeName>, where we effected a landing on the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="2">13th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>In the mean time, I was appointed on the staff of <persName n="Buckland,Colonel,Ralph,D.,," id="n0018.0003.00022.00028" reg="default:Buckland,Ralph,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Ralph</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Buckland</surname></persName>, then acting as <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier">Brigadier</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="4Brigade">Fourth Brigade</orgName>, under <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0018.0003.00022.00029" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, who commanded the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Most of us landed by the <num value="15" type="ordinal">15th</num>, and parties were sent out every day to reconnoitre, and many returned, reporting fights with the enemy, and the capture of prisoners, horses, and other valuables. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>On the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="2">28th</day></dateStruct>, we had quite a bloody conflict in a cotton-field, belonging to <persName n="Beach,Mister,,,," id="n0018.0003.00022.00030" reg="mostcommon:Beach,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Beach</surname></persName>, who was the owner of a small lot of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The rebels had robbed him of all his horses, pork, <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> and wheat, leaving him nothing but the cotton and a small amount of corn, which the <rs>Government</rs> intended to purchase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>But when we were dispatched for it, we found that the rebels, who were now in full retreat, had rolled the cotton against a corn-crib, and set both on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The next day we had a fight near the same spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Again, the next day, a reconnaissance showed the enemy to be in full force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/><num value="1">One</num> of these I found was already doing so, under the command of the <rs>Major</rs>, who was in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The company belonging to the <num value="70">Seventy</num>second regiment stood their ground, awaiting orders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>When I rode to the top of the hill, I could see the enemy about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards distant</measure>. The lieutenant of the <num value="72" type="ordinal">Seventy-second</num> was holding his men in readiness, and just as I reached them, they arose and opened fire, at which the rebels retreated to the right, evidently intending to flank us. But this was an unfortunate movement for them, as they had not proceeded far when they encountered <persName n="Crockett,Major,,,," id="n0018.0003.00023.00032" reg="mostcommon:Crockett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Crockett</surname></persName>, of the <num value="72" type="ordinal">Seventy-second</num>, with <num value="2">two</num> <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> <num value="100">hundred</num> men, by whom they were repulsed with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>By this time I had come up with the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/><persName n="Buckland,,,,," id="n0018.0003.00024.00033" reg="nearbymention:Buckland,Ralph,D.,,"><surname>Buckland</surname></persName> dispatched me immediately to order <persName n="Crockett,,,,," id="n0018.0003.00024.00034" reg="mostcommon:Crockett,nomatch:0"><surname>Crockett</surname></persName> to fall back, but to continue fighting while retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>As I proceeded on my way to Crockett-who, indeed, was a brave and daring officer &mdash; I met a lady of advanced age, in great distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>She was wringing her hands and crying: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Being alone, and in advance of the retreating companies, <orgName type="company" n="Company I">I</orgName> again encountered the old lady on the same spot where I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw her. Inquiring the cause of her grief, I learned that the rebels had been at her house, representing themselves as Union men, and that she had expressed herself to them, without disguise or reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>They had thereupon seized her son, tied him on a horse, and bore him away, intending to press him into their service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>My heart ached at the recital of this sad story, and at the thought of the suffering and agony to which so many families, between the <num value="2">two</num> great armies, would be subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>My sincere prayer to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, was that <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> he would sustain the right, and send confusion amidst the foes of freedom and humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The old lady seemed very apprehensive they would learn that she had divulged to me the facts alluded to. Thus it is by <hi rend="italics">fear</hi> that the loyal in heart are kept in submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Thus, the tyrant's power rules and dominates in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Wherever oppression and tyranny reign, they must have for their basis, violence and brute force-and these beget fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is as true that fear casts out love, as it is that <quote>love casts out fear.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/></p> 
<p>We returned to camp, and that night we felt confident that our pickets were in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The dreary hours passed slowly away, bringing at last the light of another morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Our pickets were then extended; and on returning from this duty, I remarked to <persName n="Buckland,,,,," id="n0018.0003.00025.00036" reg="nearbymention:Buckland,Ralph,D.,,"><surname>Buckland</surname></persName> that I believed we would be attacked before night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>But he thought not, and requested me to retire to my tent, and seek repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I went, but concluded to write to my wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> that afternoon, the rebels opened fire upon our pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I instantly mounted my horse &mdash; that I had left standing at the door, and rode with all speed to the picket line, where I discovered that the rebels had captured <persName n="Herbert,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0018.0003.00025.00037" reg="mostcommon:Herbert,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Herbert</surname></persName> and <num value="7">seven</num> privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The <num value="72" type="ordinal">Seventy second</num>, <num value="40">Forty</num>eighth, <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> and <num value="70" type="ordinal">Seventieth</num> were soon rallied; and I thought if no fight now ensued, it would be no fault of mine, eager as I was for the fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>So I rode rapidly up the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, in order to strike the <placeName reg="Hamburg, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099435">Hamburg</placeName> road, aware that I could see up that road about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>, and thus discover what was going on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>As I was proceeding, I perceived, at a little distance, <num value="2">two</num> rebels, who fled at my approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>I soon reached the road, and discovered, to my great surprise, that it was lined with rebels as far as I could see. I soon wheeled my horse, and, with accelerated speed, made my way back to <persName n="Buckland,General,,,," id="n0018.0003.00026.00038" reg="nearbymention:Buckland,Ralph,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>He again dispatched me to inform <persName n="Crockett,Major,,,," id="n0018.0003.00026.00039" reg="mostcommon:Crockett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Crockett</surname></persName> to retreat in order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>On my way thither, these words greeted my ear: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>Halt dar!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>halt dar!</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>I responded by firing my revolver, as a signal that I did not design to comply with the peremptory demand so euphoniously expressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The words proceeded from <num value="2">two</num> rebels, whom I discovered approaching me. They fired, and both loads took effect in my horse's shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>But he did not fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Applying my spurs, he sprang down a little declivity, where the rebels stood with their empty guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/><num value="1">One</num> of them struck at me with his empty weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I attempted <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> to parry the blow with my left hand, and received a severe wound, having my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> finger broken, which was thus rendered useless for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The instant discharge of my revolver resulted in breaking an arm of this foe, and I immediately turned to my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> antagonist, who was hastily reloading his gun. The contents of another barrel at once disabled him. This was all the work of a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Just at this juncture, it began to rain in torrents; and before I realized my situation, I discovered that I was surrounded by about <num value="50">fifty</num> rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The rain and the darkness in the woods, from the overhanging storm-cloud, rendered it difficult for the rebels to distinguish their own men from ours, and they made the mistake-fortunately for me, but the reverse for them-of firing at each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Their colonel, however, soon discovered the error, and gave the command to cease firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>There was now no possible chance for my escape, and I instantly received a blow which felled me to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>How long I remained insensible I could not tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I recollect taking cognizance of, was the act of <persName n="Gladden,Colonel,,,," id="n0018.0003.00027.00040" reg="mostcommon:Gladden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gladden</surname></persName>, who, dragging me out of a pool of water into which I had fallen, demanded my surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>I seemed to lose all thought of home, wife, friends, <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> earth, or heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The absorbing thought was the success of our army. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><quote>I have discharged my last bullet, sir,</quote> I replied. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>He commanded me to mount my horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>I refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>My captors then seized hold of me, and, throwing me across my wounded horse, made a rapid retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Our boys were coming at <quote>double quick,</quote> and so impetuous was their charge towards the enemy, who was now approaching-consisting of <orgName n="advance guard"><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n0018.0003.00028.00042" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s advance guard</orgName> of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> cavalry &mdash; that they began retreating in wild confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>More than a <num value="100">hundred</num> riderless horses ran dashing past me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>During this interim, myself and the guards detailed to take charge of me were located in a ravine, and hence the cannon shots passed over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>A rifle-ball from <num value="1">one</num> of our men, however, at this juncture, brought <num value="1">one</num> of the guards from his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>A rebel colonel approached him, saying, <quote>You are too good a man to die so.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>At this moment <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ball pierced the heart of the rebel colonel, and he dropped dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It was here that my horse fell and died, and I felt as if a friend had gone, whose place could not be easily filled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>There was a wild and gloomy grandeur in this battle-storm raging and booming over our heads like <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> thunders; and my heart was tremulous with hope at <num value="1">one</num> moment, and with apprehension at another, for the fate of our gallant braves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Alas! my soul mourned when I found they had been driven back by the overwhelming force of the enemy. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>They wondered why so many white men were confined and guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>I was much interested with <num value="2">two</num> negro waiters, who came daily to our room, <num value="1">one</num> about <num value="12">twelve</num>, and the other about <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of age.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/></p> 
<p>From this time I began to be more than ever interested in the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>I discovered a latent talent in the despised race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>I resolved to investigate this new field of inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The older <num value="1">one</num> of these waiters and myself, had afterward many a friendly interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>He told me that he had been reared in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>His father was a white man, who often comforted his innocent victim, by saying that her offspring should be sent North to freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>But when hostilities began, he entered the army, forgetful alike of his promises and his crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>This outraged woman was afterward hired to a planter, to work in a cotton-field, while her son was sent <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> to <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus</placeName>, as a hotel waiter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Such, thought I, are some of the barbarities of this horrid system of enslavement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>About this time a Colonel was appointed as commandant of this post, <persName n="Whitefield,vice-ex-Governor,,,," id="n0018.0006.00057.00098" reg="mostcommon:Whitefield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="vice-ex-Governor">vice ex-Governor</roleName> <surname>Whitefield</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>Our boarding and location were now changed, and we were placed in a back room and fed on scanty rations of corn-bread minus salt, and an indifferent supply of tainted meat, which emitted a very disagreeable effluvia. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>While in this condition, and lying on the bare floor, a citizen entered and informed us that his brother-in-law was then a prisoner in <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklyn, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus, Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>He said he had been taken at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, and that his wife had that day received a letter from him, and that he was walking the streets of <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus</placeName>, carrying his side-arms, and boarding at the <rs type="place">American House</rs>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>This statement aroused my indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>I never before felt so keenly my condition, and when he attributed the lenity of our government to cowardice and a disposition to admit the superiority of southern claims and dignity, and stigmatized us as <quote>invaders</quote> of their soil and suffering justly as such, I could not restrain the fiery wrath that burned within me. I have a faint recollection of seeing the man hurrying in <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> greedy haste from the prison, doubtless impelled by the fear of something to come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Again we were indebted to the kind services of our ever-faithful and unwavering friends of the race despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/><num value="1">One</num>, who flourished under the sobriquet of <quote><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>,</quote> rendered us efficient aid. Our object was to escape from the prison, and for this purpose <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> brought us a rope and chisel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>With the chisel, I cut a hole through the prison floor, but after laboring faithfully for some time, I discovered that the room below was filled to the ceiling with boxes and bales containing commissary stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>I had arranged with <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, who had brought me a desiderated map of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, to leave that night, he occupying a station on the outside, ready to aid me if necessary, and supplied with sufficient provisions for my contemplated flight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>When I found myself foiled in my effort to pass through the floor, I turned my attention to the hearth of the room, which I took up, intending to let myself down at that point, and make my escape through a window below, which was covered by a projecting roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>But just as I was about to take away the keystone of the hearth, I heard the guard cry out, <hi rend="italics">Corporal o&lsquo; de guard, post number fo&lsquo;</hi>, which arrested my attention, <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> and moving toward the window, discovered in the darkness of the night, that the rain was falling in torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Again my ear caught the voice of the guard, who, in his peculiar Southern intonations, was addressing the corporal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/><quote>I's gittin&lsquo; all wet; put me undah dat ar windah, dar.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/></p> 
<p>So the guard was stationed under the window where I had contemplated making my exit, and all my plans, for the nonce, were frustrated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Early the next morning <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> came to the door and said: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/> </p>

<p>

<p><quote>Why, massa, I don&lsquo; ought to have told you dat, but I don&lsquo; didn't know it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/></p> 
<p><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> came in, and I exhibited the hole in the floor, and assured him that if the fact of its existence were not concealed, I should be either sent to jail or hung.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>He looked at it, and fruitful as he was of expedients, soon devised a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tacked a piece of carpet over the hole, and afterward, finding that it would yield if trodden upon, constructed a rude seat immediately above it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>This, and other manifestations of intellectual and mechanical aptness, led me into a train of <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> reflection concerning a race so decried and degraded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>I asked with <persName n="Campbell,,,,," id="n0018.0006.00060.00099" reg="mostcommon:Campbell,nomatch:0"><surname>Campbell</surname></persName>- <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>From this time I became deeply interested in my <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> protege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>He seemed keenly alive to his condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/></p> 
<p>The hours wore heavily on in that dreary prison-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> brought our food in an old trough, which had doubtless been employed in feeding swine, and we were compelled to take in food in genuine primitive style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>In a short time, we received intelligence that we were to be removed to another apartment in the same building, and I began to feel a degree of uneasiness lest my effort to escape should be discovered by the hole in the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/><persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> again befriended me. He ascertained that a printingpress was to be put up in the room the prisoners had occupied, and while assisting in the work succeeded in placing a portion of the stationary materials in such a manner as to effectually secrete the aperture. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>As I have already intimated, our supply of food grew <quote>smaller by degrees and horribly less.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>Our gastronomic propensities were however, occasionally regaled by some delicacies (?) smuggled to us by <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> and his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Pete</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>We did not care then to inquire whether they obtained them honestly or not, but the probability <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> is that they were appropriated from their master's larder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/><num value="1">One</num> of our chief annoyances in this prison was in the person of a diminutive, pompous, and arrogant Irishman named <persName n="Mackey,,,,," id="n0018.0006.00062.00100" reg="mostcommon:Mackey,nomatch:0"><surname>Mackey</surname></persName>, who seemed to rejoice in the title of <quote>sergeant,</quote> which he took great care to frequently ventilate in the presence of the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>He was an orderly of the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs>, and the fellow, clothed with a little brief authority, seemed to be impressed with the sole idea that tyranny was the only attribute of <num value="1">one</num> so exalted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Once, when he came into my quarters, I asked him what object he could have in the rebel army, and what profit he expected to derive from the establishment of a confederacy? </p>

<p>So, selfishness, in the guise of slavery and pride, forms the substratum of the so-called <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>On further conversation with the sergeant, I learned that he had really no interest in the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, that he was not in the army from choice, but as a means of obtaining a livelihood, and that he bitterly cursed rebellion in his heart as the prolific parent of untold evils. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Our new room fronted the hotel, and from some of the officers we obtained permission to stand upon the balcony of the prison during a part of each evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion we were ordered back by the guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>I hesitated a moment; but in that moment a guard leveled his piece and drew the trigger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>Fortunately for me the gun missed fire, but at the same moment another guard fired, and killed a deaf man who had thrust his head from an upper window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>Realizing the danger to which I was exposed, I instantly withdrew. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>On the same evening, I noticed an unusual excitement among the rebel officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>To ascertain its cause I again had recourse to <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>. He requested me to tear a hole in my coat, and <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> then order him, in the presence of the guards, to take it to some tailor for repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>He insisted that I should speak angrily to him, for such a course would more effectually deceive the guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I did as he had directed, and he demurred, declaring that he wished dem <quote><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> would mend dar own close.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>The guards in a peremptory tone commanded him to get the coat, and have it repaired forthwith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>This was what <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName> desired; and with many protestations of hatred toward the whole <name>Yankee</name> race, he, with great apparent reluctance, carried the garment from the prison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>In a short time he returned, seemingly in the same mood, and with well-feigned indignation, handed over the coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>On examination I found a newspaper in <num value="1">one</num> of the pockets which contained an account of the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, the surrender of <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName>, and the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>, New Orleans, and other important information of which we had previously known nothing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>This little artifice and its successful management, while it furnished me with very cheering intelligence, also gave me an elevated opinion of <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s native talents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Other prisoners continued to arrive, many of whom had been wounded in the battle of <pb id="p.65" n="65"/> <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>, and new quarters were prepared for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>They were incarcerated in an old stone building not far from our prison, and although wounded and almost famished, were compelled to lie upon the hard floor, their wounds undressed, and their physical wants unattended to. I obtained permission to visit them, and as I entered the house my eyes were pained by a sight that beggars description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/><measure n="18" type="prisoners">Eighteen prisoners</measure>, <quote>crushed by pain and smart,</quote> occupied the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>There were men in that room who had been wounded for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, and who, during that whole time, had not received the slightest attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>The result had been that their wounds were tainted with putrid flesh, and alive with crawling maggots!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>I obtained a list of their names at the time, but, as the reader will hereafter learn, was subsequently compelled to burn it. The only apology the rebel authorities could offer for this brutal neglect was that they were too busily employed in attending to the wants of their own to look to the welfare of others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Many of the men died, some from their wounds, and others from disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The sad and sickening scenes of prison life daily harrowed up the soul's keener susceptibilities, and <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> by <num value="1">one</num> they yielded up their lives a sacrifice for liberty. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The old divine gave me an account of some of his sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>He had been frequently imprisoned for his loyal sentiments; and in a few instances made hairbreadth escapes from lynching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>While he was in prison he preached for us. The gospel sound was glorious to hear, even beneath the cloud that rested upon us. Though in bonds, we could listen to the voice of truth &mdash; the truth that makes us free indeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>I was here again amused and benefited by the ingeniousness of the colored people, of whom so many wiseacres are constantly seeking to prove a natural imbecility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Very often these shrewd observers would anticipate our wants, and bring us such articles as we really most <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>For this attempted escape, several were shot, and others were loaded with huge chains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>In the midst of this severe punishment they never once repined, but looked forward with ardent hope to a period when they might again be permitted to defend the ensign of liberty they so dearly cherished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The other ministers sought <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> to hold a meeting, and I went to the commandant to obtain his consent, which he granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>With a light heart, I returned to my brother ministers to report my success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>A moment after, a note was handed us, stating that no religious services, public or private, would be permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>After the lapse of a brief period, they concluded to send their own chaplain to preach to us. But we declined to hear him; and I was appointed to give our reasons therefor, which I did as pertinently as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>They then threatened to force us to become listeners to sentiments which were utterly incompatible with our views of patriotism and Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>But they parleyed, and finally desisted from their threats. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>He had in his possession a portion of the <rs>Old</rs> and New Testament, and with this volume it was our wont every day to repair to the shade of the pine-trees for meditation, reading, and prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The idea of escaping <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> from our horrible imprisonment, which was every day growing more and more severe, seemed to enter both our minds at about the same time, and we agreed to make it a subject of special prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>We shrank at the thought of abandoning our comrades in distress; but the hope of life, and the possibility of again striking a blow for justice and right, stimulated us while contemplating such a daring and dangerous project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>We looked upon the height of the picket-fence that environed us, the vigilant guard of <num value="400">four hundred</num> men that watched our every movement, and the battery of artillery planted within the enclosure, and our hearts oftentimes sank within us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>Once we relinquished our hope of personal deliverance, and determined to remain with our brethren, and, if necessary, die with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>He was occasionally visited by his wife, and so careful were the rebels, notwithstanding their boasted superiority, that <num value="2">two</num> guards with loaded guns were invariably detailed to dog the footsteps of this woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>A system of perfect espionage was constantly maintained, and so suspicious were the rebels of each other, that they would not permit a single guard, in any case, to accompany a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>An instance of the most barbarous torture it was ever my lot to behold, I witnessed while here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>It was inflicted upon a young man from <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 5" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName>, for some offence unknown to me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Acts like these filled our hearts with the most gloomy forebodings, and we began to seriously deliberate the propriety of consummating our previously contemplated escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>The distance seemed to be insurmountable, to say nothing of the impossibility of surviving the hot weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>But the hope of liberty gave zest to the project, and we determined at once and for ever to abandon the scene of so much horror and misery. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>In due time our <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> uniform was exchanged, and we were clad in rebel rags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Our hearts beat high with hope, and we were resolved to escape or perish in the attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>About <time value="8:30oclock">half past 8 o'clock</time>, we slowly <pb id="p.106" n="106"/> crawled out of the prison-Collins a little in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>This, with the exception of crossing the guard-lines, we apprehended would be the most dangerous part of our undertaking, and our movements were consequently slow and cautious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>We continued to advance, keeping within whispering distance of each other, until we reached a little clump of pines near the fence, which point we had previously selected as a rendezvous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>Here we paused to make further arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>We felt certain, now, that if we were discovered, we would be shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Life for us was only in pressing warily forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>After a minute's consultation, in the lowest whispers, it was agreed that I should take the advance, and that should I be discovered, and shot, he should return to his quarters; but if I succeeded in passing the guard-lines, and reaching our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rendezvous &mdash; a thicket of fallen bushes between the guard-lines and picketfence &mdash; I was then to announce my success by a single clap of the hands, which would be a signal for him to follow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>I accordingly lay down on my face, and crept quietly outward through the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>The intense darkness prevented my seeing a guard, who chanced to be stationed close to my path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>I <pb id="p.107" n="107"/> came within <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> of him, and could distinguish that he was reposing carelessly against a tree, playing with the rammer of his gun, the noise of which served to keep me from running against him. It was the most thrilling moment of my life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>But I soon got beyond the sound of the clicking ramrod of an enemy whose business it was to shoot just such adventurers as myself, and I began to breathe a little more freely as I neared our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rendezvous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>In a few minutes I was safe outside the lines, and snugly hidden beneath the dark foliage of the tangled bushes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>Just as I was about giving the signal to <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0018.0010.00107.00136" reg="nearbymention:Collins,A.,P.,,"><surname>Collins</surname></persName>, I discovered that I had frightened an artillery horse so much, that he broke loose from his hitching-rack, and in another moment it seemed as if all rebeldom were out in pursuit of him. Now I should be discovered!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>To run or lie still would be death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>An unseen Deliverer gave me presence of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>I resolved to turn rebel for the time being, and assist in catching the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>My life depended on the action of that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>I ordered all the rebels astir, assuming as best I could the arrogant Southern tone of authority, to assist me in securing the animal, and had the gratification of seeing him caught and led away, wondering whether that would be the last of the <pb id="p.108" n="108"/> <quote>catching</quote> to be done that night!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Again I started for our place of rendezvous; but being somewhat excited, and the darkness and rain of the night adding to my bewilderment, I ran against an artillery guard, who instantly exclaimed: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>My unseen Protector again aided me, and I once more assumed the rebel tone and manner.

<p>Soon after this, I succeeded in reaching our appointed place of meeting, but believing that the confusion of the guards in capturing the frightened horse had prevented <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0018.0010.00108.00137" reg="nearbymention:Collins,A.,P.,,"><surname>Collins</surname></persName> from attempting to follow, I went down to the fence alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/><measure n="5minutes" type="date">Five minutes</measure> later, I heard my comrade giving the signal at the outer rendezvous, to which I instantly responded, and in a very few minutes we were both outside the picket-fence, on the dismal banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 4" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee river</placeName>. <pb id="p.109" n="109"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>We traveled <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> before sunrise, and, just at daylight, crossed the river on a railroad bridge, leaving it between us and our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>It was a glorious summer morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>The birds, all beautiful and free, were chirping their matin praises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The fields and forests were fragrant with the blessed baptism of dews and glittered in rare brilliance before the rising sun. All nature was clad in robes of royalty, and voiced to sweet anthems of rejoicing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>But we were weary wanderers, homeless and hated, fallen among thieves and robbers in the midst of our native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>As the daylight grew stronger, we resolved to secrete ourselves in the thicket among the croaking frogs, and lie low in the dense undergrowth among the reptiles of the cane-brake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>We were destitute of provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>In our haversacks were the matches, salt, pepper and fish-hooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>We kindled a small fire, and burnt our papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>We did this regretfully, for we had some valuable notes and memoranda among them, but we chose to suffer their positive loss, rather than risk the danger of a recapture with them still in our possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>It was a sad sacrifice, in a solitary sanctuary, on a strange altar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Yet our safety demanded it, and it was done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>Our situation was now both desolate and <pb id="p.110" n="110"/> dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>We were in the midst of a vast cane-brake, the extent and surroundings of which were altogether unknown to us. The tall, straight cane-growths, like steady fingers, pointed upward to a land of liberty on high, and we knew a Present Guide thither, but we were without chart or compass in this lower wilderness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>About <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the afternoon, we ventured to the road, keeping a vigilant lookout in every direction, dreading the sight of white men, and ardently hoping to see the face of some lowly slave, in order to arrange with our ever-faithful friends and now brothers in common peril and oppression, for something to eat. For a long time we lay silent and watchful beneath the broad leaves of the swamp palm, close by the road-side; but instead of discovering a sympathizing negro to whom we might appeal for food and friendship, what was our bitter disappointment at discovering <num value="6">six</num> armed men on horseback, in pursuit of us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>They were making diligent search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>We could see them dismount and examine all probable lurking-places to the right and left of the road as they passed along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>As they came nearer, we heard their savage curses, and the threatened tortures that awaited us if re-captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>They <pb id="p.111" n="111"/> circled the thicket, and penetrated at every possible angle all about us; but we were so completely concealed that nothing but personal contact would reveal our hiding-place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time, our pursuers were within a few feet of us. They must have known we were in that brake, for they lingered within hearing until nightfall when they abandoned the search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>How thankfully beat our hearts as the sound of their horses' hoofs died away in the rearward distance! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>There was an advantage to us in what we at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> so dreaded &mdash; the proximity of these men. We were thereby enabled to overhear their plans of pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>They agreed to set watches at certain points on the road, the river, and railroad leading to <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>We were quite confident we had been betrayed by some cowardly prisoner, and suspected that fellow named <persName n="Clinton,,,,," id="n0018.0010.00111.00138" reg="nearbymention:Clinton,De,Witt,,"><surname>Clinton</surname></persName>, from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>We learned from our pursuers themselves, as they were searching for us, that this traitor of traitors gave the authorities of the prison all the information they desired, for he had played eaves-dropper more than once, rebel and prisoner as he was!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>With a thanksgiving and a prayer, we resolved to continue our journey immediately with the beginning of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>The night was calm and clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>All the sounds that broke the stillness were the hoarse croakings of the frogs, and the distant barking of watch-dogs on the plantations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Looking up to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for guidance, he gave us a glimpse of the <orgName n="North Star" type="newspaper">North Star</orgName>, the fugitive's light of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>We started in a south-east direction, through the cane-brake, traveling part of the time through dirty, stagnant water <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> deep, and sometimes almost to our arms; but it was a venture for life, and we urged our way patiently onward, until we came to water so deep that we were obliged to stop, and wait for the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>We hailed the daydawn with delight, hungry and weary as we were, for we had not tasted a mouthful of food since we left the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>As soon as the grayish light appeared, we discovered that we were on the bank of a swail, beyond which, on a little elevation of land, was <num value="1">one</num> of the richest blackberry fields I ever saw. It was like manna in the wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>With these delicious berries we <pb id="p.113" n="113"/> appeased our hunger, and were strengthened for new hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>The forenoon was <num value="1">one</num> of peculiar beauty to us. We found our Comforting Friend in that sacred retreat, present to cheer our souls and feed our bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>We rested a few hours, and talked of the goodness of the <rs>Lord</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, we ventured to leave the swamp, and strike out for the low hills, and travel through the pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>It was the <dateStruct value="-06-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, and a long day to us. We had scarcely entered the pine forest, when we saw <num value="8">eight</num> men with guns, on the lookout for us, some of whom we had previously seen on the same errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>We instantly retreated to the swamp, yet not before we were discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>The dogs were instantly put on our track, and in order to break the scent, we again sought the swail, and waded in water to our knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>We passed through the densest portions of the brake, where it stood thick and tall, forming, in places, an almost impenetrable wall of stalks, which we carefully adjusted behind us. After several hours of this cautious traveling and covering <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> our way, we were obliged to lie down among the swamp palm-leaves for rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>We could distinctly hear the baying of the bloodhounds in search of our track, but we felt pretty well assured they would not be able to follow it. The next morning found us wet and weary, and quite chilled by the dampness of our bed. We thought to make our way out to the pine hills, but had hardly concluded to hazard the attempt, when we again heard the hounds nearer than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>We then penetrated yet further into the tangled cane-thicket, for it had become a welcome retreat for us. By patient endurance we again baffled our enemies, only, however, to find ourselves threatened with starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>We tried to catch fish, but failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>We were even <quote>unlucky</quote> in our attempts to take frogs from the swail with our hooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>Our forlorn situation can better be imagined than described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Cold, wet, hungry, weak from exposure, heartsick with disappointments, and, worse than all, pursued as criminals by those who should have befriended us, we were almost ready to despair, and lie down to die in the midst of the dismal swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>I felt that indeed strange changes had occurred in my life; for, only a few months before; I was a free man, surrounded by the kindest of friends, happy in my cottage home, or in <pb id="p.116" n="116"/> my pastoral walks among the people whom I loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>But now I was compelled to flee for life, half clad and half starved, to the heart of a watery wilderness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>From our covert of shade we watched the sun go down, and felt the quiet night coming on. Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>dreary evening!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="986"/>sunless, hopeless, comfortless, and dark!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="987"/>thy memory haunts me still!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>But we lost not our confidence in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>We knelt in the black water, and prayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>And down through the still night-down through the deep darknessdown through the dense cane-brake-down to our prostrate souls afar in the solitude, came the <rs>Blessed Comforter</rs>, and we took courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>We thought of the old Jews, compelled to wander about in sheep-skins and goat-skins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>We trusted in <persName><foreName>Elijah</foreName></persName>'s and <persName><foreName>Elisha</foreName></persName>'s <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and remembered that <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n0018.0011.00116.00140" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName> had dwelt safely in the den of lions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>We were so completely thrown upon <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> mercy, that our faith was stronger than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>We felt that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was nearer in the shadows than in the sunshine &mdash; that in bowing in the water of the swamp to pray, we placed our lips nearer to the <rs>Infinite Ear</rs> than if we worshipped in temples on the mountain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>We spent the entire day, the <dateStruct value="-06-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, in this bog. When night came, we tried again <pb id="p.117" n="117"/> to sleep, but were annoyed by a new enemy-a legion strong &mdash; the pestiferous musquitoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>During the night, our attention was attracted by a sound like the driving of a stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>We arose and cautiously reconnoitered in the direction from which the noise proceeded, To our surprise, we came upon a small corn-field, containing about <measure n="2acres" type="area">two acres</measure>, surrounded by a rude fence of pine poles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>We trembled at the thought of being so near a human habitation; and after pulling a few stalks of the young corn to eat, we hastened into the thicket, and traveled on, The roots of the corn, cleansed and salted, were eaten with a relish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The sound which had arrested our attention proved to be that produced by an insect of the beetle species, and the painful stillness and solitude of the place, served to make it more impressive than it would otherwise have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>The <orgName n="North Star" type="newspaper">North Star</orgName> was our only guide; and shaping our course by its uncertain light, we again resumed our journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>We had not traveled far, however, until we became completely bewildered in the cane-brake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The sluggish water spread on every side, the thick cane and underbush so mingled and commingled, that it was impossible to move in any direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Again we concluded to tarry for the daylight; and breaking a few cane-stalks, and laying them <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> on the ground near a mossy log, for a bed, we tried to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>We were frequently disturbed in the night by prowling animals, but none of them was so terrible to think of as our human pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Judging it best to guard against all surprises from man or beast, we agreed to sleep and stand sentinel alternately until morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Thus we relieved and rested each other that memorable night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>It was a welcome day-dawn to us. For <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> I had stood guard over <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0018.0011.00118.00141" reg="nearbymention:Collins,A.,P.,,"><surname>Collins</surname></persName>, watching the stars mirrored on the smooth waters about our feet, and it was a glorious sunrise to us that chased the shadows and images away, and flooded our gloomy retreat with the light of morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Again we started onward, taking the sun for our guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The water grew gradually more and more shallow, and the brushwood thicker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Berries became scarcer, and our sufferings from hunger increased with every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>We were that day wandering weary, footsore, and heart-heavy, where in all probability, human foot had never trod before: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/></p><lg type="stanza"><l>In the dark fens of the dismal swamp, </l><l>The hunted <rs>Yankees</rs> lay; </l><l>We saw the fire of the midnight camp, </l><l>And heard at times the horses' tramp </l><l>And the bloodhounds' distant bay. <pb id="p.119" n="119"/> </l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>Where hardly a human foot would pass, </l><l>Or a human heart would dare, </l><l>On the quickening turf of the green morass, </l><l>We crouched in the thick and tangled grass, </l><l>Like wild beasts in their lair.</l></lg></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>On we pressed, amid the wild voices of the dark cane forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>Our progress was slow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>Byand-by, as we came upon a mossy log, we tarried and tried to rest our aching heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>We soon fell asleep, being overcome by fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>I dreamed of my loved ones at home &mdash; of watchful eyes and praying voices in our behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>I saw the old familiar hill-slope before my cottage door, the orchard, the fields, and, better than all, the friends of other days, and myself among them-all happy at the old homestead in free <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>Some hovering angel must have come and held the picture before my eyes, for I was in raptures of delight!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>Suddenly I was aroused from my slumbers by the tread of some animal, I knew not what.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>As I stirred, it hastened into the dark foliage and was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>I awakened my comrade and told him it was morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>He was surprised to think he had slept so long, and both of us were greatly refreshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>Again we prayed and pressed onward for home and friends, and for a sight of the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>We had decided on keeping <pb id="p.120" n="120"/> steadily on in a southeasterly course until we reached some point on the sea-coast then in our possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>The sun beamed hotly over our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>We traveled as fast as possible all day, hoping that we might find some negronone else in that region were human beingsand through the aid of slaves get something to eat, for we were actually starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>We captured a frog that day, and divided the precious morsel between us, with thanksgiving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>At night we lay down, but hunger and faintness prohibited repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>We longed for morning, We gazed upward to the twinkling stars, praying them to speed faster through the firmament, and let the sun arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>At length the blushing mom appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>I hailed it as the dawn of an eventful day, for now we must seek and obtain food, or perish in the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>The idea of falling into the hands of our enemies chilled our very souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>We thought to die alone, and <quote>let the dead bury the dead</quote> in the wilderness, rather than suffer ourselves to be recaptured and tortured to death by inches, to gratify the jeering, jabbering multitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>But the day was come when something more must be ventured for life's sake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>At last dawn came, and again we fell upon our knees and asked for wisdom and direction in the hour of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/><pb id="p.121" n="121"/> Rising comforted and strengthened, we changed our course, and pressed forward, expecting to emerge from the cane-brake and find a plantation where there were slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>The undergrowth was so dense that we could with difficulty make about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> per hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>The day was fast passing away, and so was our strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>At about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the afternoon, we sat down, almost in despair, and held a council, when we decided that nothing but the hand of the <rs>Lord</rs> could deliver us. Again we bowed ourselves before Him, and rose refreshed both in mind and body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>Our steps were elastic-our hearts gladdened, and we hurried onward, under the conscious protection of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>Suddenly, I heard the barking of a dog not far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>We paused and listened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>It was not a bloodhound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Now we knew that help was near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>We quickened our pace, and in a few minutes heard the voices of some negro men. A few steps further, and we came in sight of a cotton-field, which we approached by walking in the water of a small brook that flowed in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>With great caution, we neared the field, in which there <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> were <num value="25">twenty-five</num> negroes at work ploughing cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>Most of the men looked old and toil-worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>While we were reconnoitering our ground, I observed an old, gray-haired man nearing the fence with his furrow, and when he paused a moment to scrape his plough, before returning across the field, I rapped on a rail, which instantly drew his attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>When I caught his eye, I beheld an intellect and a sympathy languaged there which gave me hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>I approached the old man with trembling step and faltering voice, I know, for there was danger of communicating with some excitable and treacherous slave-although such are rare cases-yet I ventured to speak to my wondering auditor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>I approached that cotton-field, half famished as I was, with many of my <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> prejudices against the negroes, for I had been taught to regard them as unreliable and stupid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>But I felt that death was in the swamp, and life might be in the cotton-field. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>It was weird, eccentric music, but really the most thrilling I had ever heard, as it rose through the still evening air in rich, mellow accord from the voices of the whole company of slaves returning to their humble homes for supper and rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>I thought, how little the people in the <rs>North</rs> knew about these <hi rend="italics">crosses</hi>! and I silently but fervently prayed for the day to hasten when all these weary ones might find the liberty for which they sang and suffered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/></p> 
<p>I confess that the thought of being pursued by bloodhounds was horrifying in the extreme; and notwithstanding we had already seen <num value="2">two</num> large packs at different times upon our track, the possible death by these fierce monsters in this wilderness made my blood run cold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>Our further conversation gave us a full and satisfactory knowledge of our route, and was delineated by our sable friend, as we had afterward reason to know, with perfect geographical accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>We asked him that in case we should be pursued by the bloodhounds, what means we should employ to bewilder them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>This was no new subject to him. He, in c6mmon with his fellow-bondmen, had seen too many instances in which these brutes had been employed in capturing fugitives, not to know <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> their nature, as well as the plans adopted to elude them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>He told us when the dogs followed us in the cane-brake, in order to prevent them from keeping the trail, we should travel as much as possible in the water; but if we should be closely pursued, to leave the canebrake, and take to the <placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 4" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>He assured us that the dogs were fearful of the alligators with which that river abounded, and that the slaves were taught that alligators would destroy only negroes and dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>He didn't believe it himself, although his master thought he did. He added: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>This piece of information, and the manner in which it was conveyed, accompanied as it was by violent gyrations of the body, and an exact imitation of dog-sneezing, was very amusing; <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> and though surrounded by forbidding circumstances, we indulged in an audible smile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>From this man we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> learned of a complete organization among the negroes, for the purpose of aiding fugitives in making their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>It was similar to an institution which I had often heard of as existing in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, under the name of <quote><orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">Underground Railroad</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1129"/>The officers of this Southern <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">Underground Railroad</orgName>, on which we were glad to take passage, were the slaves of the different plantations, who were thoroughly acquainted with their duties, and were very suspicious lest they should be imposed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1130"/>When we inquired how these men should know us, he told us that he would arrange that matter, so that we need have no fears, but to submit ourselves to their guidance, and all would be well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>We traveled that night through the plantation belonging to the master of this black man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>All was lone and silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>The wood through which we went, with its alluring depths &mdash; the verdant moss beneath our eager feet-each blossomladen, fragrant bough-and the bearded grasses <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> that shook in the wind,--all gave me their secret sigh.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>While thus making our way through the forest, we fancied we heard the sound of pursuers, and were once more obliged to take refuge in the dismal, but now welcome cane-brake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>Just where we entered the swamp, the water was very shallow, and, consequently, afforded us but poor protection from the bloodhounds, whose peculiar cries we expected to hear every moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>We therefore made our way with as much haste as possible far into our miry retreat, where the depth of mud and water secured us from the scenting of the fearful animals and their bloodthirsty masters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>Presently we came upon a stream of water, which, diverging from the river at a point above, made a circuit, and fell into the river again at a point below us, thus converting the area it embraced into an island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>The water looked deep, <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> and we did not relish a soaking, after having our clothes dried during our stay in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>But once on the island, our safety was insured for there was no ferry-boat, nor even a skiff, in that silent, murky swamp, by which our wouldbe captors might cross over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>Besides, we had seen too many hardships to be frightened by trifles, and we therefore plunged boldly in, my brave comrade taking the advance, and soon reached the island. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>That <time>night</time>, <dateStruct value="-06-24"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct>, we made ourselves a bed on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 4" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee</placeName>, by cutting down the canes which grew around us in luxuriance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>We also kindled a fire, after screening the spot so effectually as to prevent its light reaching the eyes of any foe; and by its cheering flames we partially dried our wet and ragged clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1146"/>Casting ourselves upon our rude couch, we watched the beautiful stars in the distant realm on high, and listened to the murmurs of the crystal stream that was protecting us from pursuit, until at last we fell into a deep slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>Just before closing our eyes, we heard, at some little distance below us, a noise resembling that which might be made by a huge log, <num value="1">one</num> end of which was caught upon a sand-bank, and the other playing loosely in the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>But we were too sleepy to suppose that there <pb id="p.133" n="133"/> was any danger indicated by the odd sound, and we paid no attention to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>Protected by that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who watched <persName n="Hagar,,,,," id="n0018.0012.00133.00143" reg="mostcommon:Hagar,nomatch:0"><surname>Hagar</surname></persName> in the wilderness, we slept peacefully until daydawn, when we were suddenly aroused by the most terrific noise I had ever heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1150"/>It resembled the sound of a heavy steam-whistle, though not quite so loud nor shrill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>Remembering at the moment a description by <persName n="Boucher,Reverend,Joshua,,," id="n0018.0012.00133.00144" reg="default:Boucher,Joshua,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Joshua</foreName> <surname>Boucher</surname></persName>, who had traveled in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, of the bellowing of an alligator, I at once concluded that this must be <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>Stepping from my tent, or rather cane-hut, I had ocular demonstration of the fact, for there, only a short distance from me, lay the hideous reptile in all his ugliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>Thinking it about time that <num value="1">one</num> or the other of us should change quarters, I threw a chunk at him. He took the hint, and crawled away into the water, only, however, to return in about <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> to his old post, where, opening his fearful jaws, and keeping them so until they were covered with flies, he snapped them together with a report that chilled our blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>This was <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, <dateStruct value="-06-25"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="25">25</day></dateStruct>, and we intended to remain all day in the swamp, for the river was lined with boys and negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>During the afternoon, we espied a skiff the opposite side, and laid several plans to obtain possession <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> of it, but they were all frustrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>This proved to be a blessing, however, for, while making our last attempt, we were seen by an old negro, who seemed to recognize us immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>From this lowly slave we learned that the river was guarded for miles, to prevent our escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>Our pursuers were on the watch for us all the way to Hockinsville.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>This newly-found friend pointed out to us our only path of escape, and appointed a spot where he would meet us at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, and bring us some food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1160"/>We blessed the negro, and, following his directions, reached the place of refuge, where we anxiously awaited his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1161"/>But the hour passed on, and so did several more, but he came not. He had, doubtless, been seized by the patrollers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1162"/>The sun of the <num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num> found us still pressing forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1163"/>We had gotten thus far, like the old apostles, with <quote>neither scrip nor staves,</quote> but we felt that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was with us, and his servants, the poor, downtrodden slaves, helped us on. Whenever we met <num value="1">one</num> of the latter, who replied to our question, <quote>Can't dis yer day,</quote> he was a friend, but unable to assist us on account of the patrollers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1164"/>If <num value="1">one</num> answered, <quote>I know you,</quote> he was posted, and all was well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>We passed the night in the pine woods, I remaining awake, and guarding my friend, <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n0018.0012.00134.00145" reg="nearbymention:Collins,A.,P.,,"><surname>Collins</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.135" n="135"/> who was completely worn out. During the next day, we made a good distance, in spite of numerous difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1166"/>By the <num value="28" type="ordinal">28th</num>, our rebel clothing was well nigh worn off us, and our hunger began to increase terribly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1167"/>In the evening, we came upon some slaves in a field, among whom were several females, about <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of age. The latter were almost naked, having nothing on them save a very short skirt, fastened round the waist, and held in its place by straps, which passed over the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1168"/>All the upper portion of the body, and about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the nether limbs, were thereby exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1169"/>None of their complexions were black, while <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of them were nearly white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>We agreed with these slaves to hide ourselves in a neighboring lane until night, when they promised to bring us food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>Shortly after, <num value="1">one</num> of them brought us the unwelcome intelligence that we were in danger, and warned us to again take to the swamp, which was some half a mile away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>This we did, and after wandering some time along the edge thereof, sat down at last beside a clear crystal spring, in which were sporting numbers of beautiful fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>We could hear the negroes singing in the field &mdash; which exercise was a signal we understood to mean that we <pb id="p.136" n="136"/> should lie still until it ceased, when we might safely venture out to the lane-until about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, when all became quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>By midnight we returned to our designated hidingplace, where we were soon joined by a black man and <num value="1">one</num> of the girls, a beautiful, modest creature we had seen in the corn-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>They brought us fat meat, corn-bread, greens, and <quote>bonny-clabber,</quote> which was a welcome sight to us. During the conversation we held with these negroes, we learned that their master had gone to the war, leaving them in the charge of an overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>We ascertained, also, that <quote>the <rs>Yankees</rs></quote> had possession of <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName>, on the coast, and that, in consequence, the slaves had been removed into the interior of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>Close by there were <num value="300">three hundred</num> rice-farm hands encamped, who were in a starving condition, having been driven to the interior of the <rs>State</rs> by their masters, in order to prevent confiscation, and being unable to make a living for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>Our humble friends informed us that if we continued straight on we would reach <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName> in <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, provided we exercised due caution to avoid the patrollers, who, since our escape from <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName>, had been searching for us vigilantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>The night was well nigh all spent in conversation with these slaves, and <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> we had not got much further on our way, when the dawn broke upon us, compelling us to leave the road and take to the pines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>We were subsequently obliged to leave even these, and plunge once more into the more friendly swamps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>After our slender stock of provisions was exhausted, we became exceedingly hungry, and the day passed away without our obtaining even so much as a frog or fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>We slumbered all the night, which was chilly and damp, in the cane-brake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>A fire which we had kindled, we were obliged to extinguish, for fear that its light might point out our refuge to some enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>During the stilly hours that followed, we were once disturbed by a strange noise, which, I subsequently ascertained, in a conversation with <persName n="Kost,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n0018.0012.00137.00146" reg="mostcommon:Kost,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev. Dr.</roleName> <surname>Kost</surname></persName>, must have been made by a panther. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>The next day, being terribly fatigued and hungry, we resolved to make an attempt at replenishing our <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">commissary department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>The sun came up bright and very hot, and our journey through the swamp-palms was indeed a toilsome <num value="1">one</num>; but these self-same palms secured us against our pursuers, and we therefore did not complain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>An effort that we made shortly after to leave <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> the marsh, discovered to us our pursuers, and we were once more forced back to our muddy asylum, where we concealed ourselves beneath a muscadine vine until <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>. While so concealed, a strange noise fell upon our ears, and presently we saw a black man coming directly toward us, blowing a horn to call swine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>When he was about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> from us, we called to him, with the expectation of learning from him at what points on the river the guards were stationed, and also of obtaining from him something to eat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>Upon being <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hailed, he exclaimed, <quote>Don't know you, sah!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>and when, stepping from my concealment, I called to him a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, he seemed terrified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1191"/>The next instant he fled madly away from us, we pursuing him desperately, in order to secure him, and thus save ourselves from new pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1192"/>But, notwithstanding the fact that he carried a bushel basket half filled with corn upon his back, he distanced us. Once he stumbled in a swail, and sent the corn and mud all over himself, but he quickly regained his feet, and was soon after lost to our view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>We were now indeed in peril; and very shortly afterward, the wild bay of the bloodhounds rang upon our ears through the murky <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> air of the morass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>Nearer, clearer, deadlier came the dreadful sounds, and we crouched in our retreat, expecting every moment to see the ferocious animals bounding upon us. But, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for his watchful mercy, the brutes, misguided by a stratagem which the negroes had taught us how to execute, were deceived, and we had the infinite delight of seeing them dash into the stream, swim to the other side, and then, renewing their fierce cries, bound away, closely followed by <num value="15">fifteen</num> human bloodhounds mounted on fleet horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>The peril was not past yet, however, for, finding themselves thrown from the scent, the well-trained brutes soon came back to the stream, recrossed to the side we were on, and coming to our old track, lay down, snuffing and panting, not a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from us. Think of that, reader!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>Peeping through the canes we beheld the glistening eyes of the hounds, saw their long tongues lolling from between their powerful jaws, and saw their large, terrible teeth shining like pearls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>Their savage masters stood on the bank of the swail cursing us, and threatening what they would do if they retook us. Once more the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of our fathers stretched forth His arm and delivered us, for, hearing them post their men, <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> we struck away from them in a northern direction, and shortly had the satisfaction of leaving them some <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>Onward, onward we pushed, until so overcome with fatigue that we were fain to stretch ourselves upon the sand and sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>This was <dateStruct value="-07-3"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="3">3d</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>The succeeding day &mdash; the <name>Fourthbroke</name> upon us bright and beautifully, and we sped forward with all the power of our limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>We came at last to a very scanty corn-field, which, as we learned from the slaves who attended to it, yielded only about <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> bushels to the acre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>Cotton was the staple in that region, and with it were bought all the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Poor as was the corn, however, we carefully confiscated some roastingears, on which, with half of a frog, we made our <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>-of-<dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> dinner, thanking our Divine preserver for the gift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>The remaining half of the frog was carefully reserved, with some corn, for a future meal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>The morrow was cloudy and cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>We were now drawing near to the coast, for, as we went along, we espied a turtle belonging to a species that lived only in salt water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>His shell was extremely beautiful, and would, doubtless, have been very valuable had we thought about dollars and cents; but some berries, which we <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> found, were of far greater worth to us at that time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>Night found us still wandering in the land of rattlesnakes, scorpions, and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>Next day, while hunting a sweet-potato patch for a stray root or <num value="2">two</num>, we saw a negro man, to whom we did not, however, get a chance to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>Fearing that he might not, perhaps, be friendly, we once more betook ourselves to the pines, where, although we did not know it at the time, we were hotly pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Soon afterwards, the rain fell in torrents, while the thunder rolled in heavy peals, and the lightning played sharply about us. When evening came, we were soaking wet, and chilled through; and coming to an old dilapidated building, that was overgrown with <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> moss, and seemed as though it had been uninhabited for many a year, we hurried into it. By the aid of the lightning, we found that it was nearly filled with half-wild goats, which, on our arrival, hastily evacuated the premises, leaving us in free and undisputed possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>The structure was nothing more than an <orgName n="Old Church" type="church">old church</orgName>, with some rude benches in <num value="1">one</num> end, and a ruined chancel at the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>I here found some leaves of a Bible, upon which I pillowed my head for the night, and slept the more sweetly that I did so. Adjoining this <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> church was a graveyard, containing some rough tombstones, beneath which slept the dead ones of many years, all unconscious of the events passing above their heads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>The following day we left our retreat, and continued our flight in the midst of a terrible storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>About <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time>, we discovered a sweet-potato patch, but it had been completely stripped of every root.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>That night, unable, on account of having got our matches wet, to kindle a fire, we slept in a corn-field, pulling the dried stalks over us to partially shelter us from the descending rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>The next day, we resumed our flight, or rather our wading, for every rivulet was swollen to a good-sized creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>In endeavoring to cross a turbid stream upon the <quote>giddy footing</quote> of a loose log, we were precipitated into <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> of water, and were obliged to swim to the other shore, grateful that we escaped with nothing worse than a ducking. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/><measure n="2miles" type="distance">Two miles</measure> further on, we suddenly came upon some houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>Men and women were passing almost within hailing distance; but caution forbade us revealing ourselves, and so we attempted to regain the swampy thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>On our way thither, we passed a field in which were a number of geese; and so strong was the temptation to ascertain whether goose was as palatable as frog, that we halted, and concealing ourselves, wearily awaited the fall of night, intending to make a foray by starlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>But by <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> a heavy thunderstorm came up; and dreading to be again wet, we made our way to an old waste-house near by where, shortly, much to our surprise, in came <pb id="p.144" n="144"/> <num value="2">two</num> men, <num value="1">one</num> rather old, and the other young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>This they thought was all true; and when the rain ceased, we kept up the deception by walking along the road with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>They soon after struck off into a by-road, and when we had gone a little further on, and thought ourselves safe, we turned our footsteps back towards <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>Just as we turned, we were hailed by a man all clothed in rags, whose appearance indicated that he might have been hiding in the swamp for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1253"/>He then invited us to his house to get something to eat, to which, of course, we had to consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1255"/>They immediately seized the master of the house, and put him under a heavy guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1256"/>Here was a new dilemma, and I winked at my comrade to answer all questions, as I was fearful that if both of us undertook the task; some fatal mistake might occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1257"/>He did so, and succeeded remarkably well, for he was shrewd and quick at perception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>I stood carelessly by the fire, drying the only stocking I had, and playing the idiot to what I thought perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>The intruders were dressed savagely, their heads being covered with rudely-made caps of coon-skin, the tail of the animal hanging down their backs.

<p>The conscripting officer, however, was not so easily turned aside, for failing to induce the <quote>squire to hold a trial on us,</quote> he sent a message to the deputy sheriff, and that high functionary came promptly to the rescue of the <quote>Confederacy,</quote> and arrested us.

<p>In the morning, our merciless captors, forming on either side of us, and also in our rear, forced us to march forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>My wounded foot and hand pained me very much, and it was with the utmost difficulty that I could walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>The disparity, also, in the height of my comrade and myself &mdash; I being much taller than he-caused me to give him a severe jerk at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>So fatigued and dispirited did we at last become, that we threw ourselves down, and refused to go any further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>At this our captors threatened to shoot us. We were not to be intimidated thus, however, and the ruffians were at last obliged to obtain a rickety old wagon, in which we were carried some distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>The jury was composed almost entirely of old men, and while they were preparing for their assumed duties, our guards were off trying to hunt up some whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>But as the latter article was worth <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">eight dollars</measure> a pint, their efforts were not likely to meet with <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> much success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>In the course of their pursuit they had stopped at the <rs>Captain</rs>'s door, and inquired of him if <num value="2">two</num> men, answering our descriptions, had passed that way lately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>Thinking at the moment of the <orgName n="Old Church" type="church">old church</orgName>, and wishing to test their bravery, he informed them that he believed they would find us there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>We also saw his negroes' quarters, and they were nearly as good as his own house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>As we passed along on our way to inspect a field of sugar-cane, we were amused to see the slaves peeping at us from behind the comers of their cabins. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>Our friend next furnished us with water, soap, towels, and a razor, and going into the sugar-house, we cleaned ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>I must have spoken rather loudly, for the next morning, this identical slave woman, while dressing my wounded foot, asked me to what church I belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>On my telling her, she sprang away quickly, and ran and informed her mistress that I was a minister of their church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>The lady immediately came to me, her face wreathed in sweet smiles, and inquired if such was really the case.

<p>At this moment breakfast was announced, and after the conclusion of the meal, I was requested by both the sheriff and his wife, to lead in <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>The <rs>Lord</rs> put words into my mouth, and we had, indeed, a happy time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>My host then invited me to take a walk with him, which I did, though my foot gave me considerable pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>We fell immediately to conversation, in the course of which I got a full insight into the real condition of affairs in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p>

<p><quote>There, sir, you are much mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>We shall suffer heavily; for, though we have farms and plantations, yet we have not hands to work them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1383"/>And another thing, perhaps, you are not aware of, is, that we have <num value="1000">thousands</num> of poor men who live here and there, in their pole-huts, rearing large families on the little crops of cotton and so forth, which they raise on some other <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> man's farm, upon which they have squatted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1384"/>In the fall they hunt, and thus supply their families with meat and salt; the skins of the animals they take to procure the latter article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>So they live, half human, half animal, letting their progeny loose upon us. Of course, many of them must starve now. If they could obtain salt, however, they might live on gophers, which abound in the pine-forests.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/></p> 
<p>Presently, we came in sight of a wretched hut, about which I saw some white children playing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>My companion led me thither, with the remark: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>Upon reaching the hut, my blood almost chilled at the sight of squalid poverty which I beheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>There stood a family of <num value="10">ten</num> persons; a father &mdash; who on account of his age had escaped the conscription &mdash; a mother, and <num value="8">eight</num> ragged, filthy children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/></p> 
<p>I got this miserable creature to make me a pair of slippers from old boots, for which I paid him <measure n="1.50dollars" type="currency">one dollar and fifty cents</measure>, in order that he might get some <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn-meal</rs>, which sold at <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">two dollars and fifty cents</measure> per bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>This money was part of a sum that the sheriff had kindly lent me. Before we took our departure, the lady (?) of the hut gave us her opinion, in no measured terms, of the rascally <rs>Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/><quote>Ah, sir,</quote> said the sheriff, when we were out of hearing, <quote>if I were to speak the real sentiments of my mind, I should be hung before <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. I am a Union man, and when you get back to <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, I want you to tell all the friends in our Church that I am so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>I am in reality an anti-slavery man, and these are my reasons therefor: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, it is a sin in the sight of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; secondly, it is an injury to the slave himself; and thirdly, it is an injury to the white race.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/></p> 
<p><quote>How so?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>asked I. </p>

<p><quote>How do the rich obtain their wealth?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>said I. </p> 
<p><quote>In this way. A man comes here, perhaps, with <num value="1">one</num> female slave, and, in a comparatively short time, he has quite a number of young servants about him. Some of these he sells, and with the proceeds purchases a piece of timber-land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>This he has cleared, sells the timber, gets more slaves and another piece of land, and so goes on adding to his wealth continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/><quote>But,</quote> added he, warmly, <quote>I do not care if it is, provided the <rs>Union</rs> is restored!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/></p> 
<p>The sentiments expressed by this man astonished me, and I could not forbear asking him the reason why he opposed slavery so earnestly, and yet held in bondage <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> human beings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/><quote>I never bought nor sold a slave in my life!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>These other slaves are all their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>I would have freed them long ago, but they refused to leave me; and I, on the other hand, could not leave them to go North, for I would have been obliged to give security that they would not become a pest and burden to the community, and that I was unable to do. So, you see how the case stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>But I am not alone in my sentiments, sir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>Oh! thought I, if our people at the <rs>North</rs> were permitted to look into the hearts of the better class in the <rs>South</rs>, there they would see nothing but opposition to the great sin of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>You may ask why we do not educate the poor whites, and thus set at work a force that would destroy the power of the aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>We would willingly do so, but for the fact that they are so stubborn, ignorant, and bigoted, that any attempt of such a nature would be termed <hi rend="italics">abolition</hi>, and you might, with far more safety, call a man a thief or murderer than call him an <hi rend="italics">abolitionist</hi>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>But to return to my theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>When, after passing through innumerable hardships and perils, being imprisoned in <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName>, and spending twentyone weary days in the dismal swamps and pinewoods of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, I reached the home of the sheriff, I, like <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0018.0015.00174.00171" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> the apostle, thanked <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and took courage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>And here a thought suggests itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>The reader has, doubtless, often thought, after reading the various and conflicting accounts of returned prisoners, how strange it was that they could so differ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>Now, their treatment depended entirely upon their own conduct, and the class of people among whom the chances of war threw them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>It was very rarely that any <num value="1">one</num> expressing his opinions against the <rs>Southern</rs> system as boldly as I did, met, upon the whole, with such good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>Those who fared well were semi-secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>I will give a case in point: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>At <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus, Mississippi</placeName>, there was a man from <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 5" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName>, who stated that he was a quartermaster in a cavalry regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>He was an ardent pro-slavery man, and whenever the subject came up, he defended the right of the <rs>South</rs> to hold slaves, and became enraged if that right was assailed by any of his companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>This man took the trip with us through <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName>, and was continually receiving favors that were denied to the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/>While in <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName>, he was appointed prison quarter-master; was permitted to run at <pb id="p.176" n="176"/> large, and he used the privilege to post the secessionists in everything that was favorable to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>This man will be referred to again ere I close this narrative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>We were to go by land to Hockinsville, where we were to take the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>We traveled slowly, in order, as the sheriff remarked, that we might really see the destitute condition of the country through which we passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>We stopped at a place where a deer had just been killed, and obtained some fresh venison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>The man from whom we got the meat, was from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Maryland</placeName>, and, while conversing with him, I found that he had some knowledge of the disunion men of the <orgName n="Methodist Episcopal Church" type="church">Methodist Episcopal Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>He was deeply opposed to the separation, but at the same time, candidly admitted that the <rs>North</rs> had sufficient cause therefor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/><quote>I and this gentleman,</quote> said he, turning to the sheriff, <quote>have stood up for our faith comparatively alone, until the outbreak of the war. Since that, we have been joined by several more, but we are crushed, and dare not speak what we think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/><pb id="p.177" n="177"/> </p> 
<p>He persistently contended that it was a very unfortunate thing that the <rs type="place">Church</rs> had divided, urging that it led to a division of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>I held not much further argument with him on this subject, as anti-slavery men of his class were very unpopular in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> when I left there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>At evening we seated ourselves on the porch of this man's cottage, and began conversing with the family, the subject being changed of course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>The majority of the residents in this county held the same opinions as these <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>I would like to give the names of these gentlemen, but as they might possibly get into some of those traitorous Northern papers which circulate in the <rs>South</rs>, and thereby bring them into trouble, I am constrained to suppress them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>We remained at this house all night, and bidding our new friends farewell, started the next morning on our way. We kept the <placeName reg="Darien, McIntosh, Georgia" key="tgn,2022633">Darien</placeName> road, which I could recognize by the descriptions given of it by the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>Our next stopping-place was far from agreeable, for every <num value="1">one</num> in it was a strong secessionist-so strong indeed, that, when they found out our characters, they utterly refused to give us anything to eat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>The sheriff, however, pacified him at last by telling him that I was from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and that, although I was in the <rs>Yankee</rs> army, still I was as pro-slavery a man as himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1544"/>This made matters a little better, and the surly host proceeded to question me. I baffled him, however, by saying: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>He then became much interested, and was not satisfied until I had given him a long description of a gunboat, its object, and its powers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>At this juncture <num value="5">five</num> villanous-looking men entered the room, and calling to my listener, took him outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>When the sheriff saw this, he turned rather pale, fearing that some violence was threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>When he was about to leave with us he asked the landlord what his bill was. <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1558"/>Though by no means complimentary, this expression took a heavy load off our minds, and we were comparatively light-hearted when we took our departure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1559"/>The sheriff resolved not to halt again until he reached a place where he was known, as he feared that otherwise we might be mobbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>By rapid driving he reached this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>Drawing up before the door of a tavern, we immediately dismounted, and were invited to enter by a house-servant, who led us to a small fire at which we might warm ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1562"/>As we sat there, a hard-looking female came in, and seeing my hand bound up, asked me what ailed it. I responded that I had caught cold in an old bruise which had assumed somewhat the character of a felon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1563"/>She inquired if she could do anything for it. I thanked her, and told her that I had a poultice of sweet gum on it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/>We were presently shown up to our chamber, and went to bed. My hand pained me so much, however, that I could not sleep; and getting up, I took a pan of water, and putting into it a lump of opium, which I obtained from my comrade, I laid my hand in it, and so passed the remainder of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/><pb id="p.180" n="180"/> </p> 
<p>We resumed our journey at an early hour, and pressed forward in order to reach the railroad, which was not quite finished to Hockinsville.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/><quote>I don't take no papers!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/>he rejoined; <quote>I can't read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>The sheriff told him that <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> I was a Virginian, and of like sentiments with himself, and so forth, but it did not effect much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>I would state his name; but, for the same reason that I suppress the sheriff's, I must also omit his. Stepping back to where he had set down a basket, <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> my old acquaintance brought me some biscuits and roast chicken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>After this welcome gift had been properly attended to, the donor introduced me to his lady, who was a fine, intelligent looking person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Her husband then taking his seat beside me, we fell into conversation, the chances of being overheard being small, on account of the noise made by the train.

<p>At this moment the cars started, and he, bidding us another good-bye, leaped off, and we saw him no more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>Soon after this little incident, my friend, the sheriff, got a paper which he handed to me.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>I knew instantly that I had been reported by <pb id="p.187" n="187"/> the man that I mentioned in the beginning of my narrative as having been a deceiver.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>He had measured me in <placeName reg="Columbus, Lowndes, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056204">Columbus</placeName> jail, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and, as I was in my bare feet at the time, this measurement was short, as by all military standards I always measured <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>There were other unpleasant items in this paper, the principal <num value="1">one</num> of which was that in reference to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0018.0016.00187.00190" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s retreat from before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>In due season we arrived at the end of our journey, <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>In conferring with the sheriff on the subject of our future course, I told him it would be best for his own safety to take us to the prison as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>This he did; and it was but a short time after, that we were again face to face with the tyrant <rs>Rylander</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>He sent us under a guard of <num value="4">four</num> men to our cells, where the jailor came and robbed us of our money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>He took also our watches, which until now we had succeeded in carrying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>We were then heavily ironed, and left in those filthy cells with only a little straw to lie upon, and this full of odious vermin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>We ascertained that it was true concerning <persName n="Crawford,Captain,Clay,,," id="n0018.0016.00187.00191" reg="default:Crawford,Clay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Clay</foreName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName>'s recapture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>He belonged to a Missouri regiment, and was a <pb id="p.188" n="188"/> genteel, manly comrade, never, like most of his companions, jeering at religion or its advocates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>He was a graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and consequently a man well versed in military matters. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>Hearing of our return, <persName n="Crawford,Captain,,,," id="n0018.0016.00188.00192" reg="nearbymention:Crawford,Clay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName>, who was confined close to us, made himself known, and a conversation was shortly opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>We learned from him that he had succeeded in making his escape at the same time we did, dressed in a rebel uniform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>Going boldly to the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>'s office</orgName>, he passed himself off for a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName>, and obtained a pass to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, where he hoped to be able to get aboard a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> gunboat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>His knowledge of the <name>South</name> and <name>South</name>ern officers, and the fact that there was <persName n="Crawford,Captain,,,," id="n0018.0016.00188.00193" reg="nearbymention:Crawford,Clay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">a Captain</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName> in the rebel army, assisted him greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>In <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places through which he passed, he was in peril from Union sympathizers, who looked upon him as an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>In all these localities he found that all the young, able-bodied men had been swept into the army, while the old men who were left behind were very decided <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n0018.0016.00188.00194" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>This I may add was exactly my own experience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>I asked him what fare he got in prison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/><quote>Oh,</quote> said he, <quote>nothing but <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn-meal</rs> and maggots!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/><pb id="p.189" n="189"/> </p> 
<p>That he stated truth in regard to the food, I had ample proof, when at night a negro brought us some boiled colards, a species of cabbage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>He carried it in a dirty-looking bucket, mixed with corn bread, made of meal and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Producing <num value="2">two</num> tin plates, he put a mess of the colards on each, and then pushed them through the grating of our cell to us. The greens appeared to have been boiled with something like meat, or rather scraps of refuse fat, certainly not fit for anything save soap-grease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>On close inspection of the mess, we could see the maggots, which, by way of curiosity, we commenced to pick out. By the time we had picked out half a teaspoonful of large fat ones &mdash; not skippers, but, maggots-our stomachs, hungry as they were, sickened, and we could not touch the horrid food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>We then examined our haversacks and a pillow-slip that old <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Kate</foreName></persName> had given us. In the latter, as much to our gratification as surprise, we found <num value="2">two</num> fine roasted chickens, and plenty of elegant corn-bread made with molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>After enjoying this good fare, we knelt and raised our voices in thanks to the <rs>Lord</rs>, who still watched and guarded us. We felt very happy, and made the misty old prison ring again with our hymns of praise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>The night passed slowly, for my wounded <pb id="p.190" n="190"/> hand and foot pained me exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>With the return of daylight, conversation with <persName n="Crawford,Captain,,,," id="n0018.0016.00190.00195" reg="nearbymention:Crawford,Clay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName> was resumed, and we learned that in his cell with him was a man named <persName n="Rowley,,,,," id="n0018.0016.00190.00196" reg="mostcommon:Rowley,nomatch:0"><surname>Rowley</surname></persName>, who was from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>He, like ourselves, had attempted to pass the lines, but was recaptured in the act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Originally residing in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, taking no part in the war, and attending quietly to his own business, he had been suddenly arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>The circumstances thereof were as follows: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>So unexpected and so fierce was the attack, that his wife, who was in a delicate condition of health at the time, sank swooning to the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1664"/>The astonished husband, not stopping to defend himself, sprang to the assistance of his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1665"/>While thus engaged, his assailants seized him, and roughly binding his hands behind him, dragged him from the house, and mounted him upon a mule, which they immediately drove off with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1666"/>When thus ruthlessly torn from the bosom of his family, he was looking forward with a husband's fond anxiety to the moment which was to make him a father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>And now, more than <num value="11">eleven</num> <pb id="p.191" n="191"/> months had passed away, but he had never heard any tidings of his family or property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>He owned several slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1669"/>Whether his loving wife had survived the shock she had received on the night in question, or whether the angels of a merciful <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had carried her own soul, and that <num value="1">one</num> yet unborn, away to heaven, he did not know. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1670"/>His captors had taken him to a negro jail, and cast him into a filthy cell, in which he laid for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, eating nor drinking nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1671"/>By this time, they deemed him sufficiently reduced to become subservient to their will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1672"/>They accordingly took him from his cell, and brought him to a man they styled <quote><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1673"/>By this man he was ordered to take a certain oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1674"/>Upon his refusal, he was shown a rope that had been used in the execution of <num value="4">four</num> of his neighbors, and he was informed that it was still strong enough to hang him. The man who held the rope strode toward him for the purpose of placing it around his neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1675"/>Thus convinced that there was something more than menace meant, he attempted to reason with his brutal captors, informing them that he was so bewildered that he did not comprehend what they wished him to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1676"/>The person called <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> thereupon ordered <pb id="p.192" n="192"/> him to be remanded to his cell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1677"/>The next day, hearing that the <rs>Union</rs> forces were approaching them, they hurried their poor prisoner to <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1678"/>This man gave me accounts of the most horrid scenes that he had witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1679"/>At <num value="1">one</num> period, he said that it was certain death for a man to refuse to volunteer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1680"/>Our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day of imprisonment passed dully enough, and indeed it would have been much worse, but for the converse we held with <persName n="Crawford,Captain,,,," id="n0018.0016.00192.00197" reg="nearbymention:Crawford,Clay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName> and <persName n="Rowley,Mister,,,," id="n0018.0016.00192.00198" reg="mostcommon:Rowley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rowley</surname></persName>, whose principal theme was the lightness of their rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>About this time, an occurrence took place which I here record, to show the workings of that pernicious system which is the real root of all our national troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>I was standing at the bars of my cell, looking out into the prison yard, and saw Woods, the jailor, order the negro, who used to wait on us, to bring him an ax. Upon receiving it, he deliberately broke off the lock of a trunk that belonged to <persName n="Crawford,Captain,Clay,,," id="n0018.0018.00202.00212" reg="default:Crawford,Clay,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Clay</foreName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName>, and took therefrom a watch and several cards of jewelry.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> after, a party of men came for the trunk, and found it broken open, as I have stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>They, of course, called the jailor to account, and he was fairly implicated in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>Without hesitation, however, the vile <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> robber accused the poor negro of having committed the act. Of course the latter denied the charge, and told the whole truth about it. This enraged Woods, and he tied him up to a rough timber cross so that, while his arms were stretched to their utmost extent, his toes barely touched the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>He then took a heavy whip, with <num value="3">three</num> thongs, and lashed the unfortunate negro until his shirt was actually soaked in blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Occasionally the monster ceased a moment, and bade the victim of his brutality to confess to the deed; but with the most heroic fortitude the poor slave refused to comply, and Woods, finding that he could not succeed thus, untied the bleeding man, and threw him into the cell next to our own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>Between us there was only an iron grating, so that we could converse with the negro, and see with our own eyes the horrible treatment to which he had been subjected. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>As he was regarded, however, as a Yankee, his word had no more effect <pb id="p.204" n="204"/> than the negro's. As I gazed upon the quivering back of that poor, downtrodden <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName>, I exclaimed, in the words of <persName n="Pringle,,Thomas,,," id="n0018.0018.00204.00215" reg="default:Pringle,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Pringle</surname></persName>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>I was scarcely fit to be seen, for I was yet clothed in the wretched rags in which I had lived for several months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>However, I said nothing, but, called, in very positive tones, for a guard to accompany me to the military prison, which was near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>As I was going thither, the thought that the poor negro was to be tried <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> that day for the offence which had been really committed by his master, shot across my mind, and I resolved that I would do my duty in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>I instantly returned to the commandant, and asked him to give me a parole of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>A large proportion of the prisoners in <placeName key="tgn,7013980" n="1.000 4" reg="macon, bibb, georgia">Macon</placeName> were nearly naked, and actually were obliged to wrap rags of blankets about themselves to hide their nakedness, and many times, while listening to their stories of wrong and woe, I was moved to tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>Among several harrowing incidents, about this time occurred the shooting of <num value="1">one</num> of our party, a political prisoner, if I remember right, who was deaf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>A brutal guard had fired on him because he did not obey some order which he had given, but which of course, the victim did not hear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>I saw the poor fellow writhing in his death-agonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>The shot had pierced directly through his bowels, inflicting a horrid and mortal wound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>Another man named Flood, for the offence of coming nearer than <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> to the guardlines, was pinned down to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>As this punishment is doubtless not understood by a <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> majority of readers, I will describe it. The person subjected to it is thrown to the ground, either face or back down, according to the whim of the punisher, and while held in this position, a number of stakes or wooden pins are driven in the earth around him, in such a manner as to bind him immovably to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>A more terrible punishment can scarcely be conceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>Flood was a large man, and possessed of immense strength; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time he was thus pinned down, he tore himself loose from his fastenings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>Upon seeing this, his captors again seized him. But he struggled manfully, and it was not until <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> powerful men attacked him simultaneously, and with weapons, that he was secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>This done, however, they obtained stakes that an ox could not have broken, and with these they fastened their victim down so firmly, that it was impossible for him to move half an inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>And in this position, he lay face down for <hi rend="italics"><measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure></hi>, during which time a heavy rain fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>In consequence he took a fatal cold, and, <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> later, he was laid in the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>This punishment was quite common among the rebels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>While listening to the accounts of my fellow-prisoners, especially concerning the deaf man <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> and Flood, I could not help thinking bitterly of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> in the free <rs>North</rs>, who, while our country is struggling for existence, are apologizing for the vile system which breeds such monsters as I have been describing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>Oh reader, if you would be just to yourself and to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and not allow your mind to be influenced by the fallacies with which traitors would delude you, you would at once perceive the fountain-spring of all our national troubles to be naught else but slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>And here, at the expense of interrupting my personal narrative, I have concluded to advance some facts and arguments in support of my conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>It is a most common and dangerous fallacy to condemn the emancipation theory of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0018.0019.00212.00219" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, as the cause of this terrible bloodshed that has been going on for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>Now I assume the opposite side of the argument, and find myself supported therein, not only by common sense, but all the teachings of past history. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>In <dateStruct value="1793-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1793">1793</year></dateStruct>, a civil war occurred between the aristocrats and republicans of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, and the planters called in the aid of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>The opposing party proclaimed freedom to all slaves, and armed them against the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>It is generally supposed that the abolition of slavery in <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> was in consequence of insurrection among the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>Nothing is farther from the truth, for the whole measure was nothing more nor less than <num value="1">one</num> of political expediency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>A little research into the histories of the island about this period will show that the whole colored population remained faithful to the republicans to whom they owed their liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>The <rs>British</rs> were defeated, and were obliged to evacuate the island; but they still held possession of the ocean, and consequently troubled the <rs>French</rs> to such an extent, that the latter were entirely unable to look after <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>The colonists were therefore left to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>Certainly here was an opportunity for the breaking forth of that dreaded insurrection which had been predicted as the sure result of immediate abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>I asked him why. <pb id="p.280" n="280"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/><quote>Why,</quote> replied he, <quote>look how you are voting over there.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/></p> 
<p>I did not say much, for nothing that could have been said would have done the rebel captain any good, and might perhaps have brought harm to me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>We were obliged to cross the city to reach the <rs type="place">Richmond depot</rs>, and on our way we passed by a large factory building, in which were confined a large number both of blacks and whites, the negroes for endeavoring to get away, and the whites for their Union sentiments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>During our march to the depot, we were surrounded by a strong guard of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>Oh, how galling it was to me think that I, a native born Virginian, was thus driven through the streets of the principal city of the Old Dominion, without a shoe on my foot, scarcely rags enough to satisfy decency, and soaked by a cold, heavy rain! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>At night, we were shut up in an old building that had been used for storing tobacco and molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>As there were a large number of prisoners here, awaiting exchange, every <num value="1">one</num> was obliged to shift for a resting-place as well as he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>Of course all the best spots were appropriated before our arrival, and we were forced to take up our quarters in the back part of the <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>A few of the blankets captured by the rebels at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> were distributed among us; but I, unfortunately, did not get <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>So, suffering much from the cold, I laid down in the dirt and molasses, which formed a sort of soft cement of an inch or <num value="2">two</num> in depth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>Completely wearied out, however, I soon fell asleep, and dreamed of the happy home in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> to which I was going. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>The next morning I was roughly aroused by <num value="2">two</num> men who stood on either side of me with barrel-staves. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>I had positively stuck so fast to the floor, that it was only after the most strenuous exertions I succeeded in getting loose, even with the aid of my <num value="2">two</num> rough helpers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>Our descriptive list did not come until <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>; but when it did, we were not long in signing it, after which we were taken to <placeName reg="Varina Grove, Henrico, Virginia" key="tgn,2743453">Aiken's Landing</placeName>, some <placeName><distance reg="14miles">fourteen miles</distance> <offset>southeast</offset> of  <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>Though a cold rain was still falling <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> at intervals, I did not complain, for I was going home,--thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>home! </p> 
<p>Oh, how overflowing was my heart with joy at the prospect!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Every drop of rain that pattered on my shivering form, fell upon me like the summer shower falls upon the parched and thirsty grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>I did not complain that I had to march the whole <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> through the cold, mud, and snow, in my bare feet, for I knew that this was my last hardship. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>Our guard were not at all rigorous in our marching, and therefore, I often had an opportunity to converse with the teamsters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>We wept, and laughed, and shook hands, and bounded with delight, until some time after we were taken aboard the <rs>Federal</rs> transport, which had been sent up the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act upon landing and reaching <placeName reg="Willard's Hotel">Willard's Hotel</placeName>, was to secure the services of a photographer, who took myself and comrade with the chain about our necks, and in our rebel rags, exactly as is represented in the engraving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>The next important operation was to clean myself, trim my beard and hair, and make myself fit to go into decent society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>This was by no means a small undertaking; but by dint of scrub-brushes, soaps of incredible strength, and exercise of muscle to an indefinite extent, I at last succeeded in accomplishing my objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2511"/>As I left the bathroom, I noticed at the other <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> end of the hall, a tall strange gentleman, who, for all I did not recognize him, seemed familiar to me. However, I walked toward him, and he did the same, coming toward me. When I got sufficiently near to address him, I bowed and extended my hand, He did exactly the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2512"/>I thought he was behaving very strangely, and with rather a grim smile I drew back and raised myself to my full height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>He did exactly the same, and I suddenly discovered that I had been the victim of a huge mirror, and that I had, all the while, been mistaking myself for a clever, gentlemanly-looking old friend of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>I merely relate this circutance to prove to the reader, that a man who is unfortunate enough to spend <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> in Dixie, is scarcely able to recognize himself upon his return home. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>Home! home! that word still sounds with strange music in my ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2517"/>Home! ah, that is but another name for the dear being, who, while I lay wounded and languishing in the loathsome jails of a merciless enemy, cared for the sweet babes <pb id="p.285" n="285"/> of the captive, who taught their little lips to add a prayer for papa to their vesper offerings at the mercy-seat, and who, weary with many months of watching, never ceased to treasure in her heart's holiest recesses him who pens this tribute.</p>
