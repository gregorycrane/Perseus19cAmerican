<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The late civil war which raged in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has been very generally attributed to the abolition of slavery as its cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>When we consider how deeply the institutions of southern society and the operations of southern industry were founded in slavery, we must admit that this was cause enough to have produced such a result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>But great and wide as was that cause in its far-reaching effects, a close study of the history of the times will bring us to the conclusion that it was the fear of a mischief far more extensive and deeper even than this which drove cool and reflecting minds in the <rs>South</rs> to believe that it was better to make the death struggle at once than submit tamely to what was inevitable, unless its coming could be averted by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Men, too old to be driven blindly by passion; women, whose gentle and kindly instincts were deeply impressed by the horrors of war, and young men, with fortune and position yet to be won in an open and inviting field, if peace could be maintained so as to secure the opportunities of liberty and fair treatment, united in the common cause and determined to make a holocaust of all that was dear to them on the altars of war sooner than submit without resentment to the loss of liberty, honor and property by a cruel abuse of power and a breach of plighted faith on the part of those who had professed to enter with them into a union of justice and fraternal affection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>When this Union was originally formed, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> embraced too many degrees of latitude and longitude, and too many varieties of climate and production, to make it practicable to establish and administer justly <num value="1">one</num> common government which should take charge of all the interests of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>To the wise men who were entrusted with the formation of that union and common government it was obvious enough that each separate society should be entrusted with the management of its own peculiar interests and <pb id="p.2" n="2"/>that the united government should take charge only of those interests which were common and general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>To enforce this necessary distinction, it was provided that all powers, not specially granted, should be reserved to the people and the <name>States</name>, and a list of the granted powers was carefully and specifically made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But <num value="2">two</num> parties soon arose in regard to these limitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Those who wielded the powers thus granted became interested to remove these limitations as far as possible, whilst the minority, who belonged to the governed rather than the governing party, early learned to regard these limitations as the best and surest defences against the abuses and oppression of a despotic majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>A tendency soon became manifest in the non-slaveholding portion of the union to constitute themselves into that governing party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Endowed with the greater share of power in the commencement, that preponderance was increased by the course of events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The famous northwestern ordinance, to which the old <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> fathers were driven by their abhorrence of slavery, without looking too closely to its probable consequences, made the predominance of the non-slaveholding section in the government irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The abolition of the slave-trade, after a time, by the constitution and the northwestern ordinance, left the growing superiority of that section not even doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But the acquisition of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> made another order of growth in political power possible as between the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The bare possibility of such a result kindled a violent opposition in some portions of the non-slaveholding section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> it was particularly angry, and there sprung up for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the history of our government audible threats of separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <quote>land hunger</quote> of the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race, as <persName n="Parker,,Theodore,,," id="n0001.0002.00002.00004" reg="default:Parker,Theodore,,,"><foreName>Theodore</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName> calls it, soon quieted the opposition to the acquisition of territory, but a far more bitter strife arose as to the equal rights of the <num value="2">two</num> sections to settle the vacant territory of the <rs>Union</rs> and grow possibly <hi rend="italics">part passu</hi> in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>So fierce was the strife, and so loud its tumult, that for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time it broke upon <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0002.00002.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>'s ear like <quote>a fire bell in the night.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The contest between the <num value="2">two</num> sections over the limitations in the constitution upon the governing party under it began with the commencement of its history, and ended only, as I shall presently show, with the revolution which destroyed the old form and established the despotism of a majority of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is in the history of this contest we must look for the true causes of the war, and the use made of the victory by the winning party will show the object and nature of that contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>When it became obvious that the only protection of <pb id="p.3" n="3"/>the rights of the minority against the encroachments of the majority was to be found in the limitations upon the power of the governing party, a death struggle arose between the <num value="2">two</num> parties over the constitutional restraints upon this power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The struggle between the <num value="2">two</num> parties commenced at the beginning of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>These were respectively led by <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00003.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00003.00007" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:2"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, the <num value="1">one</num> with an avowed preference for monarchy, the other the great apostle of democracy &mdash; men of signal abilities, and each conscious of what would be the consequence of complete and perfect victory on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The party of power showed a constant tendency to draw all important subjects of jurisdiction within the vortex of Federal control, and an equally persevering effort on the other to limit that control to the strict necessities of a common government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A great leader, who came into the contest and figured in it until it was well nigh ended, used to say that in all good governments there existed a tax-consuming and a tax-paying party, between whom a constant conflict existed, and in the history of that conflict the history of party strife would be found to consist; but when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acquired complete supremacy the nature, if not the form of the government &mdash; if it was originally republican &mdash; was sure to change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The leaders of the <orgName n="States Rights party" type="party">States rights party</orgName>, aware of this tendency, as the contest went on, became more and more anxious to preserve their constitutional defences, and loudly proclaimed the danger of yielding them up. Time and again they proclaimed that the worst of all governments was that of a majority of numbers with absolute and unrestricted powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Despotism of all sorts was bad, but the despotism of a majority of numbers in a democratic form of government was the worst of all &mdash; particularly was that the case in regard to slavery, as was often asserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In <dateStruct value="1790-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, when <num value="2">two</num> abolition petitions, <num value="1">one</num> of them signed by <persName n="Franklin,Doctor,,,," id="n0001.0002.00003.00008" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, were presented to Congress, that body <quote>resolved that Congress had no authority to interfere in the emancipation of slaves, or even the treatment of them within any of the <name>States</name>, it remaining with the several States alone to provide any regulations therein which humanity or true policy may require.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Congress thus clearly declared its view of its power over the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Congress was petitioned to do all in its power to discourage slavery, of which a Massachusetts man, in an able history of the long contest, has said: <quote>Congress could not move a hair's breadth towards discouraging it, either lawfully or honestly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The powers of Congress being defined and nominated by the constitution which framed the government, all it could do in <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>regard to any specific subject was to act upon it, if within its province, and if otherwise, <quote>to touch not, taste not, handle not.</quote></quote> (<persName n="Lunt,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00004.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lunt,nomatch:0"><surname>Lunt</surname></persName>'s Origin of the <rs>Late War</rs>, <ref n="page 25">p. 25</ref>.) In the debate upon the subject, <num value="1">one</num> Southern gentleman objected to the commitment of these memorials as containing <quote>unconstitutional requests,</quote> and said <quote>he feared the commitment would be a very alarming circumstance to the <rs>Southern States</rs>; for if it was to engage Congress in an unconstitutional measure, it would be considered an interference with their rights, making them uneasy under the government, and causing them to lament that they had ever put additional power into their hands.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Another declared <quote>that the <name>States</name> would never have entered into the confederacy unless their property had been guaranteed to them, and that we look upon this measure as an attack upon the <hi rend="italics">palladium</hi> of our property</quote> --meaning the constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Another said if he was to hold these slaves in eternal bondage he would feel no uneasiness on account of the present menace, <quote><hi rend="italics">because he would rely upon the virtue of Congress that they would not exercise any unconstitutional authority</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This same historian well says <quote>the impression made upon the southern members of Congress at the earliest period is also significant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Although evidently considering it of no practical importance, they yet clearly made it known they regarded such action as in violation of the constitution, and that without the guaranty for their rights of property in slaves, permitted by that instrument, the <name>States</name> which they represented would not have assented to it, and hence the plan for the <rs>Union</rs> must have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can doubt that if they had deemed the guaranty afforded insufficient they could have obtained pledges of a still more precise character, either then or at a later period, since the object of the <rs>Union</rs> was <num value="1">one</num> of paramount interest to all. But neither they nor their northern compatriots entertained any question of the fidelity of their successors to engagements so solemnly undertaken both express and implied.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>(<persName n="Lunt,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00004.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lunt,nomatch:0"><surname>Lunt</surname></persName>, <ref n="page 27">p. 27</ref>.) The history of this transaction shows how early the <rs>South</rs> was taught to look to the constitution for the defences of their rights in regard to slavery, how fully, too, and clearly the <rs>Congress</rs> admitted the existence of these defences, and that the <rs>South</rs> disregarded the unauthorized menace of these <quote>anarchic <persName><foreName>Quakers</foreName></persName>,</quote> as <persName n="Carlisle,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00004.00011" reg="mostcommon:Carlisle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlisle</surname></persName> calls them, because they <quote><hi rend="italics">relied upon the virtue of Congress that they would not exercise any unconstitutional authority</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Their property in slaves was guaranteed by the constitution; they felt authorized to say so by a solemn declaration of Congress made at the time; and they had <pb id="p.5" n="5"/>too much confidence in the northern majority, who were soon to control that body, to believe that directly or indirectly they would impair or destroy a right so solemnly guaranteed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>To have anticipated such an attack upon their property and peace, would have been to suppose that they had been made the easy victims of a perfidy, which, under all the circumstances, under all the traditions of common sufferings and exertions, was characterized by a wealth of deception which would have excited the envy even of a Carthagenian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Especially would that be the case if the deceit was to be covered up by a constant course of perjury on the part of the officials of the government, who were to be sworn as a qualification for office to support the constitution which contained that pledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>How justly our fathers relied upon that instrument to protect their rights, subsequent history has shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Nothing could be more clearly established than the right on <num value="1">one</num> side to reclaim fugitive slaves, and the obligation on the other to return them &mdash; an obligation which surely ought to have rested lightly enough on those who brought them here and sold them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Nor is it easy to see how the remorse for having sold them could be relieved by inveigling them away from those who had bought them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But so it was, that during the existence of slavery there was an ever-living contest between the slave and the free States on this very subject; the former seeking to enforce, and the latter to evade the constitutional obligation for the return of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Long before the secession of the slave States, it had become almost impossible, without the assistance of armed forces, to reclaim a fugitive slave openly in the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><persName n="Lunt,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00005.00012" reg="mostcommon:Lunt,nomatch:0"><surname>Lunt</surname></persName>, <ref n="page 320">p. 320</ref>, says: <quote>At length <num value="14">fourteen</num> of the <num value="16">sixteen</num> free States had provided statutes which rendered any attempt to execute the fugitive slave act so difficult as to be practically impossible, and placed each of those States in an attitude of virtual resistance to the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>When <persName n="Toombs,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0002.00005.00013" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,Gabriel,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, in the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, during the session in which he withdrew from that body, referred to these laws and taxed the free States with their violations of constitutional obligation, in evidence of which he produced these statutes, it was pitiful to hear the excuses by which the representatives of these States sought to squirm out of the difficulty &mdash; a difficulty for which the executives of <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName> would scarcely have cared to apologize, if it be true, as doubtless it is, as <persName n="Lunt,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00005.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lunt,nomatch:0"><surname>Lunt</surname></persName> states, that <quote>at a somewhat later period those officers refused to surrender to justice persons charged with participation in the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid</quote> --see note, <ref n="page 320">p. 320</ref>. At the era of secession the <pb id="p.6" n="6"/>constitution had not only ceased to be a palladium for these rights of secession, but was hardly recognized to be binding at all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If, then, this instrument was to be relied upon by the slave States to protect them, it was only in the event that they could arm themselves with enough political power to enforce its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>So obvious had this become by <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1820--"><year reg="1820">20</year></dateStruct>, when the <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">State of Missouri</placeName> was struggling for admission as a slave State, that the slave States at that time solemnly asserted their right to settle the unoccupied and unappropriated territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with their slave property, under the protection of its laws &mdash; a right which was as vehemently denied by the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>So bitter and fierce was this contest, that its agitations shook the very foundations of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was settled for a time by a compromise excluding slavery from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Territories north of a line <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime; north latitude, and admitting it south of that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Even this line left the <rs>South</rs> in a condition of hopeless inferiority, which was but little helped by the acquisition of a portion of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> as a slave State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When the vast territory obtained from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> at the close of the war was organized, the <rs>Missouri</rs> compromise line was set aside, and the non-intervention principle was adopted, by which it became between the sections a mere question of the ability to colonize &mdash; a question in regard to which there could scarcely be a doubt, with the superior resources in wealth and population of the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It had become manifest that the <rs>South</rs> had no protection for its rights but the constitution, nor could it hope to avail itself of that protection without an increase of power in the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Its hopes for acquiring that were daily becoming less, whilst sectional animosities were constantly becoming more angry and bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A party had sprung up which proclaimed the constitution to be <quote>an agreement with death and a covenant with hell.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>This party was daily becoming stronger and more dangerous in spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It began at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by taking part in the contests between Whigs and Democrats, and grew upon the agitations in Congress and the newspaper press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>This war of petitions for abolition was commenced by <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n0001.0002.00006.00015" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, when he presented a petition from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> for the abolition of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, but at the same time declared that he could not vote for it. He who was so denounced when he left the <orgName n="Federal party" type="party">Federal party</orgName>, on account of its disunion tendencies, and joined the <rs>Democratic</rs> under <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0002.00006.00016" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, became the <quote>old man eloquent</quote> when he fanned the smouldering spark of sectional division with the burning breath of hate and anger <pb id="p.7" n="7"/>which was yet to burst out in flames and consume the house with the fire whose initial spark he consented to bear and apply to the family dwelling, ever nursing the fire until the building was fairly ablaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>And what was now, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, the worth of the reliance which kept the <rs>South</rs> quiet in <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, because it <quote>relied upon the virtue of Congress that it would exercise no unconstitutional authority?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>In regard to the right to recapture fugitive slaves, it was at that time obviously a dead better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The free States had violated that obligation by their personal liberty statutes, which were consonant with the general spirit of their people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName>, which denounced the constitution as a <quote>covenant with death and an agreement with hell,</quote> was fast growing in power and influence in the free States, and threatened to become the most powerful political organization within their borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> had adopted resolutions by her legislature, with the assent of her governor &mdash; if his message represented his opinions &mdash; resolutions which were denounced at the time as being of a disunion character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Her senator, <persName n="Bates,,,,," id="n0001.0002.00007.00017" reg="mostcommon:Bates,Samuel,P.,,:1"><surname>Bates</surname></persName>, presented them in silence, and <persName n="King,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0002.00007.00018" reg="mostcommon:King,William,R.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>King</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, regretted that a proposition should come from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs>.

All hope of acquiring any additional political strength by the <rs>South</rs> to defend their rights was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The free States had announced their determination to exclude slavery from the territories of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and they had the strength to do it, if they believed, as they affected to do, that the constitution was no obstacle in their path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The right of growth was thus denied to the power of the slaveholding States, and with the state of feeling then existing and cherished, they had nothing to expect but to be dwarfed and oppressed, judging of the future by the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Indeed, an armed invasion of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had been just made by <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0001.0002.00007.00020" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, with the avowed purpose of exciting servile insurrection, and although suppressed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and State forces, it excited no such outburst of horror and denunciation at the <rs>North</rs> as it might reasonably be expected to have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>On the contrary, he seemed to have been considered more as a martyr perishing in a great and holy cause, than a criminal seeking to excite a servile war, whose victims were to be women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Who drove the <rs>South</rs> to these extremities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The very men who accuse her of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>When she accepted the contest, to which she was thus virtually invited on terms of contumelious threat and reproach, she was threatened with being wiped out and annihilated by the superior resources of her antagonist, with whom it was vain and foolish to contend, so unequal were the strength and resources of the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Probably few men foresaw the extent or the bitterness of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Physically, she was unable to stand up under such a weight of human beings, gathered from wherever they could be called by appeals to their passions or bought by a promise to supply their necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The South being forced to accept those terms to obtain it, the <rs>North</rs> was not afraid to avow its purposes and carry them out. Slavery was abolished without compensation, and slaves were awarded equal rights with their masters in the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It was the fear of <pb id="p.12" n="12"/>these results which drove the <rs>South</rs> into the war. Experience proved that this fear was reasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The war was alleged as the excuse for such proceedings; but can any man doubt that the <rs>North</rs> would have done the same thing if all constitutional restraints upon the power of the majority had been peaceably removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>To submit peaceably to the unlimited power of the majority was plainly to submit to these consequences or any other action which this majority may strongly desire to take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It is sought to be excused, I know, by assuming that these things were done with the assent of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>That these constitutional amendments represent the well considered opinion of any respectable party in the <rs>South</rs>, there is none so infatuated as to believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>They were accepted as the terms of the conqueror, and so let them be considered by all who desire to know the true history of their origin.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>To introduce hostile and conflicting statements in the formation of the public opinion, by which the action of the <rs>South</rs> was to be regulated, might, indeed, weaken and injure that section, but how it would help or. benefit the <rs>North</rs> is yet to be seen, if it should so turn out. I think I have shown that the <rs>South</rs> had good reason to believe that the <rs>North</rs> meditated the infliction of these things, and that there was but little hope of finding any defence against them in the constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The alacrity with which she put these designs into execution so soon as our conquest enabled her to do so, proves that we did not suspect her wrongfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>She fought to avert these injuries, and because she was unwilling to remain under the government of a majority with unlimited powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>What this latter change threatens remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The assumption of such a power would be the assertion of a prerogative claimed by the <rs>British Government</rs> to legislate for the colonies in all cases whatever; it would constitute of itself a dangerous attack on the rights of the <name>States</name>, and should be promptly repelled.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Not the whole people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, for there could be no oppression of the whole with their own consent; and it could not have entered into the conception of the convention that the powers <pb id="p.18" n="18"/>granted could not be resumed until the oppressor himself united in such resumption.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Called to the difficult and responsible station of Executive <rs type="role" reg="Chief">Chief</rs> of the <rs>Provisional Government</rs> which you have instituted, I approach the discharge of the duties assigned me with an humble distrust of my abilities, but with a sustaining confidence in the wisdom of those who are to aid and guide me in the administration of public affairs, and an abiding faith in the patriotism and virtue of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Looking forward to the speedy establishment of a provisional government to take the place of the present <num value="1">one</num>, and which, by its great moral and physical powers, will be better able to contend with the difficulties which arise from the conflicting interests of separate nations, I enter upon the duties of the office for which I have been chosen with the hope that the beginning of our career as a Confederacy may not be obstructed by hostile opposition to the enjoyment of that separate and independent existence which we have asserted, and which, with the blessing of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, we intend to maintain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Our present position has been achieved in a manner unprecedented in the history of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It illustrates the <rs>American</rs> idea that government rests upon the consent of the governed, and that it is the right of the people to alter or abolish a government whenever it becomes destructive of the ends for which it was established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The declared purposes of the compact of Union from which we have withdrawn were to establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, to provide for the common defence, to promote the general welfare, and to secure the blessings of liberty for ourselves and our posterity; and when in the judgment of the sovereign States now <pb id="p.20" n="20"/>comprising this Confederacy it had been perverted from the purposes for which it was ordained, and had ceased to answer the ends for which it was established, an appeal to the ballot-box declared that so far as they were concerned the government created by that compact should cease to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>In this they merely asserted a right which the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> defined to be inalienable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Of the time and occasion for its exercise, they, as sovereign, were the final judges each for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The impartial and enlightened verdict of mankind will vindicate the rectitude of our conduct, and He who knows the hearts of men will judge the sincerity with which we have labored to preserve the government of our fathers, in its spirit and in those rights inherent in it, which were solemnly proclaimed at the birth of the <name>States</name>, and which have been affirmed and re-affirmed in the <name>Bills</name> of Rights of the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>When they entered into the <rs>Union</rs> of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, it was with the undeniable recognition of the power of the people to resume the authority delegated for the purposes of that government, whenever, in their opinion, its functions were perverted and its ends defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>By virtue of this authority, the time and occasion requiring them to exercise it having arrived, the sovereign States here represented have seceded from that Union, and it is a gross abuse of language to denominate the act rebellion or revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>They have formed a new alliance, but in each State its government has remained as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The rights of person and property have not been disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The agency through which they have communicated with foreign powers has been changed, but this does not necessarily interrupt their international relations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Sustained by a consciousness that our transition from the former Union to the present Confederacy has not proceeded from any disregard on our part of our just obligations, or any failure to perform every constitutional duty &mdash; moved by no intention or design to invade the rights of others &mdash; anxious to cultivate peace and commerce with all nations &mdash; if we may not hope to avoid war, we may at least expect that posterity will acquit us of having needlessly engaged in it. We are doubly justified by the absence of wrong on our part, and by wanton aggression on the part of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>There can be no cause to doubt that the courage and patriotism of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will be found equal to any measures of defence which may be required for their security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Devoted to agricultural pursuits, their chief interest is the export of a commodity required in every manufacturing country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Our policy is peace, and <pb id="p.21" n="21"/>the freest trade our necessities will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>It is alike our interest, and that of all those to whom we would sell and from whom we would buy, that there should be the fewest practicable restrictions upon interchange of commodities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It must follow, therefore, that mutual interest would invite good will and kindness between them and us. If, however, passion or lust of dominion should cloud the judgment and inflame the ambition of these States, we must prepare to meet the emergency, and maintain, by the final arbitrament of the sword, the position we have assumed among the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>We have now entered upon our career of independence, and it must be inflexibly pursued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Through many years of controversy with our late associates, the <rs>Northern States</rs>, we have vainly endeavored to secure tranquility and obtain respect for the rights to which we were entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>As a necessity, not a choice, we have resorted to separation, and henceforth our energies must be devoted to the conducting of our own affairs, and perpetuating the <rs>Confederacy</rs> we have formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>If a just perception of mutual interest shall permit us peaceably to pursue our separate political career, my most earnest desire will have been fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But if this be denied us, and the integrity and jurisdiction of our territory be assailed, it will but remain for us with a firm resolve to appeal to arms and invoke the blessings of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> upon a just cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>As a consequence of our new constitution, and with a view to meet our anticipated wants, it will be necessary to provide a speedy and efficient organization of the several branches of the executive departments having special charge of our foreign intercourse, financial and military affairs, and postal service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>For purposes of defence, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> may, under ordinary circumstances, rely mainly upon their militia; but it is deemed advisable, in the present condition of affairs, that there should be a well instructed, disciplined army, more numerous than would be usually required for a peace establishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>I also suggest that for the protection of our harbors and commerce on the high seas, a navy adapted to those objects be built up. These necessities have doubtless engaged the attention of Congress.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>With a constitution differing only in form from that of our forefathers, in so far as it is explanatory of their well known intents, <pb id="p.22" n="22"/>freed from sectional conflicts which have so much interfered with the pursuits of the general welfare, it is not unreasonable to expect that the <name>States</name> from which we have parted may seek to unite their fortunes with ours under the government we have instituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>For this your constitution has made adequate provision, but beyond this, if I mistake not the judgment and will of the people, our reunion with the <name>States</name> from which we have separated is neither practicable nor desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>To increase power, develop the resources, and promote the happiness of this Confederacy, it is necessary that there should be so much homogeniety as that the welfare of every portion be the aim of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>When this homogeniety does not exist, antagonisms are engendered which must and should result in separation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Actuated solely by a desire to protect and preserve our own rights and promote our own welfare, the secession of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has been marked by no aggression upon others, and followed by no domestic convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Our industrial pursuits have received no check; the cultivation of our fields has progressed as heretofore; and even should we be involved in war, there would be no considerable diminution in the production of the great staple which constitutes our exports, and in which the commercial world has an interest scarcely less than our own. This common interest of producer and consumer can only be interrupted by external force, which would obstruct shipments to foreign markets &mdash; a course of conduct which would be detrimental to manufacturing and commercial interests abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Should reason guide the action of the government from which we have separated, a policy so injurious to the civilized world, the <rs>Northern States</rs> included, could not be dictated even by the strongest desire to inflict injury upon us; but, if otherwise, a terrible responsibilisy will rest upon it, and the suffering of <num value="1000000">millions</num> will bear testimony to the folly and wickedness of our aggressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>In the meantime there will remain to us, besides the ordinary remedies before suggested, the well known resources for retaliation upon the commerce of our enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Experience in public stations of subordinate grade to this which your kindness has conferred on me, has taught me that care and toil and disappointments are the price of official elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>This step was taken reluctantly, by constraint, and after the exhaustion of every measure that was likely to secure us from interference with our property, equality in the <rs>Union</rs>, or exemption from submission to an alien Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The Southern States claimed only the unrestricted enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the <rs>Constitution Finding</rs>, by painful and protracted experience, that this was persistently denied, we determined to separate from those enemies who had manifested the inclination and ability to impoverish and destroy us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The unanimity and zeal with which the separation was undertaken and perfected, finds no parallel in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The people rose <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> to assert their liberties and protect their menaced rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>There never was before such universality of conviction among any people on any question involving so serious and so thorough a change of political and international relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>This grew out of the clearness of the right so to act, and the certainty of the perils of further association with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The <pb id="p.25" n="25"/>change was so wonderful, so rapid, so contrary to universal history, that many fail to see that all has been done in the logical sequence of principles, which are the highest testimony to the wisdom of our fathers, and the best illustration of the correctness of those principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>No attempt was made to build on <hi rend="italics">speculative</hi> principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The effort was confined within the narrowest limits of historical and constitutional right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>These reasonable anticipations were doomed to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>For such a war we were not prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The difference in military resources between our enemies and ourselves; the immense advantages possessed in the organized machinery of an established government; a powerful navy, the nucleus of an army, credit abroad, and illimitable facilities in mechanical and manufacturing power, placed them on <quote>the vantage ground.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>In our infancy, we were without a seaman or soldier, without revenue, without <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, without a recognized place in the family of nations, without external commerce, without foreign credit, with the prejudices of the world against us. While we were without manufacturing facilities to supply our wants, our ports were blockaded; we had to grapple with a giant adversary, defend <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">two thousand miles</measure> of seacoast, and an inland frontier of equal extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>If we had succeeded in preventing any successes on the part of our enemy, it would have been a miracle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>What we have accomplished, with a population so inferior in numbers and means so vastly disproportionate, has excited the astonishment and admiration of the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The war in which we are engaged was wickedly, and against all our protests and the most earnest efforts to the contrary, forced upon us. <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> sent a commission to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to adjust all questions of dispute between her and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of the <rs>Provisional Government</rs> was to accredit agents to visit <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and use all honorable means to obtain a satisfactory settlement of all questions of dispute with that government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Both efforts failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Commissioners were deceived and rejected, and clandestine but vigorous preparations were made for war. In proportion to our perseverance and anxiety have been the obstinacy and arrogance in spurning offers of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It seems we can be indebted for nothing to the virtues of our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We are obliged to <pb id="p.27" n="27"/>his vices, which have enured to our strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We owe as much to his insolence and blindness as to our precaution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The wager of battle having been tendered, it was accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The alacrity with which our people flew to arms is worthy of all praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Their deeds of heroic daring, patient endurance, ready submission to discipline, and numerous victories, are in keeping with the fervent patriotism that prompted their early volunteering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Quite recently,. scores of regiments have re-enlisted for the war, testifying their determination to fight until their liberties were achieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Coupled with, and contributing greatly to, this enthusiastic ardor, was the lofty courage, the indomitable resolve, the self-denying spirit of our noble women, who, by their labors of love, their patience of hope, their unflinching constancy, their uncomplaining submission to privations of the war, have shed an immortal lustre upon their sex and country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Our army is no hireling soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It comes not from paupers, criminals or emigrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It was originally raised by the free, unconstrained, unpurchasable assent of the men. All vocations and classes contributed to the swelling numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Abandoning luxuries and comforts to which they had been accustomed, they submitted cheerfully to the scanty fare and exactive service of the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Their services above price, the only remuneration they have sought is the protection of their altars, firesides and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>In the <name>Norwegian</name> wars, the actors were, every <num value="1">one</num> of them, named and patronymically described as the <rs>King</rs>'s friend and companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The same wonderful individuality has been seen in this war. Our soldiers are not a consolidated mass, an unthinking machine, but an army of intelligent units.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>To designate all who have distinguished themselves by special valor, would be to enumerate nearly all in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The generous rivalry between the troops from different States has prevented any special pre-eminence, and hereafter, for centuries to come, the gallant bearing and unconquerable devotion of Confederate soldiers will inspire the hearts and encourage the hopes, and strengthen the faith of all who labor to obtain their freedom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>For <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> this cruel war has been waged against us, and its continuance has been seized upon as a pretext by some discontented persons to excite hostility to the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Recent and public as have been the occurrences, it is strange that a misapprehension exists as to the conduct of the <num value="2">two</num> governments in reference to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Allusion has been made to the unsuccessful efforts, when separation took place, to procure an amicable adjustment of all matters in dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/><pb id="p.28" n="28"/>These attempts at negotiation do not comprise all that has been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>In every form in which expression could be given to the sentiment, in public meetings, through the press, by legislative resolves, the desire of this people for peace, for the uninterrupted enjoyment of their rights and prosperity, has been made known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, more authoritatively, in several of his messages, while protesting the utter absence of all desire to interfere with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or acquire any of their territory, has avowed that the <quote>advent of peace will be hailed with joy. Our desire for it has never been concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Our efforts to avoid the war, forced on us as it was by the lust of conquest and the insane passions of our foes, are known to mankind.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The course of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has proved that it did not desire peace, and would not consent to it on any terms that we could possibly concede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>In proof of this we refer to the repeated rejection of all terms of conciliation and compromise, to their recent contemptuous refusal to receive the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs>, who was sent to negotiate for softening the asperities of war, and their scornful rejection of the offer of a neutral power to mediate between the contending parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>If cumulative evidence be needed, it can be found in the following resolution, recently adopted by the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/><hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That as our country and the very existence of the best government ever instituted by man are imperilled by the most causeless and wicked rebellion that the world has seen, and believing as we do that the only hope of saving this country and preserving this government is by the power of the sword, we are for the most vigorous prosecution of the war until the constitution and the laws shall be enforced and obeyed in all parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and to that end we oppose any armistice, or intervention, or mediation, or proposition for peace, from any quarter, so long as there shall be found a rebel in arms against the government; and we ignore all party names, lines and issues, and recognize but <num value="2">two</num> parties in this war &mdash; patriots and traitors.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The motive of such strange conduct is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> was founded to destroy slavery and the equality of the <name>States</name>, and <name>Lincoln</name> was selected as the instrument to accomplish this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The Union was a barrier to the consummation of this policy, because the constitution, which was its bond, recognized and protected slavery and the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The Union must therefore be sacrificed, and to insure its destruction, war was determined on. <pb id="p.29" n="29"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The mass of the northern people were not privy to, and sympathized in no such design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They loved the <rs>Union</rs> and wished to preserve it. To rally the people to the support of the war, its object was proclaimed to be <quote>a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>,</quote> as if that which implied voluntary assent, of which agreement was an indispensable element and condition, could be preserved by coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It is absurd to pretend that a government, really desirous of restoring the <rs>Union</rs>, would adopt such measures as the confiscation of private property, the emancipation of slaves, systematic efforts to invite them to insurrection, forcible abduction from their homes, and compulsory enlistment in the army, the division of a sovereign State without its consent, and the proclamation that <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the population of a State, and that <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> under military rule, should control the will of the remaining <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The only relation possible between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, under such a policy, is that of conqueror and conquered, superior and dependent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Rest assured, fellow-citizens, that although restoration may still be used as a war-cry by the <rs>Northern Government</rs>, it is only to delude and betray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Fanaticism has summoned to its aid cupidity and vengeance; and nothing short of your utter subjugation, the destruction of your State governments, the overthrow of your social and political fabric, your personal and public degradation and ruin, will satisfy the demands of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Can there be a man so vile, so debased, so unworthy of liberty as to accept peace on such humiliating terms?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It would hardly be fair to assert that all the northern people participate in these designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>On the contrary, there exists a powerful <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> which openly condemns them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The administration has, however, been able thus far, by its enormous patronage and its lavish expenditures to seduce, or by its legions of <quote>Hessian</quote> mercenaries to overawe the masses, to control the elections and to establish an arbitrary despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It cannot be possible that this state of things can continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, accustomed to freedom, cannot consent to be ruined and enslaved in order to ruin and enslave us. Moral, like physical, epidemics, have their allotted periods, and must, sooner or later, be exhausted and disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>When reason returns, our enemies will probably reflect that a people like ours, who have exhibited such capabilities and extemporized such resources, can never be subdued; that a vast expanse of territory, with such a population, cannot be governed as an obedient colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Victory would not be conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The inextinguishable quarrel would be transmitted <quote>from bleeding sire to son,</quote> <pb id="p.30" n="30"/>and the struggle would be renewed between generations yet unborn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>To impoverish us would only be to dry up some of the springs of northern prosperity &mdash; to destroy southern wealth is to reduce northern profits, while the restoration of peace would necessarily re-establish some commercial intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>It may not be amiss, in this connection, to say that at <num value="1">one</num> time it was the wish and expectation of many at the <rs>South</rs> to form a treaty of amity and friendship with the northern States, by which both peoples might derive the benefits of commercial intercourse, and move on side by side in the arts of peace and civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>History has confirmed the lesson taught by Divine authority, that each nation, as well as each individual, should seek their happiness in the prosperity of others, and not in the injury or ruin of a neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The general welfare of all is the highest dictate of moral duty and economic policy, while a heritage of triumphant wrong is the greatest curse that can befall a nation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Until some evidence is given of a change of policy on the part of the government, and some assurance is received that efforts at negotiation will not be spurned, the <rs>Congress</rs> are of opinion that any direct overtures for peace would compromise our self-respect, be fruitless of good, and interpreted by the enemy as an indication of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>We can only repeat the desire of the people for peace, and our readiness to accept terms consistent with the honor and dignity and independence of the <name>States</name>, and compatible with the safety of our domestic institutions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Not content with rejecting all proposals for a peaceful settlement of the controversy, a cruel war of invasion was commenced, which, in its progress, has been marked by a brutality and disregard of the rules of civilized warfare that stand out in unexampled barbarity in the history of modern wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Accompanied by every act of cruelty and rapine, the conduct of the enemy has been destitute of that forbearance and magnanimity which civilization and Christianity have introduced to mitigate the asperities of war. The atrocities are too incredible for narration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Instead of a regular war, our resistance of the unholy efforts to crush out our national existence is treated as a rebellion, and the settled international rules between belligerents are ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Instead of conducting the war as betwixt <num value="2">two</num> military and political organizations, it is a war against the whole population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Houses are pillaged and burned; churches are defaced; towns are ransacked; clothing of women and infants is stripped from their persons; jewelry and mementoes of the dead are stolen; mills and implements of agriculture are destroyed; private salt <pb id="p.31" n="31"/>works are broken up; the introduction of medicines is forbidden; means of subsistence are wantonly wasted to produce beggary; prisoners are returned with contagious diseases; the last morsel of food has been taken from families, who were not allowed to carry on a trade or branch of industry; a rigid and offensive <hi rend="italics">espionage</hi> has been introduced to ferret out <quote>disloyalty;</quote> persons have been forced to choose between starvation of helpless children and taking the oath of allegiance to a hated government; the cartel for exchange of prisoners has been suspended and our unfortunate soldiers subjected to the grossest indignities; the wounded at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> were deprived of their nurses and inhumanly left to perish on the field; helpless women have been exposed to the most cruel outrages and to that dishonor which is infinitely worse than death; citizens have been murdered by the <name>Butlers</name> and McNeils and Milroys, who are favorite generals of our enemies; refined and delicate ladies have been seized, bound with cords, imprisoned, guarded by negroes, and held as hostages for the return of recaptured slaves; unoffending non-combatants have been banished or dragged from their quiet homes, to be immured in filthy jails; preaching the gospel has been refused, except on condition of taking the oath of allegiance; parents have been forbidden to name their children in honor of <quote>rebel</quote> chiefs; property has been confiscated; <rs type="role" reg="military-Governor">military governors</rs> have been appointed for States, satraps for provinces, and Haynaus for cities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>These cruelties and atrocities of the enemy have been exceeded by their malicious and blood-thirsty purposes and machinations in reference to the slaves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The following is the paper referred to in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> resolution,. being the general outline for the original organization of the society,, as modified by the convention: <pb id="p.41" n="41"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName> is organized with the following general outline:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>A parent society, to hold its seat and its archives in the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Virginia</placeName>, with affiliated societies to be organized in all the <name>States</name> favorable to the object proposed; these in their turn branching into local organizations in the different townships &mdash; forming thus a wide fellowship of closely co-ordinated societies, with a common centre in the parent association in the said city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>The object proposed to be accomplished is the collection, classification preservation, and final publication, in some form to be hereafter determined, of all the documents and facts bearing upon the eventful history of the past few years, illustrating the nature of the struggle from which the country has just emerged, defining and vindicating the principles which lay beneath it, and marking the stages through which it was conducted to its issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>It is not understood that this association shall be purely sectional, nor that its labors shall be of a partisan character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Everything which relates to this critical period of our national history, pending the conflict, antecedent or subsequent to it, from the point of view of either, or of both the contestants; everything, in short, which shall vindicate the truth of history is to be industriously collated and filed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>It is doubtless true, that an accepted history can never be written in the midst of the stormy events of which that history is composed, nor by the agents through whose efficiency they were wrought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>The strong passions which are evoked in every human conflict disturb the vision and warp the judgment, in the scales of whose criticism the necessary facts are to be weighed &mdash; even the relative importance of these facts cannot be measured by those who are in too close proximity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Scope must be afforded for the development of the remote issues before they can be brought under the range of a philosophical apprehension; and the secret thread be discovered, running through all history, upon which its single facts crystalize in the unity of some great Providential plan.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The generations of the disinterested must succeed the generations of the prejudiced before history, properly termed such, can be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>This, precisely, is the work we now attempt, to construct the archives in which shall be collected these memoirs to serve for future history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>It is believed that invaluable documents are scattered over the whole land, in loose sheets, perhaps lying in the portfolios of private gentlemen, and only preserved as souvenirs of their own parts in the historic drama.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Existing in forms so perishable, regarded, it may be, only as so much waste paper, by those into whose hands they must fall, no delay should be suffered in their collection and preservation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>There is doubtless, too much that is yet unwritten floating only in the memories of the living, which if not speedily rescued will be swallowed in the oblivion of the grave, but which, if reduced to <pb id="p.42" n="42"/>record and collated, would afford the key to many a cypher, in a little while to become unintelligible for want of interpretation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>All this various material, gathered from every section, will need to be industriously classified and arranged, and finally deposited in the central archives of the society, under the care of appropriate guardians.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>To this task of collection, we invite the immediate attention and co-operation of our copatriots throughout the <rs>South</rs>, to facilitate which, we propose the organization of State and district associations, that our whole people may be brought in harmony of action in this important matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>The rapid changes through which the institutions of the country are now passing, and the still more stupendous revolutions in the opinions of men, remind us that we stand to-day upon the outer verge of a great historic cycle, within which a completed past will shortly be enclosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Another cycle may touch its circumference; but the events it shall embrace will be gathered around another historic centre, and the future historian will pronounce that in stepping from the <num value="1">one</num> to the other he has entered upon another and separate volume of the nation's record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Let us, who are soon to be in that past to which we properly belong, see there are no gaps in the record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Thus shall we discharge a duty to the fathers, whose principles we inherit, to the children, who will then know whether to honor or to dishonor the sires that begot them; and above all, to the dead heroes sleeping on the vast battle plains, from the <rs>Susquehannah</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, whose epitaph history yet waits to engrave upon their tombs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>The funds raised by initiation fees, assessments, donations and lectures, after defraying the current expenses, will be appropriated to the safe keeping of the archives, and publication of the transactions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>For the accomplishment of these ends contributions are respectfully solicited from all parties interested in the establishment and prosperity of the <orgName n="Southern Historical Society" type="society">Southern Historical Society</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>This many of them did, and the <rs>North</rs> got rid of her slaves, not so much by emancipation or any sympathy for the blacks as by sale, and in consequence of her greed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The <rs>North</rs> opposed it, on the ground that slavery existed there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The South appealed to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, called for the charter which created the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and asked for the clause which gave Congress the power to interfere with the domestic institutions of any State, or with any of her affairs, further than to see that her organic law insured a republican form of Government to her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Nay, she appealed to the force of treaty obligations; and reminded the <rs>North</rs> that in the treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> for the acquisition of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, of which <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> was a part, the public faith was pledged to protect the <rs>French</rs> settlers there, and their descendants, in their rights of property, which includes slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>The public mind became excited, sectional feelings ran high, and the <rs>Union</rs> was in danger of being broken up through Northern aggression and Congressional usurpations at that early day. To quiet the storm, a son of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> came forward as peace-maker, and carried through Congress a bill that is known as <quote><placeName reg="The Missouri">The Missouri</placeName> compromise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>So the danger was averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>This bill, however, was a concession, simple and pure, to the <rs>North</rs> on the part of the <rs>South</rs>, with no equivalent whatever, except the gratification of a patriotic desire to live in harmony with her sister States and preserve the <pb id="p.53" n="53"/>Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>This compromise was to the effect that the <rs>Southern</rs> people should thereafter waive their right to go with their slaves into any part of the common territory north of the parellel of <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime;.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>That posterity may fairly appreciate the extent of this exaction by the <rs>North</rs>, with the sacrifice made by the <rs>South</rs> to satisfy it, maintain the public faith and preserve the <rs>Union</rs>, it is necessary to refer to a map of the country, and to remember that at that time neither <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>, <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> nor <placeName reg="Arizona" key="tgn,7006451">Arizona</placeName> belonged to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; that the country west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> which fell under that compromise is that which was acquired from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in the purchase of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, and which includes <hi rend="italics">West</hi> <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>, the whole of <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, the <placeName reg="Oklahoma" key="tgn,7007707">Indian Territory</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7007713;tgn,7007705" n="0.089 000000.8865	placename;tgn,7007713;name,United States,North and Central America;0.089 000000.8865	placename;tgn,7007705;name,United States,North and Central America" reg="name,United States,North and Central America;name,United States,North and Central America">Dakota</placeName>, <placeName reg="Montana" key="tgn,7007524">Montana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wyoming" key="tgn,7007923">Wyoming</placeName>, <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Colorado</placeName>, <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>, <placeName reg="Nevada" key="tgn,7007526">Nevada</placeName>, <placeName reg="Idaho" key="tgn,7007250">Idaho</placeName>, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, embracing an area of <num value="1360000">1,360,000</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The sacrifice thus made by the <rs>South</rs>, for the sake of the <rs>Union</rs>, will be more fully appreciated when we reflect that under the <rs>Constitution Southern</rs> gentlemen had as much right, and the same right to go into the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> with their slaves, that the men of the <rs>North</rs> had to carry with them there their apprentices and servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Though this arrangement was so prejudicial to the <rs>South</rs>, though the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> decided it to be unconstitutional, null and void, the <rs>Southern</rs> people were still willing to stand by it; but the <rs>North</rs> would not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Furthermore, the magnificent country given by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to the <rs>Union</rs> came to be managed in the political interests of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Such was the rush of settlers from abroad to the polar side of <num value="36">36</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&Prime; and for the cheap and rich lands of the northwest territory, that the population of the <rs>North</rs> was rapidly and vastly increased &mdash; so vastly that when the war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> commenced, the immigrants and the decendants of immigrants which the <num value="2">two</num> sections had received from the Old World since this <pb id="p.54" n="54"/>grant was made, amounted to not less than <num value="7000000">7,000,000</num> souls more for the <rs>North</rs> than for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>This increase destroyed the balance of power between the sections in Congress, placed the <rs>South</rs> hopelessly in the minority, and gave the reins of the <rs>Government</rs> over into the hands of the <rs>Northern</rs> factions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Thus the <num value="270000000">two hundred and seventy millions</num> of acres of the finest land on the continent which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> gave to the <rs>Government</rs> to hold in trust as a <hi rend="italics">common</hi> fund, was so managed as greatly to benefit <num value="1">one</num> section and do the other harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Nor was this all.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>In consequence of the <name>Berlin</name> and Milan Decrees, the <name>Orders</name> in Council, the <name>Embargo</name> and the war which followed in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, the people of the whole country suffered greatly for the want of manufactured articles, many of which bad become necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Moreover, it was at that time against the laws of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for any artisan or piece of machinery used in her workshops to be sent to this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Under these circumstances it was thought wise to encourage manufacturing in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, until American labor could be educated for it, and the requisite skill acquired, and Southern statesmen took the lead in the passage of a tariff to encourage and protect our manufacturing industries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>But in course of time these restrictive laws in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were repealed, and it then became easier to import than to educate labor and skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Nevertheless the protection continued, and was so effectual that the manufacturers of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> began to compete in foreign markets with the manufacturers of Old England.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Whereupon the <rs>South</rs> said, <quote>Enough: the <rs>North</rs> has free trade with us; the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic ocean</placeName> rolls between this country and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; the expense of freight and transportation across it, with moderate duties for <hi rend="italics">revenue</hi> alone, ought to be protection enough for these Northern industries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Therefore let us do way with tariffs for <hi rend="italics">protection</hi>. They have not, by reason of geographical law, turned a wheel in the <rs>South</rs>; moreover, they have proved a greivous burden to our people.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Northern statesmen did not see the case in that light; but fairness, right and the <rs>Constitution</rs> were on the side of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>She pointed to the unfair distribution of the public lands, the unequal dispensation among the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Government</rs> favor and patronage, and to the fact that the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> manufacturers had gained a <pb id="p.55" n="55"/>firm footing and were flourishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Moreover, peace, progress and development had, since the end of the <rs>French</rs> wars, dictated free trade as the true policy of all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Our <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> proceeded to demonstrate by example the hardships of submitting any longer to tariffs for protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The example was to this effect:--The <orgName n="Northern Farmer" type="newspaper">Northern farmer</orgName> clips his <measure n="100barrels" type="mass">hundred bales</measure> of wool, and the <rs>Southern</rs> planter picks his <measure n="100barrels" type="mass">hundred bales</measure> of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>So far they are equal, for the <rs>Government</rs> affords to each equal protection in person and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>That's fair, and there is no complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>But the <rs>Government</rs> would not stop here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>It went further &mdash; protected this industry of <num value="1">one</num> section and taxed that of the other; for though it suited the farmer's interest and convenience to send his wool to a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> mill to have it made into cloth, it also suited in a like degree the <rs>Southern</rs> planter to send his cotton to Old England to have it made into calico.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>And now came the injustice and the grievance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>They both prefer the <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> market, and they both, the illustration assumed, arrived by sea the same day and proceeded together, each with his invoice of <measure n="100barrels" type="mass">one hundred bales</measure>, to the custom-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>There the <rs>Northern</rs> man is told that he may land his <measure n="100barrels" type="mass">one hundred bales</measure> duty free; but the <rs>Southern</rs> man is required to leave <num value="40">forty</num> of his in the custom-house for the privilege of landing the remaining <num value="60">sixty</num>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/> 
<p>The tariff at that time was <num value="0.4">forty per cent.</num></p></note> It was in vain for the <rs>Southerner</rs> to protest or to urge, <quote>You make us pay bounties to Northern fishermen under the plea that it is a nursery for seamen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Is not the fetching and carrying of Southern cotton across the sea in Southern ships as much a nursery for seaman as the catching of codfish in <name>Yankee</name> smacks?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>But instead of allowing us a bounty for this, you exact taxes and require protection for our Northern fellow-citizens at the expense of Southern industry and enterprise.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The complaints against the tariff were, at the end of <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure>, followed by another compromise in the shape of a modified tariff, by which the <rs>South</rs> again gained nothing and the <rs>North</rs> everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The effect was simply to <hi rend="italics">lessen</hi>, not to abolish, the tribute money exacted for the benefit of Northern industries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/><measure n="15years" type="date">Fifteen years</measure> before the war it was stated officially from the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, that under the tariff then in force the self-sustaining industry of the country was taxed in this indirect way in the sum of <measure n="80000000dollars" type="currency">$80,000,000</measure> annually, none of which went into the coffers of the <rs>Government</rs>, but all into the pocket of the protected manufacturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The South, moreover, complained of <pb id="p.56" n="56"/>the unequal distribution of the public expenditures; of unfairness in protecting, buoying, lighting and surveying the coasts, and laid her complaints on grounds like these: for every mile of sea-front in the <rs>North</rs> there are <num value="4">four</num> in the <rs>South</rs>, yet there were <num value="4">four</num> well-equipped dockyards in the <rs>North</rs> to <num value="1">one</num> in the <rs>South</rs>; large sums of money had been expended for Northern, small for Southern defences; navigation of the <rs>Southern</rs> coast was far more difficult and dangerous than that of the <rs>Northern</rs>, yet the latter was better lighted; and the <rs>Southern</rs> coast was not surveyed by the <rs>Government</rs> until it had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> furnished Northern ship-owners with good charts for navigating their waters and entering their harbors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Thus dealt by, there was cumulative dissatisfaction in the <rs>Southern</rs> mind towards the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and Southern men began to ask each other, <quote>Should we not be better off out of the <rs>Union</rs> than we are in it?</quote> --nay, the public discontent rose to such a pitch in consequence of the tariff, that nullification was threatened, and the existence of the <rs>Union</rs> was again seriously imperilled, and dissolution might have ensued had not <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> stepped in with her wise counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>She poured oil upon the festering sores in the <rs>Southern</rs> mind, and did what she could in the interests of peace; but the wound could not be entirely healed; Northern archers had hit too deep.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The Washington Government was fast drifting towards centralization, and the result of all this Federal partiality, of this unequal protection and encouragement, was that <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs> flourished and prospered as no people have ever done in modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Scenes enacted in the Old World, <measure n="2800years" type="date">twenty-eight hundred years</measure> ago, seemed now on the eve of repetition in the new.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>By the <rs>Constitution</rs>, a citizen of the <rs>South</rs> had a right to pursue his fugitive slave into any of the <name>States</name>, apprehend and bring him back; but so unfriendly had the <rs>North</rs> become towards the <rs>South</rs>, and so regardless of her duties under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, that Southern citizens, in pursuing and attempting to apprehend runaway negroes in the <rs>North</rs>, were thrown into jail, maltreated and insulted despite of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Northern people loaded the mails for the <rs>South</rs> with inflammatory publications inciting the negroes to revolt, and encouraging them to rise up, in servile insurrection, and murder their owners.

This grated upon the generous feelings of our people the more, because they were thus compelled in self-defence to spread hateful laws upon the statute-book of their State, and subject her fair fame to invidious criticisms by posterity, and this in consequence of the repeated attempt of the <rs>Northern</rs> people to tamper with the negroes and interfere with our domestic affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>It was a shaft which sank deep and rankled long; it brought to mind colonial times, and put into Southern heads the idea of another separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>But this was not all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>Finally, the aggressive and fanatical spirit of the <rs>North</rs> ran to such a pitch against us, that just before the <rs>Southern</rs> people began to feel that patience and forbearance were both exhausted, a band of raiders, fitted out and equipped in the <rs>North</rs>, came down upon <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> with sword and spear in hand.

The South warned the <rs>North</rs> and protested, the political leaders in some of the <rs>Southern States</rs> publicly declaring that if <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0007.00059.00268" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, their nominee, were elected, the <name>States</name> would not remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>He was truly a sectional candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>He received no vote in the <rs>South</rs>, but was, under the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, duly elected nevertheless; for now the poll of the <rs>North</rs> was large enough to elect whom she pleased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>When the result of this election was anounced, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States each proceeded to call a convention of her people; and they, in the exercise of their <hi rend="italics">inalienable right</hi> to alter and abolish the form of government and to institute a new <num value="1">one</num>, resolved to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> <hi rend="italics">peaceably</hi>, if they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>They felt themselves clear as to their right, and thrice-armed; for they remembered that they were sovereign people, and called to mind those precious rights that had been solemnly proclaimed, and in which and for which we and our fathers before us had the most abiding faith, reverence and belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Prominent among these was, <pb id="p.60" n="60"/>as we have seen, the right of each <num value="1">one</num> of these States to consult her own welfare and withdraw or remain in the <rs>Union</rs> in obedience to its dictates and the judgment of her own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>So they sent commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to propose a settlement, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> offering to assume their quota of the debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and asking for their share of the common property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>This was refused.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>In the meantime <rs>Virginia</rs> assembled her people in <orgName n="Grand Council" type="council">grand council</orgName> too; but she refused to come near the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in their councils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/><hi rend="italics">She</hi> had laid the corner-stone of the <rs>Union</rs>, <hi rend="italics">her</hi> sons were its chief architects; and though she felt that she and her sister States had been wronged without cause, and had reason, good and sufficient, for withdrawing from a political association which no longer afforded domestic tranquility, or promoted the general welfare, or answered its purposes, yet her love for the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs> was strong, and the idea of pulling down, without having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> exhausted all her persuasives, and tried all means to save what had cost her so much, was intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>She thought the time for separation had not come, and waited <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to try her own <quote>mode and measure of redress</quote> ; she considered that it should not be such as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Moreover, by standing firm she hoped to heal the breach, as she had done on several occasions before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>She asked all the <name>States</name> to meet her in a <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">peace congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>They did so, and the <rs>North</rs> being largely in the majority, threw out Southern propositions and rejected all the efforts of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> at conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> all remained in the <rs>Union</rs>, awaiting the action of our State, who urged the <rs>Washington Government</rs> not to attempt to coerce the seceded States, or force them with sword and bayonet back into the <rs>Union</rs>--a thing, she held, which the charter that created the <rs>Government</rs> gave it no authority to do.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Regardless of these wise counsels and of all her rightful powers, the <rs>North</rs> mustered an army to come against the <rs>South</rs>; whereupon, seeing the time had come, and claiming the right which she had especially reserved not only for herself, but for all the <name>States</name>, to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, the grand old Commonwealth did not hesitate to use it. She prepared to meet the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Her people had already been assembled in convention, and they, in the persons of their representatives, passed the ordinance of secession, which separated her from the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and left her alone, again a free, sovereign and independent State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>This <pb id="p.61" n="61"/>done, she sounded the notes of warlike preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>She called upon her sons who were in the service of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> to confess their allegiance to her, resign their places, and rally around her standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The true men among them came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>In a few days she had an army of <num value="60000">60,000</num> men in the field; but her policy was still peace, armed peace, not war. Assuming the attitude of defence, she said to the powers of the <rs>North</rs>, <quote>Let no hostile foot cross my borders.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Nevertheless they came with fire and sword; battle was joined; victory crowned her banners on many a well-fought field; but she and her sister States, cut off from the outside world by the navy which they had helped to establish for the common defence, battled together against fearful odds at home for <num value="4">four</num> long years, but were at last overpowered by mere numbers, and then came disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Her sons who fell died in defence of their country, their homes, their rights, and all that makes native land dear to the hearts of men. <milestone unit="hr"/> </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>It is a vivid picture of camp life, which will be readily recognized by the old soldier,. and contains matter well worthy of a place in these papers.]</p></quote> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>The soldier may forget the long, weary march, with its dust, heat and thirst, and he may forget the horrors and blood of the battle-field, or he may recall them sadly, as <num value="1">one</num> thinks of the loved dead; but the cheerful, happy scenes of the camp fire he will never forget!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>How willingly he closes his eyes to the present to dream of those happy, careless days and nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Around the fire crystallize the memories of the soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>It was his home &mdash; his place of rest, where he met with good companionship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/><hi rend="italics">Who kindled the fire</hi>? Nobody had matches, there was no fire in sight, and yet, scarcely <pb id="p.77" n="77"/>was the camp determined when the bright blaze of the camp-fire was seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/><hi rend="italics">He</hi> was a shadowy fellow who kindled the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>Nobody knows who he was, but no matter how wet the leaves, how sobby the twigs &mdash; no matter if there was no fire in a mile of the camp, that fellow could start <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Some men might get down on hands and knees, and blow it and fan it, rear and charge, and fume and fret, and yet <quote>she wouldn't burn.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>But this fellow would come, kick it all around, scatter it, rake it together again, shake it up a little, and oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/><hi rend="italics">how</hi> it burned The little flames would bite the twigs, and snap at the branches, embrace the logs, and leap and dance, and laugh at the touch of the master's hand and soon lay at his feet a bed of glowing coals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>As soon as the fire is kindled all hands want water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Who can find it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Where is it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Never mind I we have a man who knows where to go. He says, <quote>where's our bucket?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/>and then we hear the rattle of the old tin cup as it drops to the bottom of it, and away he goes, nobody knows where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>But <hi rend="italics">he</hi> knows, and he doesn't stop to think, but without the slightest hesitation or doubt, strikes out in the darkness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>From the camp-fire as a centre, draw <num value="500">500</num> radii, and start an ordinary man on any of them, and let him walk a mile on each, and he will miss the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>But that fellow in the mess with the water instinct never failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>He would go as staight for the spring, or well, or creek, or river, as though he had lived in that immediate neighborhood all his life and never got water anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>What a valuable man he was. A modest fellow, who never knew his own greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>But others remember and honor him. May he never want for any good thing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>Having a roaring fire and a bucket of good water, we settle down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>A man cannot be comfortable <quote><hi rend="italics">anywhere;</hi></quote> so each man and his <quote>chum</quote> picks out a tree, and that particular tree becomes the homestead of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>They hang their canteens on it, lay their haversacks and spread their blankets at the foot of it, and sit down, and lean their weary backs against it, and feel that they are at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>How gloomy the woods are beyond the glow of our fire?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>How cosy and comfortable we are who stand around it and inhale the aroma of the coffee boiler and the skillet?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>The man squatting by the fire is a person of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>He doesn't talk &mdash; not he; his whole mind is concentrated on that skillet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>He is our cook &mdash; volunteer, natural and talented cook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>Not in a vulgar sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>He doesn't mix, but simply bakes, the biscuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>Every faculty, all the energy of the man, is employed in that great work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Don't suggest <pb id="p.78" n="78"/>anything to him if you value his friendship!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>Don't attempt to put on or take off from the top of that skillet <num value="1">one</num> single coal, and don't be in a hurry for the biscuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>You need not say you <quote>like yours half done,</quote> &amp;c. Simply wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>When he thinks they are ready, and not before, you get them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/><hi rend="italics">He</hi> may raise the lid cautiously now and then and look in, but don't <hi rend="italics">you</hi> look in. Don't say you think they are done; because it's useless.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Ah! his face relaxes &mdash; he raises the lid, turns it upside down to throw off the coals, and says: <hi rend="italics">All right boys</hi>! And now with the air of a wealthy philanthropist he distributes the solid and weighty product of his skill to, as it were, the humble dependents around him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>The <quote>General</quote> of the mess having satisfied the cravings of the inner-man, now proceeds to enlighten the ordinary members of it as to when, how and why, and where the campaign will open, and what will be the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>He arranges for every possible and impossible contingency, and brings the war to a favorable and early termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>The greatest mistake <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0001.0009.00078.00590" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:20"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> ever made, was that he failed to consult this man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The <quote>Boys in blue</quote> generally preferred to camp in the open fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>The Confed's took to the woods, and so the <rs>Confederate</rs> camp was not as orderly or as systematically arranged, but the most picturesque of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>The blazing fire lit up the forms and faces and trees around it with a ruddy glow, but only deepened the gloom of the surrounding woods, so that the soldier pitied the poor fellows away off on guard in the darkness, and hugged himself and felt how good it was to be with the fellows around the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>How companionable was the blaze and the glow of the coals!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>They seemed to warm the heart as well as the foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>The imagination seemed to feed on the glowing coals and surrounding gloom, and when the soldier gazed on the fire, peace, liberty, home, strolls in the woods and streets with friends, the church, the school, playmates and sweethearts all passed before him, and even the dead came to mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>Sadly, yet pleasantly, he thought of the loved and lost, and the future loomed up, and the possibility of death and prison and the grief at home would stir his heart, and the tears would fall trickling to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>Then was the time to fondle the little gifts from home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>Simple things &mdash; the little pincushion, the needlecase with thread and buttons, the embroidered tobacco bag, and the knitted gloves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Then the time to gaze on photographs, and to read and re-read the letter telling of the struggles at home and the coming box of good things &mdash; butter and bread, and toasted and ground <pb id="p.83" n="83"/>coffee, and sugar cakes and pies, and other comfortable things saved by self-denial for the soldier, brother and son. Then the time to call on <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to spare, protect and bless the dear, defenceless, help-less ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Then the time for high resolves; to read to himself his duty; to <quote>re-enlist for the war.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>Then his heart grew to his comrades, his general and his country; and as the trees, swept by the wintry winds, moaned around him, the soldier slept and dreamed, and dreamed of home, sweet home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>Those whose knowledge of war and its effects on the character of the soldier was gleaned from the history of the wars of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and of ancient times, greatly dreaded the demoralization which they supposed would result from the <rs>Confederate</rs> war for independence, and their solicitude was directed mainly towards the young men of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs> who were to compose the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>It was feared by many that the bivouac, the camp fires and the march would accustom the ears of their bright and innocent boys to obscenity, oaths and blasphemy, and forever destroy that purity of mind and soul which was their priceless possession when they bid farewell to home and mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>Some feared the destruction of the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>The wiser feared hardship and disease; and others, more than all, the destruction of morals and everything good and pure in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>That the fears of the last named were realized in some cases cannot be denied; but that the general result was demoralization can be denied, and the contrary demonstrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>Let us consider the effect of camp life upon a pure and noble boy; and to make the picture complete, let us go to his home and witness the parting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>The boy is clothed as a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>His pockets and his haversack are stored with little conveniences made by the loving hands of mother, sister and sweetheart, and the sad yet proud hour has arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>Sisters, smiling through their tears, filled with commingled pride and sorrow, kiss and embrace their great hero.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>The mother, with calm heroism suppressing her tender maternal grief, impresses upon his lips a fervent, never-to-be-forgotten kiss, presses him to her heart, and resigns him to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, his country and his honor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The father, last to part, presses his hand, gazes with ineffable love into his bright eyes, and fearing to trust his feelings for a more lengthy farewell, says, <quote>Good bye, my boy; <name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you, be a man!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/><pb id="p.84" n="84"/></p> 
<p>Let those scoff who will; but let them know that such a parting is itself a new and wonderful power, a soul-enlarging, purifying and elevating power, worth the danger, toil and suffering of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>The sister's tears, the father's words, the mother's kiss, planted in the memory of that boy will surely bring forth fruit beautiful as a mother's love.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>As he journeys to the camp, how dear do all at home become!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>Oh! what holy tears he sheds!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>His heart, how tender!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>Then, as he nears the line, and sees for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the realities of war, the passing sick and weary, and the wounded and bloody dead, his soldier spirit is born; he smiles, his chest expands, his eyes brighten, his heart swells with pride; he hurries on, and soon stands in the magic circle around the glowing fire, the admired and loved pet of a dozen true hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>Is he happy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Aye! Never before has he felt such glorious, swelling, panting joy. He's a soldier now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>He is put on guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>No longer the object of care and solicitude, he stands in the solitude of the night, himself a guardian of those who sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>Courage is his now. He feels he is trusted as a man, and is ready at once nobly to perish in the defence of his comrades.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>He marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>Dare he murmur or complain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>No; the eyes of all are upon him, and endurance grows silently, till pain and weariness are familiar, and cheerfully borne.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>At home he would be pitied and petted; but now he must endure, or have the contempt of the strong spirits around him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>He is hungry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>So are others; and he must not only bear the privation, but he must divide his pitiful meal when he gets it with his comrades; and so generosity strikes down selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>In a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ways he is tried, and that by sharp critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>His smallest faults are necessarily apparent, for, in the varying conditions of the soldier, every quality is put to the test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>If he shows the least cowardice he is undone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>His courage must never fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>He must be manly and independent, or he will be told he's a baby, ridiculed, teased and despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>When war assumes her serious dress, he sees the helplessness of women and children, he hears their piteous appeals, and chivalry burns him till he does his utmost of sacrifice and effort to protect and comfort and cheer them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>It is a mistake to suppose that the older men in the army encouraged vulgarity and obscenity in the young recruit; for even those who themselves indulged in these would frown on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> show of them in a boy, and without hesitation put him down mercilessly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>No parent could watch a boy as closely as his mess-mates <pb id="p.85" n="85"/>did and could, because they saw him at all hours of the day and night, dependent on himself alone: and were merciless critics, who demanded more of their protege than they were willing to submit to themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>The young soldier's piety had to perish ignominiously, or else assume a boldness and strength which nothing else could so well impart as the temptations, sneers and dangers of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Religion had to be bold, practical and courageous, or die.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>In the army the young man learned to value men for what they were, and not on account of education, wealth or station; and so his attachments when formed were sincere and durable, and he learned what constitutes a man, and a desirable and reliable friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>The stern demands upon the boy, and the unrelenting criticisms of the mess, soon bring to mind the gentle forbearance, and kind remonstrance, and loving counsels of parents and homefolks, and while he thinks, he weeps, and loves, and reverences, and yearns after the things against which he once strove and under which he chafed and complained.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>Home, father, mother, sister &mdash; oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>how far away; oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>how dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>Himself how contemptible I ever to have felt cold and indifferent to such love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>Then, how vividly he recalls the warm pressure of his mother's lips on the forehead of her boy. How he loves his mother!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>See him as he fills his pipe from the silk embroidered bag. There is his name embroidered carefully, beautifully by his sister's hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Does he forget her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>Does he not now love her more sincerely and truly and tenderly than ever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>Could he love her quite as much had he never parted, never longed to see her and could not; never been uncertain if she was safe, never felt she might be homeless, helpless, insulted, a refugee from home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Can he ever now look on a little girl and not treat her kindly, gently and lovingly &mdash; remembering his sister?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>A boy having ordinary natural goodness, and the home supports described, and the constant watching of men, ready to criticise, could but improve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>The least exhibition of selfishness, cowardice, vulgarity, dishonesty, or meanness of any kind, brought down the dislike of every man upon him, and persistence in <hi rend="italics">any <num value="1">one</num></hi> disreputable practice, or habitual laziness and worthlessness, resulted in complete ostracism, loneliness and misery; while on the other hand he might, by good behavior and genuine generosity and courage, secure unbounded love and sincere respect from all. Visits home, after prolonged <pb id="p.86" n="86"/>absence and danger, open to the young soldier new treasures &mdash; new, because, though possessed always, never before felt and realized.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>The affection once seen only in every day attention, as he reaches home, breaks out in unrestrained vehemence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>The warm embrace of the hitherto dignified father, the ecstatic pleasure beaming in the mother's eye, the proud welcome of the sister, and the wild enthusiasm even of the old black mammy, crowd on him the knowledge of their love and make him braver, and stronger, and nobler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>He's a hero from that hour!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>Death for these &mdash; how easy!! The dangers of the battle-field, and the demands upon his energy, strength and courage, not only strengthen, but almost create new faculties of mind and heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>The death, sudden and terrible, of those dear to him, and the imperative necessity of standing to his duty while the wounded cry and groan, and while his heart yearns after them to help them, and the terrible thirst, and hunger, and heat, and weariness &mdash; all these teach a boy self-denial, attachment to duty, and the value of peace and safety; and instead of hardening him, as some suppose they do, make him to pity and love even the enemy of his country who bleeds and dies for <hi rend="italics">his</hi> country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>The acquirement of subordination certainly is a useful <num value="1">one</num>, and that the soldier perforce has. And that not in an abject, cringing way, but as realizing the necessity of it, and seeing the result of it in the good order and consequent effectiveness and success of the army as a whole, but more particularly of his own company and detachment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>And if the soldier rises to office, the responsibility of command, attention to detail and minutiae, the critical eyes of his subordinates, and the demands of his superiors, all withdraw him from the enticements of vice, and mould him into a.solid, substantial character, both capable and willing to meet and overcome difficulties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>The effect of outdoor life on the physical constitution is undoubtedly good, and as the physical improves, the mental is improved; and as the mind is enlightened, the spirit is enabled to grasp the purifying truths of the gospel, and thus the whole man is benefited.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>Who can calculate the benefit derived from the contemplation of the beautiful in nature, as the soldier sees?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Mountains and valleys, dreary wastes and verdant fields, rivers, sequestered homes, stirred by the sounds of war; quiet, sleepy villages, as they lay in the morning light, doomed to the flames at evening: this enlarges the <pb id="p.87" n="87"/>mind, and stores it with a panorama whose pictures he may pass before his mental vision with quiet pleasure year after year for a lifetime.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>War <hi rend="italics">is</hi> horrible, but still it is in a sense a privilege to have lived in time of war. The emotions are never so stirred as then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>Imagination takes her highest flights, poetry blazes, song stirs the soul, and every noble attribute is brought into full play.</p>

The camp fires of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> were not places of revelry and debauchery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>They often exhibited gentle scenes of love and humanity, and the purest sentiments and gentlest feelings of man were there admired and loved, while vice and debauch, in any, from highest to lowest, were condemned and punished more severely than they are among those who stay at home and shirk the dangers and toils of the soldier's life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>Indeed, the demoralizing effects of the late war were far more visible <quote>at home</quote> among the skulks, and bombproofs, and suddenly diseased, than in the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>And the demoralized men of to-day are not those who served in the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>The defaulters, the renegades, the bummers and cheats, are the boys who enjoyed fat places and salaries and easy comfort &mdash; while the solid, respected and reliable men of the community are those who did their duty as soldiers, and having learned to suffer in war have preferred to labor and suffer and earn rather than steal &mdash; in peace.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>And, strange to say, it is not those who suffered most and lost most, who fought and bled &mdash; who saw friend after friend fall, who wept the dead and buried their hopes &mdash; it is not these who now are bitter and dissatisfied, and quarrelsome and fretful, and growling and complaining &mdash; no, they are the peaceful, submissive, law-abiding and order-loving of the country, ready to join hands with all good men in every good work, and prove themselves as brave and good in peace as they were stubborn and unconquerable in war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>Many a weak, puny boy was returned to his parents a robust, healthy, <hi rend="italics">manly man</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>Men learned that life was passable and enjoyable without a roof or even a tent, to shelter from the storm &mdash; that cheerfulness was compatible with cold and hunger, and that a man without money, food or shelter, need not feel utterly hopeless, but might, by employing his wits, find something to eat where he never found it before; and feel that, like a terrapin, he might make himself at home wherever he might be.

We shall, therefore, devote the next number of our papers to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>We expect to be able to establish some such points as the following: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/><num value="1">1</num>. The Confederate authorities <hi rend="italics">always</hi> ordered the kind treatment of prisoners of war, and if there were individual cases of cruel treatment it was in violation of positive orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/><pb id="p.110" n="110"/></p> 
<p><num value="2">2</num>. The orders were to give prisoners the same rations that our own soldiers received, and if rations were scarce and of inferior quality, it was through no fault of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/><num value="3">3</num>. The prison hospitals were put on the same footing precisely as the hospitals for our own men, and if there was unusual suffering caused by want of medicine and hospital stores, it arose from the fact that the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities declared these <quote>contraband of war,</quote> and refused to accept the <rs>Confederate</rs> offer to allow Federal surgeons to come to the prisons with supplies of medicines and stores.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/><num value="4">4</num>. The prisons were established with reference to healthfulness of locality, and the great mortality among the prisoners arose from epidemics and chronic diseases, which our surgeons had not the means of preventing or arresting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>A strong proof of this will be given in an official statement which shows that nearly <hi rend="italics">as large a proportion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> guard at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> died as of the prisoners themselves</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/><num value="5">5</num>. The above reasons cannot be assigned for the cruel treatment which Confederates received in Northern prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>The order-books on that side are filled with vindictive orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>Though in a land flowing with plenty, our poor fellows in prison were famished with hunger, and would have considered <hi rend="italics">half</hi> the rations served Federal soldiers bountiful indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/>Their prison hospitals were very far from being on the same footing with the hospitals for their own soldiers, and our men died by <num value="1000">thousands</num> from causes which the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities <hi rend="italics">could</hi> have prevented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/><num value="6">6</num>. But the real cause of the suffering on both sides was the stoppage of the exchange of prisoners, and for this the <hi rend="italics">Federal authorities alone</hi> were responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>The Confederates kept the cartel in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1427"/>It was broken on the other side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1428"/>The Confederates were anxious to exchange man for man. It was the settled policy on the other side <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to exchange prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>The Confederates offered to exchange sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>This was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1431"/>In <dateStruct value="1864-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, we offered to send home all the <rs>Federal</rs> sick and wounded <hi rend="italics">without equivalent</hi>. The offer was not accepted until the following <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and it was during that period that the greatest mortality occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1432"/>The Federal authorities stood by and coldly suffered their soldiers in our prisons to die, in order that they might <quote>fire the <rs>Northern</rs> heart</quote> with stories of <quote>Rebel barbarities.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/><num value="7">7</num>. But the charge of cruelty made against the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders is triumphantly refuted by such facts as these: The official reports of <persName n="Stanton,Secretary,,,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00787" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,:7"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Barnes,Surgeon General,,,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00788" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName> show that a much larger per cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>of Confederates perished in Northern prisons than of Federals in Southern prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>And though the most persistent efforts were made to <hi rend="italics">get up a case</hi> against <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00789" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00790" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and others (even to the extent of offering poor <persName n="Wirz,,,,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00791" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,Henry,,,:5"><surname>Wirz</surname></persName> a reprieve if he would implicate them), they were not able to secure testimony upon which even <persName n="Holt,,,,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00792" reg="mostcommon:Holt,nomatch:0"><surname>Holt</surname></persName> and his military court dared to go into the trial.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>We have a large mass of documents on this subject, and the <rs>Secretary</rs> has been busy compiling them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>But it is earnestly requested that any of our friends who have facts and figures bearing on the question in any of its branches, which they are willing to give (or <hi rend="italics">lend</hi>) to the <name>Society</name>, will <hi rend="italics">at once</hi> forward them to the <rs>Secretary</rs>, <persName n="Jones,Reverend,J.,William,," id="n0001.0015.00110.00793" reg="expanded:Jones,John,William,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName></p>

<head>The question stated.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Let it be distinctly understood that we do not for a moment affirm that there was not a vast amount of suffering and fearful mortality among the <rs>Federal</rs> prisoners at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>But we are prepared to prove before any fair tribunal, from documents now in our archives, the following points:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/><num value="1">1</num>. The Confederate authorities <hi rend="italics">always</hi> ordered the kind treatment of prisoners of war, and if there were individual cases of cruel treatment it was in violation of positive orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/><num value="2">2</num>. The orders were to give prisoners the same rations that our own soldiers received, and if rations were scarce and of inferior quality it was through no fault of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/><num value="3">3</num>. The prison-hospitals were put on the same footing precisely as the hospitals for our own men, and if there was unusual suffering caused by want of medicine and hospital stores it arose from the fact that the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities declared these <quote>contraband of war,</quote> and refused to accept the <rs>Confederate</rs> offer to allow Federal surgeons to come to the prisons with supplies of medicines and stores.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/><num value="4">4</num>. The prisons were established with reference to healthfulness of locality, and the great mortality among the prisoners arose from epidemics and chronic diseases which our surgeons had not the means of preventing or arresting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>A strong proof of this is the fact that nearly <hi rend="italics">as large a proportion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> guard at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.091 000000.1818	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.1818	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> died as of the prisoners themselves</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/><num value="5">5</num>. The above reasons cannot be assigned for the cruel treatment which Confederates received in Northern prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>Though in a land flowing with plenty, our poor fellows in prison were famished with hunger, and would have considered <hi rend="italics">half</hi> the rations served Federal soldiers bountiful indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>Their prison-hospitals were very far from being on the same footing with the hospitals for their own soldiers, and our men died by <num value="1000">thousands</num> from causes which the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities <hi rend="italics">could</hi> have prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/><pb id="p.116" n="116"/></p> 
<p><num value="6">6</num>. But the real cause of the suffering on both sides was the stoppage of the exchange of prisoners, and for this the <hi rend="italics">Federal authorities alone</hi> were responsible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>The Confederates kept the cartel in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>It was broken on the other side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>The Confederates were anxious to exchange man for man. It was the settled policy on the other side <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to exchange prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>The Confederates offered to exchange sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>This was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>In <dateStruct value="1864-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, we offered to send home all the <rs>Federal</rs> sick and wounded <hi rend="italics">without equivalent</hi>. The offer was not accepted until the following <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and it was during that period that the greatest mortality occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>The Federal authorities determined as their war policy not to exchange prisoners, they invented every possible pretext to avoid it, and they at the same time sought to quiet the friends of their prisoners and to <quote>fire the <rs>Northern</rs> heart</quote> by most shamelessly charging that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> refused to exchange, and by industriously circulating the most malignant stories of <quote>Rebel barbarities</quote> to helpless veterans of the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/><num value="7">7</num>. But the charge of cruelty made against the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders is triumphantly refuted by such facts as these: The official reports of <persName n="Stanton,Secretary,,,," id="n0001.0017.00116.00829" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Barnes,Surgeon General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00116.00830" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon General">Surgeon General</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName> show that a much larger per cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>And though the most persistent efforts were made to <hi rend="italics">get up a case</hi> against <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0001.0017.00116.00831" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00116.00832" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and others (even to the extent of offering poor <persName n="Wirz,,,,," id="n0001.0017.00116.00833" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,Henry,,,:5"><surname>Wirz</surname></persName> a reprieve if he would implicate them), they were not able to secure testimony upon which even <persName n="Holt,,,,," id="n0001.0017.00116.00834" reg="mostcommon:Holt,nomatch:0"><surname>Holt</surname></persName> and his military court dared to go into the trial.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>What matters it to <num value="1">one</num> whose object is personal and party advantage that the records, both Federal and Confederate, disprove the charge; that the country is full of witnesses who bear oral testimony against it, and that the effort to revive the bitter animosities of the war obstructs the progress toward the reconciliation of the sections?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>Now let us review the leading facts of this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>The report of the <rs>Confederate</rs> commissioner for exchange of prisoners shows how persistent and liberal were our efforts to secure the relief of captives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>Failing in those attempts, I instructed <persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n0001.0017.00117.00845" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to go under flag of truce and seek an interview with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00117.00846" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, to represent to him the suffering and death of Federal prisoners held by us, to explain the causes which were beyond our control, and to urge in the name of humanity the observance of the cartel for the exchange of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>To this, as to all previous appeals, a deaf ear was turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>The interview was not granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>I will not attempt, from memory, to write the details of the correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0001.0017.00117.00847" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> no longer lives to defend the cause and country he loved so well and served so efficiently; but <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00117.00848" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> cannot fail to remember so extraordinary a proposition, and his objections to executing the cartel are well known to the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>But whoever else may choose to forget my efforts in this regard, the prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.109 000000.2182	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.109 000000.2182	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> and the delegates I permitted them to send to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0001.0017.00117.00849" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:4"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to plead for the resumption of exchange of prisoners cannot fail to remember how willing I was to restore them to their homes and to the comforts of which they were in need, provided the imprisoned soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> should be in like manner released and returned to us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>This foul accusation, though directed specially against me, was no doubt intended as, and naturally must be, the arraignment of the <rs>South</rs>, by whose authority and in whose behalf my deeds were done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>It may be presumed that the feelings and the habits of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers were understood by me, and in that connection <pb id="p.118" n="118"/>any fair mind would perceive in my congratulatory orders to the army after a victory, in which the troops were most commended for their tenderness and generosity to the wounded and other captives, as well the instincts of the person who issued the order as the knightly temper of the soldiers to whom it was addressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>It is admitted that the prisoners in our hands were not as well provided for as we would, but it is claimed that we did as well for them as we could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1523"/>Can the other side say as much?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1524"/>To the bold allegations of ill treatment of prisoners by our side, and humane treatment and adequate supplies by our opponents, it is only necessary to offer <num value="2">two</num> facts--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it appears from the reports of the <orgName n="U. S. War Department" type="org">United States War Department</orgName> that though we had <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> more Federal prisoners than they had of Confederates, <num value="6000">six thousand</num> more of Confederates died in Northern prisons than died of Federals in Southern prisons; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the want and suffering of men in Northern prisons caused me to ask for permission to send out cotton and buy supplies for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1525"/>The request was granted, but only on condition that the cotton should be sent to New York and the supplies be bought there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1526"/><persName n="Beale,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00118.00850" reg="mostcommon:Beale,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beale</surname></persName>, now of <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, was authorized to purchase and distribute the needful supplies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1527"/>Our sympathy rose with the occasion and responded to its demands &mdash; not waiting for <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, then to vaunt itself when it could serve no good purpose to the sufferers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1528"/>Under the mellowing influence of time and occasional demonstrations at the <rs>North</rs> of a desire for the restoration of peace and good will, the <rs>Southern</rs> people have forgotten much &mdash; have forgiven much of the wrongs they bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1529"/>If it be less so among their invaders, it is but another example of the rule that the wrong-doer is less able to forgive than he who has suffered causeless wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1530"/>It is not, however, generally among those who braved the hazards of battle that unrelenting vindictiveness is to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1531"/>The brave are generous and gentle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1532"/>It is the skulkers of the fight &mdash; the <name>Blaines</name> &mdash; who display their flags on an untented field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1533"/>They made no sacrifice to prevent the separation of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1534"/>Why should they be expected to promote the confidence and good will essential to their union?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1535"/>When closely confined at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> I was solicited to add my name to those of many esteemed gentlemen who had signed a petition for my pardon, and an assurance was given that on my doing so the <rs>President</rs> would order my liberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1536"/>Confident of the justice of our cause and the rectitude of my own conduct, I declined to sign the petition, and remained subject to the inexcusable privations and tortures which <persName n="Craven,Doctor,,,," id="n0001.0017.00118.00851" reg="mostcommon:Craven,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Craven</surname></persName> has but faintly described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1537"/>When, after <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of close confinement, I was admitted to bail, as often as required I appeared for trial under the indictment found against me, but in which <persName n="Blaine,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0017.00118.00852" reg="mostcommon:Blaine,James,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blaine</surname></persName>'s fictions do not appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1538"/>The indictment was finally quashed on no application of mine, nor have I ever evaded or avoided a trial upon any charge <pb id="p.119" n="119"/>the <rs>General Government</rs> might choose to bring against me, and have no view of the future which makes it desirable to me to be included in an amnesty bill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1539"/>Viewed in the abstract or as a general question, I would be glad to see the repeal of all laws inflicting the penalty of political disabilities on classes of the people that it might, as prescribed by the constitution, be left to the courts to hear and decide causes, and to affix penalties according to pre-existing legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1540"/>The discrimination made against our people is unjust and impolitic if the fact be equality and the purpose be fraternity among the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1541"/>Conviction and sentence without a hearing, without jurisdiction, and affixing penalties by <hi rend="italics">ex post facto</hi> legislation, are part of the proceeding which had its appropriate end in the assumption by Congress of the <rs>Executive</rs> function of granting pardons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1542"/>To remove political disabilities which there was not legal power to impose was not an act of so much grace as to form a plausible pretext for the reckless diatribe of <persName n="Blaine,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0017.00119.00853" reg="mostcommon:Blaine,James,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blaine</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1543"/>The papers preserved by <persName n="Stevenson,Doctor,,,," id="n0001.0017.00119.00854" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,R.,Randolph,,:6"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Stevenson</surname></persName> happily furnish full proof of the causes of disease and death at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.117 000000.2338	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.117 000000.2338	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1545"/>I have no taste for recrimination, though the sad recitals made by our soldiers returned from Northern prisons can never be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1546"/>And you will remember the excitement those produced, and the censorious publications which were uttered against me because I would not visit on the helpless prisoners in our hands such barbarities as, according to reports, had been inflicted upon our men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1547"/>Imprisonment is a hard lot at the best, and prisoners are prone to exaggerate their sufferings, and such was probably the case on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1548"/>But we did not seek by reports of committees, with photographic illustrations, to inflame the passions of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1549"/>How was it with our enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1550"/>Let <num value="1">one</num> example suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1551"/>You may remember a published report of a committee of the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName> which was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> to visit some exchanged prisoners, and which had appended to it the photographs of some emaciated subjects, which were offered as samples of prisoners returned from the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1552"/>When a copy of that report was received, I sent it to <persName n="Ould,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0017.00119.00855" reg="nearbymention:Ould,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, commissioner for the exchange of prisoners, and learned, as I anticipated, that the photographs, as far as they could be identified, had been taken from men who were in our hospital when they were liberated for exchange, and whom the hospital surgeon regarded as convalescent, but too weak to be removed with safety to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1553"/>The anxiety of the prisoners to be sent to their homes had prevailed over the objections of the surgeon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1554"/>But this is not all, for I have recently learned from a priest who was then at <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> that the most wretched looking of these photographs was taken from a man who had never been a prisoner, but who had been left on the <quote>sick list</quote> at <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> when the command <pb id="p.120" n="120"/>to which he was attached had passed that place on its southward march.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1555"/>Whatever may be said in extenuation of such imposture because of the exigencies of war, there can be no such excuse now for the attempts of <persName n="Blaine,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0017.00120.00856" reg="mostcommon:Blaine,James,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blaine</surname></persName>, by gross misrepresentation and slanderous accusation, to revive the worst passions of the war; and it is to be hoped that, much as the event is to be regretted, it will have the good effect of evoking truthful statements in regard to this little understood subject from men who would have preferred to leave their sorrowful story untold if the subject could have been allowed peacefully to sink into oblivion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1556"/>Mutual respect is needful for the common interest, is essential to a friendly union, and when slander is promulgated from high places the public welfare demands that truth should strip falsehood of its power for evil.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>Sufficient information has been officially published, I think, to show that whatever sufferings the <rs>Federal</rs> prisoners at the <rs>South</rs> underwent, were incident to their position as prisoners, and produced by the destitute condition of the country, arising from the operations of war. The laws of the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> and the orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> directed that the rations furnished prisoners of war should be the same in quantity and quality as those furnished enlisted men in the army of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and that the hospitals for prisoners should be placed on the same footing as other <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> hospitals in all respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>It was the desire of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to effect a continuous and speedy exchange of prisoners of war; for it was their true policy to do so, as their retention was not only a calamity to them, but a heavy expenditure of their scanty means of subsistence, and a privation of the services of a veteran army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>They were put in <num value="1">one</num> stockade for the want of men to guard more than <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>The section of country, moreover, was not regarded as more unhealthy, or more subject to malarious influences, than any in the central part of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>The official order for the erection of the stockade enjoined that it should be in <quote>a healthy locality, plenty of pure water, a running stream, and, if possible, shade trees, and in the immediate neighborhood of grist and saw mills.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>The very selection of the locality, :so far from being, as you suppose, made with cruel designs against the prisoners, was governed by the most humane considerations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>Your question might, with much more point, be retorted by asking, why were Southern prisoners taken in the dead of winter with their thin clothing to <placeName reg="Camp Douglas, Mineral, Nevada" key="tgn,2216708">Camp Douglas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rock Island, Rock Island, Illinois" key="tgn,7014353">Rock Island</placeName> and <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>-icy regions of the <rs>North</rs>--where it is a notorious fact that many of them actually froze to death?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/>As far as mortuary returns afford evidence of the general treatment of prisoners on both sides, the figures show nothing to the disadvantage of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, notwithstanding their limited supplies of all kinds, and notwithstanding all that has been said of the horrible sacrifice of life at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.130 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.130 000000.2603	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/>It now appears that a larger number of Confederates died in Northern than of Federals in Southern prisons or stockades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/>This report does not set forth the exact number of prisoners held by each side respectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/>These facts were given more in detail in a subsequent report by <persName n="Barnes,Surgeon General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00123.00878" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Surgeon General">Surgeon General</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>His report I have not seen, but according to a statement editorially, in the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName></hi>--very high authority &mdash; it appears from the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon General</rs>'s report, that the whole number of Federal prisoners captured by the <rs>Confederates</rs> and held in Southern prisons, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to <pb id="p.124" n="124"/>last during the war, was, in round numbers, <num value="270000">270,000</num>; while the whole number of Confederates captured and held in prisons by the <rs>Federals</rs> was, in like round numbers, only <num value="220000">220,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>From these <num value="2">two</num> reports it appears that, with <num value="50000">50,000</num> more prisoners in Southern stockades, or other modes of confinement, the deaths were nearly <num value="4000">4,000</num> less!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>According to these figures, the <hi rend="italics">per centum</hi> of Federal deaths in Southern prisons was <hi rend="italics">under <num value="9">nine</num></hi>! while the <hi rend="italics">per centum</hi> of Confederate deaths in Northern prisons was <hi rend="italics">over <num value="12">twelve</num></hi>! These mortality statistics are of no small weight in determining on which side was the most neglect, cruelty and inhumanity!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/>But the question in this matter is, <hi rend="italics">upon whom does this tremendous responsibility</hi> rest of all this sacrifice of human life, with all its indescribable miseries and sufferings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>The facts, beyond question or doubt, show that it rests <hi rend="italics">entirely</hi> upon the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>It is now well understood to have been a part of <hi rend="italics">their settled policy</hi> in conducting the war not to exchange prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>The grounds upon which this extraordinary course was adopted were that it was humanity to the men in the field, on their side, to let their captured comrades perish tin prison, rather than to let an equal number of Confederate soldiers be released on exchange to meet them in battle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>Upon the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, and upon them only, with this policy as their excuse, rests the whole of this responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/>To avert the indignation which the open avowal of this policy by them at the time would have excited throughout the <rs>North</rs>, and throughout the civilized world, the false cry of cruelty towards prisoners was raised against the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>This was but a pretext to cover their own violation of the usages of war in this respect among civilized nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>Other monstrous violations of like usages were not attempted to be palliated by them, or even covered by a pretext.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/>These were, as you must admit, open, avowed and notorious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>I refer only to the general sacking of private houses &mdash; the pillaging of money, plate, jewels and other light articles of value, with the destruction of books, works of art, paintings, pictures, private manuscripts and family relics; but I allude, besides these things, especially to the hostile acts directly against property of all kinds, as well as outrages upon non-combatants &mdash; to the laying waste of whole sections of country; the attempted annihilation of all the necessaries of life; to the wanton killing, in many instances, of farm stock and domestic animals; the burning of mills, factories and barns, with their contents of grain and forage, not sparing orchards or growing crops, or the implements of husbandry; the mutilation of county and municipal records of great value; the extraordinary efforts made to stir up servile insurrections, involving the wide spread slaughter of women and children; the impious profanation of temples of worship, and even the brutish desecration of the sanctuaries of the dead!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/>All these enormities of a savage character against the very existence of civilized society, and so revolting to the natural sentiments <pb id="p.125" n="125"/>of mankind, when not thoroughly infuriated by the worst of passions, and in open violation of modern usages in war &mdash; were perpetrated by the <rs>Federal</rs> armies in many places throughout the conflict, as legitimate means in putting down the rebellion, so-called!--<hi rend="italics">War Between the <name>States</name></hi>, vol. <num value="2">2</num>, <ref n="pages 507-510">pp. 507-510</ref>.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>Gentlemen &mdash; I have recently seen so many misrepresentations of the action of the late Confederate authorities in relation to prisoners, that I feel it due to the truth of history, and peculiarly incumbent on me as their agent of exchange, to bring to the attention of the country the facts set forth in this paper:</p> 
<div1 id="c.3.16.33" type="section" n="c.3.16.33">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/>The cartel of exchange bears date <dateStruct value="1862-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="22">22d</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>Its chief purpose was to secure the delivery of all prisoners of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>To that end, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article provided that all prisoners of war should be discharged on parole in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after their capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>From the date of the cartel until the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities had the excess of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/>During the interval deliveries were made as fast as the <rs>Federal Government</rs> furnished transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/>Indeed, upon more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion I urged the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to send increased means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>It has never been alleged that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities failed or neglected to make prompt deliveries of prisoners who were not held under charges, when they had the excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/>On the other hand, during the same time the cartel was openly and notoriously violated by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/>Officers and men were kept in confinement, sometimes in irons or doomed to cells, without charge or trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/>Many officers were kept in confinement even after the notices published by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities had declared them exchanged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>In the summer of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities insisted upon limiting exchanges to such as were held in confinement on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>This I resisted as being in violation of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>Such a construction not only kept in confinement the excess on either side but ignored all paroles which were held by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>These were very many, being the paroles of officers and men who had been released on capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>The Federal Government <pb id="p.126" n="126"/>at that time held few or no paroles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>They had all, or nearly all, been surrendered, the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities giving prisoners as equivalent for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>Thus it will be seen that as long as the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> had the excess of prisoners matters went on smoothly enough, but as soon as the posture of affairs in that respect was changed the cartel could no longer be observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>So, as long as the <rs>Federal Government</rs> held the paroles of Confederate officers and men, they were respected, and made the basis of exchange; but when equivalents were obtained for them, and no more were in hand, the paroles which were held by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities could not be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>In consequence of the position thus assumed by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, the requirement of the cartel that all prisoners should be delivered within <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> was practically nullified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>The deliveries which were afterwards made were the results of special agreements.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>The disingenuous attempt is made in both these publications to produce the impression that these sick and emaciated men were fair representatives of the general state of the prisoners held by the <rs>South</rs>, and that all their prisoners were being rapidly reduced to the same state by starvation and cruelty, and by neglect, ill treatment and denial of proper food, stimulants and medicines in the <rs>Confederate</rs> hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>Your committee take pleasure in saying that not only is this charge proved to be wholly false, but the evidence ascertains facts as to the <rs>Confederate</rs> hospitals, in which Northern prisoners of war are treated, highly creditable to the authorities which established them, and to the surgeons and their aids who have so humanely conducted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>The facts are simply these:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>The Federal authorities, in violation of the cartel, having for a long time refused exchange of prisoners, finally consented to a partial exchange of the sick and wounded on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>Accordingly a number of such prisoners were sent from the hospitals in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>General directions had been given that none should be sent except those who might be expected to endure the removal and passage with safety to their lives; but in some cases the surgeons were induced to depart from this rule by the entreaties of some officers and men in the last stages of emaciation, suffering not only with excessive debility, but with <quote>nostalgia,</quote> or home sickness, whose cases were regarded as desperate, and who could not live if they remained, and might possibly improve if carried home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>Thus it happened that some very sick and emaciated men were carried to <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName>, but their illness was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> the result of ill treatment or neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>They might even be found in private families, where the sufferer might be surrounded by every comfort that love could bestow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>Yet these are the cases which, with hideous violation of decency, the <rs>Northern</rs> committee have paraded in pictures and photographs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>They have taken their own sick and enfeebled soldiers; have stripped them naked; have exposed them before a daguerreian apparatus; have pictured every shrunken limb and muscle; and all for the purpose, not of relieving their sufferings, but of bringing a false and slanderous charge against the <rs>South</rs>.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>It is doubtless true that, notwithstanding these facilities, many of the prisoners were lousy and filthy; but it was the result of their own habits, and not of neglect in the discipline or arrangements of the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>The evidence satisfies your committee that this charge is, in all substantial points, untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>For a period of about <num value="1">one</num> month there was a stoppage in the delivery of boxes, caused by a report that the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities were forbidding the delivery of similar supplies to our prisoners.

<head>Why have not prisoners of war been exchanged?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>But the question forces itself upon us why have these sufferings been so long continued?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>Why have not the prisoners of war been exchanged, and thus some of the darkest pages of history spared to the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/>In the answer to this question must be found the test of responsibility for all the sufferings, sickness and heart-broken sorrow that have visited more than <measure n="80000" type="prisoners">eighty thousand prisoners</measure> within the past <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. On this question, your committee can only say that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorties have always desired a prompt and fair exchange of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>Even before the establishment of a cartel they urged such exchange, but could never effect it by agreement, until the large preponderance of prisoners in our hands made it the interest of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to consent to the cartel of <dateStruct value="1863-07-22"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="22">22d</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>Soon after this cartel was established, the policy of the enemy in seducing negro slaves from their masters, arming them and putting white officers over them to lead them against us, gave rise to a few cases in which questions of crime under the internal laws of the <rs>Southern States</rs> appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>Whether men who encouraged insurrection and murder could be held entitled to the privileges of prisoners of war under the cartel, was a grave question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>But these cases were few in number, and ought never to have interrupted the general exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>We were always ready and anxious to carry out the cartel in its true meaning, and it is certain that the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> article required that the prisoners on both sides should be released, and that the few cases as to which misunderstanding occurred should be left for final decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>Doubtless if the preponderance of prisoners had continued with us, exchanges would have continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>But the fortunes of war threw the larger number into the hands of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2034"/>This letter shows clearly, we think, that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, and especially <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0017.00151.01010" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, ought not to be held responsible for the terrible privations, sufferings and injuries which our men had to endure while they were kept in the <rs>Confederate</rs> military prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2035"/>The fact is unquestionable that while the <rs>Confederates</rs> desired to exchange prisoners, to send our men home and to get back their own, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00151.01011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> steadily and strenuously resisted such an exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>While, in his opinion, the prisoners in our hands were well fed, and were in better condition than when they were captured, our prisoners in the <rs>South</rs> were ill fed, and would be restored to us too much exhaused by famine and disease to form a fair set-off against the comparative vigorous men who would be given in exchange.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>This evidence must be taken as conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>It proves that it was not the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities who insisted on keeping our prisoners in distress, want and disease, but the commander of our own armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>We do not say that his reason for this course was not valid; but it was not <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0001.0017.00151.01013" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, or any subordinate or associate of his, who should now be condemned for it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>Moreover, there is no evidence whatever that it was practicable for the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to feed our prisoners any better than they were fed, or to give them better care and attention than they received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>The food was insufficient; the care and attention were insufficient, no doubt; and yet the condition of our prisoners was not worse than that of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers in the field, except in so far as the condition of those in prison must of necessity be worse than that of men who are free and active outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2047"/>Those very unfortunate men were not taken from prisons, but from Confederate hospitals, where they had received the same medical treatment as was given to sick and wounded Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2152"/>The pressure was so great at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and the supplies so scant that prisoners were sent forward while the stockade was only about half finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2153"/>When the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instalment of prisoners arrived, there was no guard at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, and the little squad which had charge of them in the cars bad to remain; and at no time did the guard, efficient and on duty, exceed <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num>, to man the stockade, to guard, and to do general duty and afford relief and enforce discipline over <measure n="34000" type="prisoners">thirty-four thousand prisoners</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2154"/> In regard to the sufferings and mortality among the prisoners at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, none of it arose from the unhealthiness of the locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2155"/>The food, though the same as that used by the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers &mdash; the bread, too, being corn &mdash; was different from that to which they had been accustomed, did not agree with them, and scurvy and diarrhoea prevailed to a considerable extent; neither disease, however, was the result of starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2156"/>That some prisoners did not get their allowance, although a full supply was sent in, is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2157"/>But there not being a guard sufficient to attend to distribution, Federal prisoners were appointed, each having a certain number allotted to his charge, among whom it was his duty to see that every man got his portion, and, as an inducement, this prisoner had special favors and advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2158"/>Upon complaint of those under him, he was broke and another selected; so that it only required good faith on the part of these head men, thus appointed, to insure to each man his share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2159"/>But prisoners would often sell their rations for whiskey and tobacco, and would sell the clothes from their backs for either of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2160"/> In regard to sanitary regulations, there were certain prescribed places and modes for the reception of all filth, and a sluice was made to carry it off; but the most abominable disregard was manifested of all sanitary regulations, and to such a degree that if a conspiracy had been entered into by a large number of the prisoners to cause the utmost filth and stench, it could not have accomplished a more disgusting result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2161"/>Besides which there was a large number of atrocious villians, whose outrages in robbing, beating and murdering their fellow-prisoners must have been the cause, <pb id="p.162" n="162"/>directly or remotely, of very many deaths and of an inconceivable amount of suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>We must recollect that among <measure n="34000" type="prisoners">thirty-four thousand prisoners</measure>, who had encountered the hardships of the fields of many battles, and had had wounds, there were many of delicate physique &mdash; many of respectability &mdash; to whom such self-created filth and such atrocious ruffianism would of itself cause despondency, disease and death; and when, in addition to this, was the conviction that the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, perfectly cognizant of all this, had deliberately consigned them indefinitely to this condition, a consuming despair was superadded to all their other sufferings.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/> The merits of <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> may be summed up by saying that it was of unquestioned healthfulness; it was large enough and had water enough, and could have been made tolerable for the number originally intended for it. It appears that the increase of that number was apparently a matter of necessity for the time; that other sites were selected and prepared with all possible dispatch; that the provisions were similar in amount and quality to those used by Confederate soldiers; that deficient means rendered a supply of clothing, tents and medicines scanty; that the rules of discipline and sanitary regulations of the prison, <hi rend="italics">if complied with by the prisoners</hi>, would have secured to each a supply of food, and have averted almost, if not altogether, the filth and the ruffianism, which <num value="2">two</num> causes, outside of unavoidable sickness, caused the great mass of suffering and mortality.</p></quote> </p>

The camps of the guards all faced the stream, while their sinks were far off in the rear, and orders were most strict not to muddy the water, much less defile it in any way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/>A more senseless hue and cry was never heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>It appears, then, from the foregoing statements that the prison at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was established with a view to healthfulness of location, and that the great mortality which ensued resulted chiefly from the crowded condition of the stockade, the use of corn bread, to which the prisoners had not been accustomed, the want of variety in the rations furnished, and the want of medicines and hospital stores to enable our surgeons properly to treat the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> point, the reply is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>The stockade at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was originally designed for a much smaller number of prisoners than were afterwards crowded into it. But prisoners accumulated &mdash; after the stoppage of exchange &mdash; in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and at other points; the <name>Dahlgren</name> raid &mdash; which had for its avowed object the liberation of the prisoners, the assassination of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0001.0017.00179.01114" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his Cabinet, and the sacking of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; warned our authorities against allowing large numbers of prisoners to remain in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, even if the difficulty of feeding them there was removed; and the only alternative was to rush them down to <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, as enough men to guard them elsewhere could not be spared from the ranks of our armies, which were now everywhere fighting overwhelming odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>We have a statement from an entirely trustworthy source that the reason prisoners were not detailed to cut timber with which to enlarge the stockade and build shelters, is, that this privilege <hi rend="italics">was</hi> granted to a large number of them when the prison was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> established, they giving their parole of honor not to attempt to escape; and that they <hi rend="italics">violated their paroles, threw away their axes, and spread dismay throughout that whole region by creating the impression that all of the prisoners had broken loose</hi>. This experiment could not, of course, be repeated, and the rest had to suffer for the bad faith of these, who not only prevented the detail of any numbers of other prisoners for this work, but made way with axes which could not be replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>In reference to feeding the prisoners on corn bread, there has been the loudest complaints and the bitterest denunciations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>They had not been accustomed to such hard fare as <quote>hog and hominy,</quote> and the poor fellows did suffer fearfully from it. <hi rend="italics">But the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers had the same rations</hi>. Our soldiers had the advantage of buying supplies and of receiving occasional boxes from home, which the prisoners at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> could have enjoyed to an even greater extent had the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities been willing to accept the humane proposition of our <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioner</rs> of Exchange &mdash; to allow each side to send supplies to their prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2364"/>But why did not the <rs>Confederacy</rs> furnish better <pb id="p.180" n="180"/>rations to both our own soldiers and our prisoners?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2365"/>and why were the prisoners at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> not supplied with <hi rend="italics">wheat</hi> bread instead of <hi rend="italics">corn</hi> bread?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2366"/>Answers to these questions may be abundantly found by referring to the orders of <persName n="Pope,Major-General,John,,," id="n0001.0017.00180.01115" reg="default:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>, directing his men <quote>to live on the country</quote> ; the orders of <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00180.01116" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in fulfilling his avowed purpose to <quote>make <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> howl</quote> as he <quote>smashed things generally</quote> in that <quote>great march,</quote> which left smoking, blackened ruins and desolated fields to mark his progress; the orders of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00180.01117" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to his <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, to desolate the rich wheat-growing Valley of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; or the reports of <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n0001.0017.00180.01118" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Irish-Yankee,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, boasting of the number of barns he had burned, the mills he had destroyed, and the large amount of wheat he had given to the flames, until there was really more truth than poetry in his boast that he-had made the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName> <quote>such a waste that even a crow flying over would be compelled to carry his own rations.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2367"/>We have these and other similar orders of Federal <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in our archives (we propose to give hereafter a few choice extracts from them), and we respectfully submit that, for the <rs>South</rs> to be abused for not furnishing Federal prisoners with better rations, when our own soldiers and people had been brought painfully near the starvation point by the mode of warfare which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> adopted, is even more unreasonable than the course of the old <placeName key="tgn,7016833" n="1.000 10" reg="Misr,Africa">Egyptian</placeName> task-masters, who required their captives to <quote>make brick without straw.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2368"/>And to the complaints that the sick did not have proper medical attention, we reply that the hospital at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was placed on <hi rend="italics">precisely the same footing as the hospitals for the treatment of our own soldiers</hi>. We have the law of the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> enjoining this, and the orders of the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</rs> enforcing it. Besides, we have in our archives a large budget of original orders, telegrams, letters, &amp;c., which passed between the officers on duty at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> and their superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>We have carefully looked through this large mass of papers, and we have been unable to discover <hi rend="italics">a single sentence</hi> indicating that the prisoners were to be treated otherwise than kindly, or that the hospital was to receive a smaller supply of medicines or of stores than the hospitals for Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>On the contrary, the whole of these papers go to show that the prison hospital at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> was <hi rend="italics">on the same footing precisely</hi> with every hospital for sick or wounded Confederates, and that the scarcity of medicines and hospital stores, of which there was such constant complaint, proceeded from causes which our authorities could not control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/><pb id="p.181" n="181"/></p> 
<p>But we can make the case still stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2372"/>Whose fault was it that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was utterly unable to supply medicines for the hospitals of either friend or foe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2373"/>Most unquestionably the responsibility rests with the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2374"/>They not only declared medicines <quote>contraband of war</quote> --even arresting ladies coming South for concealing a little quinine under their skirts &mdash; but they sanctioned the custom of their soldiers to sack every drug store in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> which they could reach, and to destroy even the little stock of medicines which the private physician might chance to have on hand.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>General &mdash; At your request I cheerfully reduce to writing the facts stated by me in our conversation this morning, for preservation in the archives of your society, and as bearing upon a historical question &mdash; the treatment of prisoners during our late civil war, which it seems certain politicians of the vindictive type in the <rs>North</rs>, led by a Presidential aspirant, have deemed it essential to their party success to thrust upon the country again in the beginning of this our centennial year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>It is to be hoped that after a lapse of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> since we of the <rs>South</rs> grounded our arms, passion has so far yielded to patriotism, reason, and sentiments of a common humanity in the minds and hearts of the great mass of intelligent people at the <rs>North</rs>, that all the facts relating to the great struggle between the <name>States</name> of the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> may be calmly presented, if not for final decision by this generation, at least to aid impartial mankind in the future to judge correctly between the conquering and the vanquished parties to the contest; and to fix the responsibility where it attaches, to the <num value="1">one</num> side or the other, or to both, for sufferings inflicted that were not necessarily incident to a state of war between contending <name>Christian</name> powers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>I went within the stockade and conversed with many of the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>I found the prison and its inmates in a bad condition: not as bad as our enemies have represented, yet unfortunately bad. The location of the stockade was good, and had been judiciously chosen for healthfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>It occupied <num value="2">two</num> gently sloping hillsides, with a clear flowing brook dividing them; and being in the sandy portion of the pine woods of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, it was free from <pb id="p.190" n="190"/>local malaria, and had the benefit of a genial and healthy climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>The great mortality of the previous year, I have no doubt, resulted in part from an excess of prisoners over the fair capacity of the stockade, and from the lack of sufficient shelter from the sun and rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/>Before my arrival at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, <persName n="Wirz,Captain,,,," id="n0001.0018.00190.01202" reg="nearbymention:Wirz,H.,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wirz</surname></persName> had, by a communication forwarded through <persName n="Gibbs,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0018.00190.01203" reg="nearbymention:Gibbs,G.,C.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Gibbs</surname></persName>, and approved by him, called my attention to the great deficiency of shelter in the stockade, and asked authority to supply it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>In consequence of this want of buildings and shedding within the stockade, the prisoners had excavated a great many subterranean vaults and chambers in the hillsides, which many of them occupied, to the injury of their health, as these places were not sufficiently ventilated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>The prisoners were very badly off for clothing, shoes and hats, and complained of this destitution, and of the quantity and kind of rations &mdash; corn bread and bacon chiefly &mdash; issued to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2502"/>I found, what I anticipated, that we had no clothing to give them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2503"/>Many of the men on duty as guards were in rags, and either barefooted, or had their feet protected with worn out shoes held together with strings and thongs, and in lieu of overcoats many had to protect themselves against inclement weather with a tattered blanket drawn over the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2504"/>Our own men being in this destitute condition, it can be well understood that we could not supply a large demand for clothing prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2505"/>They also suffered greatly, and there had been great mortality, for want of suitable medicines to treat the diseases incident to their condition with any considerable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2506"/>From this cause, and this alone, I have no doubt <num value="1000">thousands</num> died at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, who would be living to-day if the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2507"/>The object of this barbarous decree against the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it is now well understood, was to expose our soldiers, as well as our wives, children and families, without protection or relief, to the diseases common in our climate, and to make us an easy prey to death, approach us in what form he might; not foreseeing, perhaps, that when the grim monster stalked through our prisons he would find not alone <hi rend="italics">Confederates</hi> for his victims, but the stalwart soldiers of the <rs>Government</rs> which had invoked his aid against us. At the time of my inspection, there was a good deal of sickness amongst the prisoners, but not a large percentage of mortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2508"/>Our <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs>, even with their scanty pharmacopae, gave equal attention to sick friends and enemies, to guard and to prisoners alike.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2509"/>I investigated particularly the food question, and found that no <pb id="p.191" n="191"/>discrimination was made in the issue of rations to guards and prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2510"/>In quantity, quality and kind the daily supply was exactly the same, man for man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2513"/>The food was sound and wholesome, but meagre in quantity, and not such in kind and variety as Federal soldiers had been accustomed to draw from their abundant commissariat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2514"/>Our soldiers did very well on <quote>hog and hominy,</quote> and rarely complained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2515"/>The Federals thought it horrible to have nothing else, and but a scanty supply of this simple food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2516"/>Great scoundrelism was detected amongst the prisoners in cheating each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>The prisoners knew of the failure of this mission when I was at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, and the effect was to plunge the great majority of them into the deepest melancholy, home-sickness and despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/>They believed their confinement would continue till the end of the war, and many of them looked upon that as a period so indefinite and remote that they believed that they would die of their sufferings before the day of release came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/>I explained to them the efforts we had made and were still making to effect an exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>I ordered it, and thereafter daily a <num value="100">hundred</num> or more prisoners were paroled and set to work in the neighboring forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>In the course of a fortnight comfortable log houses, with floors and good chimneys &mdash; for which the prisoners made and burnt the brick &mdash; were erected for <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men, and were occupied by those in feeble health, who were withdrawn from the large stockade and separated from the mass of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>There were <num value="1000">thousands</num> of hides at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, from the young cattle butchered during the previous <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs>, whilst the country yet contained such animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>I ordered this, too; and a few weeks later many of the barefooted prisoners were supplied with rough,but comfortable shoes; <num value="1">one</num> of them made and sent to me a pair that surprised me, both by the quality of the leather and the style of the shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/>Another suggestion came from the medical staff of the post that I ordered to be at once put into practice: it was to brew corn beer for those suffering from scorbutic taint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>The <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>--or even whole corn &mdash; being scalded in hot water and a mash made of it, a little yeast was added to promote fermentation, and in a few days a sharp acid beverage was produced, by no means unpalatable, and very wholesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>I mention these facts to show that he was not the monster he was afterwards represented to be, when his blood was called for by infuriate fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>I would have proved these facts if I had been permitted to testify on his trial after I was summoned before the court by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and have substantiated them by the records of the prison and of my own headquarters, if these records were not destroyed, suppressed or mutilated at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>I put these facts on record now to vindicate, as far as <pb id="p.193" n="193"/>they go, his memory from the monstrous crimes falsely charged against him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>After having given my sanction and orders to carry out every suggestion of others, or that occurred to my own mind for the amelioration of the condition of the prisoners as far as we possessed the means, and having issued stringent orders to preserve discipline amongst the guarding troops, and subordination, quiet and good order amongst the prisoners, I went to <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> to confer with <persName n="Cobb,General,Howell,,," id="n0001.0018.00193.01213" reg="default:Cobb,Howell,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Howell</foreName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pillow,General,Gideon,J.,," id="n0001.0018.00193.01214" reg="default:Pillow,Gideon,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Gideon</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName> as to the proper course for me to pursue in the event of our situation in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> becoming more precarious, or the chance of communication with the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> being entirely cut off, which appeared to be an almost certain event in the very near future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>After a full discussion of the situation, there was perfect accord in our views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>There was eminent propriety, therefore, in our conferring with each other, and acting harmoniously in whatever course might be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/><persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n0001.0018.00193.01217" reg="nearbymention:Pillow,Gideon,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName> took a leading part in the discussion, and in shaping the conclusions to which we came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>In the absence of official information or instructions from <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n0001.0018.00193.01218" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName>, we acted upon what the newspapers announced as a recently established arrangement with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0001.0018.00193.01219" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, which was, in effect, that either side might deliver to the other on parole, but without exchange, any prisoners they chose, taking simply a receipt for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/>We had no official information of any such agreement from our Government, but it was regarded by us as very probably true, and we decided to act upon it. The difficulty of supplying the prisoners with even a scanty ration of <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> and bacon was increasing daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/>The cotton States had never been a grazing country, and therefore we had few or no animals left there for food, except hogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>These States were not a large wheat producing region, and for that reason we had to depend mainly on corn for bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/>Salt was scarce and hard to obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>Vegetables we had none for army purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/>We were destitute of clothing, and of the materials and machinery to manufacture it in sufficient quantities for our own soldiers and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/>And the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, remaining deaf to all appeals for exchange of prisoners, it was manifest that the incarceration of their captured soldiers could no longer be of any possible advantage to us, since to relieve their sufferings that government would take no step, if it involved a similar release of our men in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/>Indeed, it was manifest that they looked upon it as an advantage to them and an injury to us to leave their <pb id="p.194" n="194"/>prisoners in our hands to eat out our little remaining substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>In view of all these facts and considerations, <persName n="Cobb,General,,,," id="n0001.0018.00194.01220" reg="nearbymention:Cobb,Howell,,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n0001.0018.00194.01221" reg="nearbymention:Pillow,Gideon,J.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Pillow</surname></persName> and I were of <num value="1">one</num> mind that the best thing that could be done was, without further efforts to get instructions from <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n0001.0018.00194.01222" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName>, to make arrangements to send off all the prisoners we had at <placeName key="tgn,7014121" n="1.000 14" reg="eufaula, barbour, alabama">Eufaula</placeName> and <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName> to the nearest accessible Federal post, and having paroled them not to bear arms till regularly exchanged, to deliver them unconditionally, simply taking a receipt on descriptive rolls of the men thus turned over.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/>In pursuance of this determination, and as soon as the necessary arrangements could be made, a detachment of about <num value="1500">1,500</num> men, made up from the <num value="2">two</num> prisons, was sent to <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson, Mississippi</placeName>, by rail and delivered to their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>Shocked at such a waste of human life, produced by the fraudulent refusal to observe the cartel for exchange of prisoners, whom we had neither the force to guard in a large enclosure, nor proper food for when sick, nor medicines, save such as we could smuggle into our ports or manufacture from the plants of Southern growth, I took the report to <persName n="Campbell,Judge,,,," id="n0001.0019.00200.01284" reg="nearbymention:Campbell,J.,A.,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Campbell</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary of War">Assistant Secretary of War</rs>, and told him of the horrors it disclosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>My office was between that of the <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Secretary">Assistant Secretary</rs> and the <rs>Secretary</rs>, and the latter passed through mine with the paper in his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>I testified to these facts before the <rs>Wirz Commission</rs>, and also to this further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>He expressed himself as very unwilling to lie under such an imputation, and urgently desirous to have the subject investigated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>His appearance and manner were very good-those of a gentleman and a man of honor; and, in sympathy with his feelings (though I told him that it was extremely improbable that officers of suitable rank could be spared from the service to conduct such an investigation at that time), I told him I would call the attention of the <rs>Secretary</rs> to the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>Accordingly I got the report, and placing around it a slip of paper in the usual official manner, I endorsed to this effect: <quote><persName n="Chandler,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0019.00200.01290" reg="nearbymention:Chandler,D.,T.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Chandler</surname></persName> is here in person, urging that a <orgName n="Inquiry Court" type="court">court of inquiry</orgName> be named to investigate the issues between him and <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00200.01291" reg="nearbymention:Winder,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> touching this report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>This endorsement of mine, dated in <dateStruct value="1864-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, was the thing which connected me with the report, and caused me to be summoned to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to trace it into the hands of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>This was substantially all that I knew of my own knowledge, and so was competent to prove as a witness, in respect to the report.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2676"/> <quote>Unfortunately, during my imprisonment after the war, nearly all the papers and memoranda I had connected with the administration of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> were destroyed, and I have had so little satisfaction in dwelling upon the sad sacrifices and sufferings that attended and resulted from the futile though glorious efforts <pb id="p.204" n="204"/>of our people in their lost cause, that I have sought rather to allow my memories of events to be dimmed or obliterated, than to brighten or cherish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2677"/>I have not a copy of any of my own reports, nor of that of <persName n="Chandler,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0019.00204.01339" reg="nearbymention:Chandler,D.,T.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Chandler</surname></persName>, to which you specially refer, and have of that by no means a lively recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2678"/>I do remember however, generally, that it severely reflected on <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00204.01340" reg="nearbymention:Winder,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, and while it induced calls for explanation and defence from <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00204.01341" reg="nearbymention:Winder,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, it at the same time, from its terms, inspired an impression of controversy, and perhaps angry and incautious expressions between them, which warned to caution in receiving them as accurate representations of the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2679"/>The Department was aware of the strict instructions which had been given, both verbally and by written orders, for the selection and preparation of the military prisons, especially that of <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, with special view to the health and comfort of the prisoners, and for their humane treatment and supply on the same footing with our own troops, and could not hastily accept an account of such orders being wantonly disregarded by an old, regularly trained officer, rather noted as a rigid disciplinarian, or of cruel and unofficer-like treatment of prisoners on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2680"/>The authorities, too, knew only too well the grave and growing deficiencies of all supplies, and the sad necessities the war was by its ruthless conduct imposing on all affected by its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2681"/>They also knew that unexpected events had forced the assemblage of a far greater number of prisoners than had been anticipated and provided for in the few safer points of confinement, before others had or could be provided for them, and we were daily looking and counting on a large number being removed by the liberal offer of some <num value="10000">10,000</num> of those suffering from sickness to be returned (without equivalent) to the <rs>Federals</rs>; and on the completion of new, safe prisons for the accommodation of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2682"/>The Department, under such circumstances, could not so hastily receive and act on the representations of this report, or condemn <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00204.01342" reg="nearbymention:Winder,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> without investigation and response from him. His reports and explanations were of a very different character, and, as far as I now recollect, deemed exonerating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2683"/>I cannot recall exactly the time or circumstances of his promotion as General, but certainly no advance was ever accorded under any conviction of inhumanity or undue severity to prisoners by him, much less as a support to him therein, or a reward for such conduct.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2689"/>Dear Sir &mdash; Your letter reached me some <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> since, and I have been prevented by serious indisposition from giving it an early reply.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2690"/>I take pleasure in rendering my emphatic testimony to relieve the character and reputation of your father, the late <persName n="Winder,General,John,H.,," id="n0001.0019.00205.01350" reg="default:Winder,John,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, from the unjust aspersions that have been cast upon them in connection with the treatment of the <rs>Federal</rs> prisoners under his charge during our late civil war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>I had, privately and officially, the fullest opportunity of knowing his character, and judging his disposition and conduct towards the <rs>Federal</rs> prisoners; for those in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, where he was almost daily in official communication with me, often in respect to them, had been some time under his command before, in large measure from the care and kindness he was believed to have shown to them, he was sent South to have the supervision and control of the large number there being aggregated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>His manner and mode of speech were perhaps naturally somewhat abrupt and sharp, and his military bearing may have added more of sternness and imperiousness; but these were mere superficial traits, perhaps, as I sometimes thought, assumed in a manner to disguise the real gentleness and kindness of his nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>I thought him marked by real humanity towards the weak and helpless &mdash; such as women and children, for instance &mdash; by that spirit <pb id="p.206" n="206"/>of protection and defence which distinguished the really gallant soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>To me he always expressed sympathy, and manifested a strong desire to provide for the wants and comforts of the prisoners under his charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>Very frequently, from the urgency of his claims in behalf of the prisoners while in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, controversies would arise between him and the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs>, which were submitted to me by them in person for my decision, and I was struck by his earnestness and zeal in claiming the fullest supplies the law of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> allowed or gave color of claim to. This law required prisoners to have the allowance provided for our own soldiers in the field, and constituted the guide to the settlement of such questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>Strict injunctions were invariably given from the <name>Department</name> for the observance of this law, both then and afterwards, in the <rs>South</rs>, and no departure was to be tolerated from it except under the direst straits of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>Your father was ever resolved, as far as his authority allowed, to act upon and enforce the rule in behalf of the prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>When sent South I know he was most solicitous in regard to all arrangements for salubrity and convenience of location for the military prisons, and for all means that could facilitate the supplies and comforts of the prisoners, and promote their health and preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>That afterwards great sufferings were endured by the prisoners in the <rs>South</rs> was among the saddest necessities of the war; but they were due, in a large measure, to the cessation of exchange, which forced the crowding of numbers, never contemplated, in the limited prison bounds which could be considered safe in the <rs>South</rs>, to the increasing danger of attack on such places, which made Southern authorities and commanders hostile to the establishment of additional prisons in convenient localities, and to the daily increasing straits and deficiencies of supplies of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and not to the want of sympathy or humanity on the part of your father, or his most earnest efforts to obviate and relieve the inevitable evils that oppressed the unfortunate prisoners.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>I myself can recall no occasion when Federal prisoners were or could have been employed, as alleged by that General, even had it been legitimate, and not a shocking inhumanity, to do so; that is to say, I do not believe <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00208.01370" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> can specify, with date, any place that came into possession of the <rs>Confederates</rs> during the war, where torpedoes were planted, which they had to remove either by resort to the use of Federal prisoners or any other means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>There certainly was never such a place or occasion in the departments which I commanded.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>I further recollect that your brother answered that, under his instructions from the <rs>Confederate</rs> <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, he could not comply; also that, in his belief, prisoners could not right-fully be so employed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>Close by, on the corner of a fence, was a group of men standing around a handsome young officer, whose foot had been blown to pieces by a torpedo planted in the road. * * * * He told me that he was riding along with the rest of his brigade staff of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 17">Seventeenth Corps</orgName>, when a torpedo, trodden on by his horse, had exploded, killing the horse and literally blowing off all the flesh from <num value="1">one</num> of his legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>I saw the terrible wound and made full inquiry into the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>There had been no resistance at that point; nothing to give warning of the danger; the <rs>Rebels</rs> had planted <measure n="8inch" type="distance">eight inch</measure> shells in the road with friction matches to explode them by being trodden on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>I immediately ordered a lot of Rebel prisoners to be brought from the <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName> with picks and shovels, and made them march in close order along the road, so as to explode or discover and dig them up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>Here we have his own confession that he pushed a mass of unarmed men, prisoners of war, ahead of his column to explode torpedoes, which he apprehended were planted in the approaches to a strongly fortified position, his ability to carry which he greatly doubted, as may be seen from his <quote>Memoirs.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>He does not there pretend that he acted <quote>in retaliation</quote> at all, but because, forsooth he was <quote>angry</quote> that <num value="1">one</num> of his officers had been badly wounded by a torpedo which had been planted in his path <quote>without giving warning of danger</quote> ! Surely his own narrative, with its painful levity, gives as bad a hue to the affair as <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00209.01375" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s worst enemies could desire.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>His manner of relating the incidents, which I have quoted in his own words, is calculated to give the impression that the use of the torpedoes is something so abhorrent in regular warfare that he could subject his unarmed prisoners to the hazard of exploding them and deserve credit for the act!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>Moreover, the version of <quote>S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>In addition to his attempt to show me to be a felon, does he desire to take from me <quote>the benefit of clergy</quote> ? When this letter of mine appeared in the <rs>Washington</rs> <hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi>, in <dateStruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>, I addressed a communication to the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName></hi>, which was published in that paper on the <dateStruct value="1868-08-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> <month reg="08">August</month>, <year>1868</year>,</dateStruct> explaining the circumstances under which it was written, and showing very clearly that the latter paragraph of it did not relate to soldiers at all. In that communication I stated what I now repeat &mdash; that some <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> political prisoners had arrived at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, and being anxious not to detain the <rs>Federal</rs> steamer, I wrote to <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00212.01390" reg="nearbymention:Winder,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> to send all the political prisoners he had in his charge, as well as soldiers; that it was as to these political prisoners that I wrote the last paragraph in the letter; that it so manifestly appeared from the context; that every word in the paragraph was true, both as to the class received and those sent off; that not <num value="1">one</num> Confederate soldier in service was received at that time; that scarcely any <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> had been in prison a month; that all of them had been recently arrested as sympathizers with the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause; that those sent off were miserable wretches indeed, mostly robbers and incendiaries from <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, who were Confederates when <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> occupied their country, and <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n0001.0019.00212.01391" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName> when Federal troops held it, and who in turn preyed upon <num value="1">one</num> side and the other, and so pillaged that portion of the <rs>State</rs> that it had almost been given over to desolation; that they were men without character or principle, who were ready to take any oath or engage in any work of plunder; that I then reiterated what I had before written &mdash; that they were <quote>a set of miserable wretches</quote> ; that the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers who had passed through my hands knew well, I hoped, that I would not have applied any such phrase to them; and especially so if the calamities of prison life had prostrated them, and that inasmuch as in my letter I had referred to an arrangement which I had made, I must have referred to the exchange of political prisoners which I had just negotiated, and not to the exchange of military prisoners, which was negotiated by the cartel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>After this full and frank explanation of the letter, nothing more for some <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> was heard of it, until it was revived in a false, forged and garbled form by <quote>S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>a few weeks since.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>Before its publication in the <hi rend="italics">Chronicle</hi>, it had, however, appeared in the famous <persName n="Wirz,,,,," id="n0001.0019.00212.01392" reg="mostcommon:Wirz,Henry,,,:5"><surname>Wirz</surname></persName> trial &mdash; whether in its true or false form, I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>In this respect the letter was more fortunate than I was, for I was not permitted to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>I went to <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> in obedience to the summons, and was in attendance upon the court martial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>I venture to assert that this was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case where it ever happened, even in countries more unhappy than our own, that a witness who had been duly summoned for the defence was dismissed by the prosecution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>In my letter to <persName n="Wood,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0019.00213.01394" reg="mostcommon:Wood,J.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, the chief complaint that I made against <quote>S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>was that he published only a part of my letter to <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n0001.0019.00213.01395" reg="nearbymention:Winder,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName> and ignored the remainder, which was a full explanation of what he did publish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>The matter of dates to which I referred was merely incidental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>Now, <quote>S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>in his reply has a good deal to say about the matter of dates, without pretending to excuse himself for garbling the body of the letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>Whether he has any excuse I know not, but I certainly do know that he has offered none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>When I charge him with suppressing a material part of my letter, a part which gave full explanation, it will not do for <quote>S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>to ignore such charge; and launch out into explanations,. satisfactory or unsatisfactory, about a mere change of dates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>In his last communication, <quote>S.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>seeks to answer what I had declared in my letter to <persName n="Wood,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0019.00213.01396" reg="mostcommon:Wood,J.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, to wit: That the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities were responsible for the suffering of Federal prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>I referred to a certain statement of mine published in <dateStruct value="1868-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>, in the <orgName n="Saint Louis Times" type="newspaper">Saint Louis <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> and <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName></hi>. I herewith send a copy of that statement, and beg, in the interest of the truth of history, that you will republish it. I ask it, not in the interest of hate, nor to revive sectional controversy, nor to inflame the now subsiding passions of war. Least of all do I desire to put any stigma upon the people of the <rs>North</rs>, for the sin was that of individuals, and they few in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>I think, if a due investigation were made, it would be found that the number of sinners would not exceed <num value="6">a half dozen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>I substantially proposed.in my statement to prove my case by Federal testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>The witnesses are alive now, and the proofs at hand, if the archives have not been mutilated or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>The due investigation of such matter, if prosecuted with judicial fairness, instead of increasing any feeling of hate between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, would tend to allay it. It would conclusively show that the sections were not to be blamed; that the people on both sides were not justly amenable to any reproach; that honor, integrity and <name>Christian</name> civilization in the main reigned <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>; that maltreatment of the defenceless and suffering was loathed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>alike by Federal and Confederate people; that the story of their participation in or countenance of such wrongs is a shameless libel, and that our civil war, although necessarily harsh and brutal in its general aspect, was illustrated on both sides by high and shining examples of moderation, kindness, good faith, generosity and knightly courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>I do not believe that an investigation which would develop these facts would tend to fan into a flame the old passions of the war. So far from that, I believe it would serve to make us respect each other the more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>It is true that the national wrath might fall upon a few persons who really are <pb id="p.214" n="214"/>the only ones who are responsible for the frightful miseries of the prisoners of the war; but such a result, even independent of the vindication of the truth, would be far better than that the people of either side should believe that the other, even under the promptings of evil passions, joined in a crusade against the helpless and suffering.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>The statement which I ask you to publish contains a reference to only some of the points and some of the proofs which can be brought forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>I seek not to make myself prominent, or to bring myself unduly forward in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>I wish the cup could pass from me. But the official position which I. occupied during the war, as well as the fact that the propositions looking to the relief of prisoners went through my hands, seems to require that I should step to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>When I do; I hope that my conduct may be marked by becoming modesty and firmness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>In my letter to <persName n="Wood,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0019.00214.01397" reg="mostcommon:Wood,J.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, I stated that <quote>every <num value="1">one</num> of the many propositions for the relief of Federal prisoners, which I not only made, but pressed upon the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, was uniformly disregarded.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>The proof of that is found in the statement which I now ask you to publish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>I do not know whether this evidence conforms to the truth or not. But, admitting that it does, how does it answer the charge that I proposed to exchange officer for officer and man for man; or the charge that I proposed that the prisoners on each side should be attended by a proper number of <hi rend="italics">their own surgeons</hi>, who, under rules to be established, should be permitted to take charge of their health and comfort, with authority, also, to receive and distribute such contributions of money, food, clothing and medicine, as might be forwarded for the relief of prisoners; or the charge that I offered to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities their sick and wounded, without requiring any equivalent; or the charge that I offered to make purchases of medicines from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities, to be used exclusively for the relief of Federal prisoners, paying therefor in gold, cotton or tobacco, at double or thrice the price, if required, and giving assurances that the medicines so bought would be used exclusively in the treatment of Federal prisoners, and, indeed, that they might be brought within our lines by Federal surgeons and dispensed by them?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>The mere fact that I offered these prisoners, without requiring equivalents, is very strong proof of itself of our inability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>It will be observed that my declaration of utter inability to provide for the prisoners follows immediately my statement of the monthly mortality at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>When about to leave for <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, where, of course, <placeName reg="Camp Chase">Camp Chase</placeName> checks would be useless, the sutler made it convenient not to be on hand to redeem his paper, so my friend lost all the little money he had. We marched from <placeName reg="Camp Chase">Camp Chase</placeName> to <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklin, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus</placeName>, where we took the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>This march was brutally conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>Several of our number were sick, and yet the whole party was made to double quick nearly the whole distance--<measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>. The excuse was, that otherwise <quote>we would be too late for the train.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>But why not have made an earlier start?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>or why not have waited for the next train?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>We traveled all day, reached <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> in the night, worn out and hungry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>I stayed at <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> from about <dateStruct value="-11-20"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="-04-26"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="26">26th</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/>During this time, in common with many others, I suffered a good deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>Prisoners who were supplied by friends in the <rs>North</rs> got along very well, but those altogether dependent upon the tender mercies of the <rs>Government</rs> were poorly off indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>I was among the latter for sometime &mdash; not having been able to communicate with my friends until the middle of <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>But the New Year brought me supplies and <hi rend="italics">letters more precious</hi> than bank notes, even to <num value="0.5">a half</num> starved, shivering prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/><pb id="p.246" n="246"/>The building in which I stayed was a simple weather-boarded house, through which the wind blew and the snow beat at will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>It is true many of the buildings were quite comfortable, but I speak of my own experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>The <dateStruct value="1864-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> was said by all to be the coldest weather ever known at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>It was so cold that the sentinels were taken off for fear of their freezing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>Wherever the air struck the face the sensation was that of ice pressed hard against it. Yet cold as it was, we were without fire n my room from <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the evening to <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>I went to my bed, which consisted of <num value="2">two</num> blankets, <num value="1">one</num> to lie upon and <num value="1">one</num> to cover with, but sleep was out of the question under such circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>So I got up, got together several fellow-prisoners, and kept up the circulation of blood and spirits until day light by dancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>My chum, unfortunately, stayed in our bunk &mdash; the consequence was, he was unable to get his boots on, so badly were his feet frost-bitten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3344"/>During my stay in this prison, there was at times a scarcity of water, sufficient not only to inconvenience us, but to cause actual suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3345"/>The wells from which we got our supply were shallow, and were generally exhausted early in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3346"/>We were surrounded by a lake of water whence we might have been allowed a plentiful supply, but the fear of our escaping was so great that we were never allowed to go to the lake except through a long line of guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3347"/>This opportunity was given once a day, except when the wells were frozen so that no water could be got from them at all, then we had access to the lake twice a day. In this prison, as in all others in which it was my misfortune to be confined, we were liable to be shot at at any time, and for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3348"/>I remember <num value="3">three</num> different times that the room I stayed in was fired into at night because the sentinel said we had lights burning, when to my certain knowledge there was no light in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3349"/>The authorities had rules stuck up, the observance of which, they said, would insure safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3350"/>It is true, the non-observance of them would almost certainly entail death or a wound, but the converse was by no means true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3351"/>Sentinels interpreted rules as they pleased, and fired upon us at the dictation of their cowardly hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3352"/>In no instance have I seen or heard of their being punished for it, though it was clearly proven that the sufferer violated no rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3353"/>This prison afforded opportunity for the exhibition of a spirit characteristic of our people, and which, now they are overpowered and under the heel of oppression, is still manifested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3354"/>It is that spirit of self-reliance and submission to the will of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, which, added to a conscious rectitude of purpose, bids men make the best of their circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3355"/>This spirit showed itself at <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> in the efforts made to pass the time pleasantly and profitably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3356"/>Schools, debating clubs, and games of all kinds were in vogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3357"/>There were all kinds of shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3358"/><persName n="Shoemaker,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00246.01707" reg="mostcommon:Shoemaker,nomatch:0"><surname>Shoemaker</surname></persName>, black-smith, tailor, jeweler, storekeeper, were all found carrying on their respective business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3359"/>The impression is upon my mind of many disagreeable, unkind, and oppressive measures taken by the authorities, <pb id="p.247" n="247"/>but the very severe treatment to which I was afterwards subjected so far threw them into the shade that they have escaped my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3360"/>I must not omit a statement about food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3361"/>At <placeName reg="Camp Chase">Camp Chase</placeName> my rations were of a good quality and sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3362"/>At <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> they were not so good nor near so plentiful, though sufficient to keep a man in good health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3363"/>While at <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, I made <num value="2">two</num> attempts to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3364"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt was in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>. <num value="6">Six</num> of us started a tunnel from under <num value="1">one</num> of the buildings, with the intention of coming to the surface outside of the pen surrounding the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3365"/>Our intention then was to swim to the nearest point of mainland, about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile distant, and then make across the country for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3366"/>We had with infinite labor, during <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> nights, made a considerable hole, and were in high spirits at the prospect, when <num value="1">one</num> night there came a tremendous rain, which caved in our tunnel and blasted our hopes for that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3367"/>My next attempt was on the <dateStruct value="1864-01-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> during the intensely cold weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3368"/>I succeeded in getting to the fence where the sentinel was posted, but the guard was so vigilant it was impossible to get over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3369"/>I lay by the fence until nearly frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3370"/>The moon shone out brightly, and I had to run for my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3371"/>In the beginning of spring an exchange of sick and disabled prisoners was agreed upon between the <num value="2">two</num> Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3372"/>I had been very unwell for some <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. Accordingly I went before the board of physicians, which decided I was a fit subject for exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3373"/>On the <dateStruct value="-04-26"><day reg="26">26th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, in company with <measure n="140" type="sick">one hundred and forty sick</measure>, I left <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, fully believing that in a few days I would be once more in dear old Dixie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3374"/>We traveled by rail to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, thence we went by steamer to <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3375"/>Here I drank to the dregs the cup of <quote>Hope deferred that maketh the heart sick.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3376"/>Every few days we were told we would certainly leave for the <rs>South</rs> by the next boat &mdash; once all of us were actually called up to sign the parole not to take up arms, etc., until regularly exchanged &mdash; but the order was countermanded before <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of us had signed the roll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3377"/>I never before nor since felt so sick at heart as then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3378"/>My disappointments of the same character have been many, but that overstepped them all. All faith in the truth of any Government official was then shattered forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3379"/>The greater part of my time at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> was passed in the hospital, where I was very well treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3380"/>The sick were not closely guarded, and had the privilege of the whole Point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3381"/>It was no small consolation to sit for hours on the beach, the fresh breeze blowing in your face, the free waters rolling endless before you (moodful as nature's own child, sparkling with infinite lustre in the sunshine of a calm day, kissing with a soft murmur of welcome the gentle breeze or struggling with an angry roar in the embrace of the tempest), and miles distant was the <rs>Virginia</rs> shore, and I have often thought I might claim a kindred feeling with the prophet viewing from <placeName key="tgn,2060106" n="1.000 2" reg="pisgah, cooper, missouri">Pisgah</placeName> the land he might not reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3382"/>About the middle of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> the hospital was crowded with wounded <pb id="p.248" n="248"/><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> sent from <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00248.01708" reg="mostcommon:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,:4"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3383"/>This necessitated our removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3384"/>Accordingly we were sent out to the regular prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3385"/>There we lived in tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>We still had <num value="1">one</num> luxury &mdash; sea bathing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>The drinking water here was very injurious &mdash; caused diarrhoea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>About this time rations were reduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>We were cut down to <num value="2">two</num> meals a day. Coffee and sugar were stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>The ration was a <hi rend="italics">small</hi> loaf of bread per day, a small piece of meat for breakfast, and a piece of meat, and what was <hi rend="italics">called</hi> soup, for dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>About the <dateStruct value="-06-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> I was removed to <placeName key="tgn,2335231" n="1.000 1" reg="Fort Delaware, New Castle, Delaware">Fort Delaware</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>We were crowded in the hold and between decks of a steamer for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, the time occupied in the trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>I thought at the time this was terrible, but subsequent experience taught me it was only a small matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>On reaching <placeName key="tgn,2335231" n="1.000 1" reg="Fort Delaware, New Castle, Delaware">Fort Delaware</placeName> we underwent the <quote>search</quote> usual at most of the prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3395"/>What money I had I put in brown paper, which I placed in my mouth in a chew of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3396"/>I thus managed to secure it. An insufficiency of food was the chief complaint at <placeName key="tgn,2335231" n="1.000 1" reg="Fort Delaware, New Castle, Delaware">Fort Delaware</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>I did not suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/>My friends supplied me with money, and I was allowed to purchase from the sutler what I needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>As he was about to return a considerable crowd of prisoners had collected there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3403"/>The sentinel ordered them to move off, which they did. <persName n="Jones,Colonel,,,," id="n0001.0022.00248.01711" reg="nearbymention:Jones,E.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> could not move fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3404"/>The sentinel ordered him to move faster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3405"/>He replied that he was doing the best he could, he could not walk any faster, whereupon the sentinel shot him, the ball passing through the arm and lungs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>He lived about <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. He remarked to the commandant of the post: <quote>Sir, I am a murdered man &mdash; murdered for nothing &mdash; I was breaking no rule.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3407"/>The prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2335231" n="1.000 1" reg="Fort Delaware, New Castle, Delaware">Fort Delaware</placeName> were great beer drinkers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>The beer was made of molasses and water &mdash; was sold by prisoners to each other for <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> per glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/>Every few yards there was a <quote>beer stand.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>Beer was drank in the place of water &mdash; the latter article being very warm, and at times very brackish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>While at <placeName key="tgn,2335231" n="1.000 1" reg="Fort Delaware, New Castle, Delaware">Fort Delaware</placeName> we were kept on the rack by alternate hope and disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>Rumors, that never came to anything, of an immediate general exchange, were every day occurrences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>On the <dateStruct value="1864-08-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> <num value="600">six hundred</num> of us were selected and sent to <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, to be placed under the fire of our own batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3416"/>Bunks had been fixed up for us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3417"/>In the centre of the rows the lower and centre tiers of bunks were shrouded in continual night, the little light through the port holes being cut off by the upper tier of bunks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/>Here we lay in these bunks, packed away like sardines, in all <measure n="18days" type="date">eighteen days</measure>, in the hottest part of summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>In <num value="2">two</num> instances the guard placed in with us fainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3423"/>Clothes and blankets were saturated with it, and it constantly dripped from the upper to the lower bunks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3424"/>Our sufferings were aggravated by a scarcity of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>The water furnished us was condensed, and so intense was the thirst for it, that it was taken from the condenser almost boiling hot and drunk in that state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, during a rain, we were allowed on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3427"/>Several of us carried up an old, dirty <rs n="oil cloth" type="product">oil-cloth</rs>, which we held by the <num value="4">four</num> corners until nearly full of rain water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3429"/>I remember well the sensation of delight, the wild joy with which I felt the cool water about my face and going down my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, hearing that the surgeon gave his medicines in ice water, I went to him and asked for a dose of salts, which he gave me, and after it a glass of ice water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>It was strange that none of us died during this trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>I can account for it only by the fact that we were sustained by the hope every <num value="1">one</num> had of being soon exchanged and returning home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3441"/>We disembarked during the middle of the day, under a scorching sun, but yet the change from the close, and by that time, filthy hold of the ship, was delightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3469"/>These sergeants were generally kind to us, expressed their sorrow that we had so little to eat. We had a point in common with them, viz: intense hatred of their <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3470"/>Their hatred of him was equalled only by their fear of him. His treatment of them, for the least violation of orders, or infraction of discipline, was barbarous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>Nothing remarkable happened until the end of the old year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>A tolerable amount of rations was issued, and our life was pretty much the same with prison life elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3535"/>We either had to eat this or lie down and die at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>This regimen lasted <measure n="43days" type="date">forty-three days</measure>. I cannot do justice to the misery and suffering experienced by myself and seen everywhere around me during this period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>It is only <num value="1">one</num> year since, and yet I can hardly believe I really passed through such scenes as memory brings before me. Our diet soon induced scurvy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>This loathsome disease, in addition to the pangs of hunger, made life almost insupportable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>The disease <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> made its appearance in the mouth, loosening the teeth, and in many cases making the gums a mass of black, putrid flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>I have seen cases where not only the legs and arms but the back was thus affected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>Another feature of the disease was the fainting produced by very slight exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>The consequence of all this was that the prisoners died like sheep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>Whatever the immediate cause of their death, that cause was induced by starvation, and over the dead bodies of <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of those brave, true men there can be given but <num value="1">one</num> true verdict: <quote>Death by <hi rend="italics">starvation</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>Fortunately for some of us, there were a great many cats about the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>That they looked thus to me, will excite no surprise when I describe my own appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/>A flannel shirt, low in the neck, was my only under-garment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3621"/>An old overcoat, once white, was doing duty as shirt, coat and vest; part of an old handkerchief tied around my head served as a hat; breeches I had none &mdash; an antiquated pair of <rs n="red flannel" type="product">red flannel</rs> drawers endeavored, but with small success, to fill their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>I was very thin and poor and was lame, scurvy having drawn the muscles of my right leg. When I add that I was in better condition, both in flesh and dress than many of our crowd, some idea can be formed of the appearance we made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>No bread or salt was offered, yet it could be had for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>From Tuesday till Friday all that I had given me to eat was <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> ears of <hi rend="italics">musty</hi> corn and <num value="4">four</num> crackers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>During that time we were exposed to the rain, which was continued for days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>After searching my package and person, taking from me nearly everything that my captors had left me, I was assigned, with <num value="2">two</num> others, to a tent having already <num value="23">twenty-three</num> occupants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>I cannot describe the appearance of that tent and the men in it. If there is a word more comprehensive than <hi rend="italics">filthy</hi> I would use it. It would require a combination of similar adjectives to give any description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3638"/>There was given me <num value="0.5">a half</num> loaf of bread and a small rusty salt mackerel, which I was informed was for next day's rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3639"/>I declared I would not sleep in the tent, but was told there was no alternative, as the guards or patrol would shoot me if I slept outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3640"/>It was a <hi rend="italics">horrible</hi> night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3641"/>Weary, exhausted, almost heart-broken, I ate a part of my scanty loaf, and placed the remainder under my head with the fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3642"/>I soon forgot my troubles in sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3643"/>Waked in the morning and found I had been relieved of any further anxiety for my bread, as it had been taken from me by some starving individual, (a common occurrence). The mackerel was left as undesirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>A <hi rend="italics">chew</hi> of tobacco would purchase <num value="2">two</num>, so little demand was there for them &mdash; for many had no means of cooking them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>A few hours of reflection &mdash; that ever to be remembered morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3646"/>There were none there that I had ever seen, except the few acquaintances made on the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3647"/>All looked dark, dismal &mdash; and the thought I might remain there for months came nearer to making my heart sink in despair than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3648"/>I thought that must be surely the darkest hour of my existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3649"/>While thus lamenting my fate, and almost distrustful of relief, a boy near me asked what regiment I belonged to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3650"/>I began to revive a little on that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3651"/>For though the saying goes, that <quote>Misery seeks strange bed fellows,</quote> I sought for old acquaintances, and soon found them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3652"/>The surprise was mutual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3653"/>By the kindness of <persName n="Vinson,Mister,,,," id="n0001.0022.00257.01718" reg="mostcommon:Vinson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vinson</surname></persName>, I had good quarters with him, and was more comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3654"/>We had a small tent, and <hi rend="italics">only</hi> <num value="6">six</num> in it. True, we were <quote>packed like sardines</quote> at night, but we were friends, and each <num value="1">one</num> had a pride and disposition to keep as cleanly as we could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3655"/>The food allowed was as follows: In the morning, early, the men are marched by companies (each about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>) to the <quote>cook houses,</quote> and receive a small piece of boiled beef or pork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3656"/>I do not think the largest piece ever given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3657"/>would weigh <num value="3">three</num> ounces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3658"/>There is no bread given at this time, and it is a common occurrence for the men to have eaten their scanty allowance in a few mouthfuls without bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3659"/>At or near <time value="12mid">twelve o'clock, M.</time>, there is issued to each <num value="0.5">a half</num> of a small loaf of bread, (<num value="8">eight</num> ounce loaves). The men can then go to the cook-houses and receive a <hi rend="italics">pint</hi> of miserable soup.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3660"/>That is the last meal for the day. I never tasted of the soup (so called) but once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3661"/>It was revolting &mdash; I might say <hi rend="italics">revolving</hi> to my stomach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3662"/>Sometimes, in place of meat, is given salt mackerel or codfish &mdash; never of good quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3663"/>The <pb id="p.258" n="258"/>water at the <quote>Point</quote> was horrible, being strongly tinctured with copperas and decayed shells, &amp;c. It was obtained from wells in different parts of the enclosure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3664"/>Near the officers quarters' was <num value="1">one</num> pump from which a little better water was sometimes received by favored ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3665"/>This location for a prison was once condemed by a Board of Surgeons on account of the poisonous composition of the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3666"/>Many persons were greatly affected by the water, and the food given would barely sustain life &mdash; in many cases it did not &mdash; and I feel confident that money deaths were caused solely from scanty and unhealthy food, and this too by a Government that had plenty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3667"/>Whenever any complaint was made of the food or treatment, the reply would be: <quote>'Tis good enough for you, and far better than <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3668"/>I depended very little upon the food issued, as in a week after my imprisonment I received money from my friends and was enabled to purchase coffee, etc., and lived well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3669"/>Most of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> fared well, but it was by purchase rather than favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3670"/>The sutlers were most happy to receive our money, and charged more than double the market value for their supplies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3671"/>We were fortunate even thus, for there were <num value="1000">thousands</num> of that motley group that for months had not a sufficiency of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3672"/>I have seen them many times fishing out from the barrels (in which all the filth and offal of the camp is thrown) crusts of bread, potato peelings, onion tops, etc., etc.--in fact, anything from which they might find little sustenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3673"/>I had never before witnessed to what great extremity hunger would drive a human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3674"/>The discipline of the prison was very strict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3675"/>The guard was most of the time of colored troops, who, when (as they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3676"/>usually were) badly treated by their officers, would vent their rage upon the prisoners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3677"/>Much is said in the papers of the <quote><placeName reg="Dead line">Dead line</placeName>,</quote> over which so many <quote>blue coats</quote> had <quote>accidentally</quote> passed and were shot for their <quote>imprudence.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3678"/>In all prisons the penalty for passing the <quote><placeName reg="Dead line">Dead line</placeName></quote> is well known, and there can be no excuse in such attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3679"/>At <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> Confederate soldiers were shot for being at the pumps for water, which had always been permitted at all hours of night, till the self-constituted restriction of the negro guard caused several men to be severely wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3680"/>I was an eye-witness of many disgusting scenes, almost brutal on the part of the guard, towards simple and ignorant prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3681"/>That prison was said to be the best of all the <rs>Yankee</rs> prisons &mdash; if so, I am truly sorry for those that were in the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3682"/>I know not what <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.343 000000.6859	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName> was.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3687"/>The routine of prison-life at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName> was as follows: Between dawn and sunrise a <quote>reveille</quote> horn summoned us into line by companies, <num value="10">ten</num> of which constituted each division &mdash; of which I have before spoken &mdash; and here the roll was called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3688"/>This performance was hurried over with much as haste as is ascribed to certain marital ceremonies in a poem that it would be obviously improper to make a more particular allusion to; and those whose love of a nap predominates over fear of the <rs>Yankees</rs>, usually tumble in for another snooze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3689"/>About <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> the breakfasting began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3690"/>This operation consisted in the forming of the companies again into line, and introducing them under lead of their sergeants into the mess-rooms, where a slice of bread and a piece of pork or beef &mdash; lean in the former and fat in the latter being contraband of war &mdash; were placed at intervals of about <measure n="20inches" type="distance">twenty inches</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3691"/>The meat was usually about <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> ounces in weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>These we seized upon, no <num value="1">one</num> being allowed to touch a piece, however, until the whole company entered, and each man was in position opposite his ration (universally pronounced <hi rend="italics">raytion</hi>, among our enemies, as it is almost as generally called with the <quote>a</quote> short among ourselves, symbolical, you observe, of the <hi rend="italics">shortness</hi> of provant in Dixie). This over, a detail of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> men from each company &mdash; made at morning roll-call &mdash; formed themselves into squads for the cleansing of the camp; an operation which the <rs>Yankees</rs> everywhere attend to with more diligence than ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3693"/>The men then busied themselves with the numberless occupations which the fertility of American genius suggests, of which I will have something to say hereafter, until dinner-time, when they were again carried to the mess-houses, where another slice of bread, and rather oven, half-pint of watery slop, by courtesy called <quote>soup,</quote> greeted the eyes of such ostrich-stomached animals as could find comfort in that substitute for nourishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3694"/>About sunset, at the winding of another horn, the roll was again called, to be sure that no <num value="1">one</num> had <quote>flanked out,</quote> and, about an hour after, came <quote>taps;</quote> after which all were required to remain in their quarters and keep silent.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>An air of truthfulness is given to this production by a number of affidavits of Confederate prisoners, which made many a Confederate stare and laugh to read.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>An additional refinement of cruelty was the regulation which always obtained at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, and which I believe was peculiar to the prison, under which the <name>Yanks</name> stole from us any bed-clothing we might possess, <hi rend="italics">beyond <num value="1">one</num> blanket</hi>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3782"/>This department was constantly undergoing changes, and I suspect that the whole system was intended as part of the education of the young doctors assigned to us, for as soon as they learned to distinguish between quinine and magnesia they were removed to another field of labor.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>These ward physicians treated the simplest cases in their patients' barrack, and transferred the more dangerous ones to the hospitals, of which there were <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12">twelve</num>, capable of accommodating about <num value="80">eighty</num> patients each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>Here every arrangement was made that <hi rend="italics">carpenters</hi> could make to insure the patients against unnecessary mortality, and, indeed, a <hi rend="italics">system</hi> was professed which would have delighted the heart of a Sister of Charity; but, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>the practice was quite another thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3787"/>The most scandalous neglect prevailed even in so simple a matter as providing food for the sick, and I do not doubt that many of those who died perished from actual starvation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <rs>Petersburg</rs> prisoners having become so sick as to be sent to the hospital, he complained to his friends who visited him that he could get nothing to eat, and was dying in consequence, when they made application for leave to buy him some potatoes and roast them for him. <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> S. not being consulted, the request was granted, and when, a few hours afterwards, the roasted potatoes <pb id="p.267" n="267"/>were brought in, the poor invalids on the neighboring cots crawled from their beds and begged the peelings to satisfy the hunger that was gnawing them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>When complaint was made of this brutality to the sick, there was always a convenient official excuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3790"/>Sometimes the fault would be that a lazy doctor would not make out his provision return in time, in which case his whole ward must go without food, or with an inadequate supply, till the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3794"/>There would be and is much excuse .for such deficiencies in the <rs>South</rs>--and this is a matter which the <rs>Yankees</rs> studiously ignore &mdash; inasmuch as the blockade renders it impossible to procure any luxuries even for our own sick, and curtails and renders enormously expensive the supply of drugs of the simplest kind, providing they are exotics; but in a nation whose boast it is that they do not feel the war, with the world open to them and supplies of all sorts wonderfully abundant, it is simply infamous to starve the sick as they did there, and equally discreditable to deny them medicines &mdash; indispensable according to Esculapian traditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3795"/>The result of the ignorance of the doctors, and the sparseness of these supplies, was soon apparent in the shocking mortality of this camp, notwithstanding the healthfulness claimed for the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>It has not been uncommon here for our half-clothed, half-fed Confederates at the barracks to be ordered about in the coarsest and roughest manner by their inferiors, and to be knocked on the head with sticks, or to be stuck with bayonets, for the slightest offences; and, sometimes (for no crime whatever), men have been shot at or cruelly murdered by sentinels, who bore malice, and justified themselves upon the plea that they were trying to prevent escapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>Sick men have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>kept at the barracks until perfectly emaciated from diarrhea, without the necessary sick vessels, and have been obliged to stagger, through the quarters, to the out-house on the bank of the river, with filth streaming upon their legs; and then, unable to help themselves, they have fallen upon the pathway, and have been found dead in the morning &mdash; victims of cruel neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>and without either furnishing them with medicine or meat, have left them to die.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3962"/>I have known men punished thus, until they would grow so deathly sick that they would vomit all over themselves, their heads fall forward and almost every sign of life become extinct; the ends of their thumbs would burst open; a surgeon standing by would feel their pulse and say he thought they could stand it a little longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3963"/>Sometimes he would say they had better be cut down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> was heard to whisper at night, or the least ray of light was seen, the guard would fire into the barracks at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>In each barrack there was only <num value="2">two</num> stoves to <num value="200">two hundred</num> men, and for a stove to warm <num value="100">one hundred</num> men, it was frequently red hot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion as the flag which floated in front of the commandant's quarters was being hoisted the rope broke, letting the flag fall, which being seen by the regiment to which I belonged (<orgName type="regiment" key="2KYCav">second Kentucky cavalry</orgName>), a terrific yell was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>This so incensed the <rs>Yankees</rs> that a certain valiant <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, Gaffeny by name, marched his company, some <num value="80">eighty</num> strong, up to our barracks; had the regiment formed and went up and down the line kicking the men, and swearing that his company, about <num value="80">eighty</num> strong, could whip the whole camp of about <num value="5000">five thousand</num>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/><pb id="p.278" n="278"/></p> 
<p>Our whole camp was rearranged; the parapet guard were ordered not to fire unless some <num value="1">one</num> tried to escape; a police guard was placed in the prison to do all the devilment which the infernally fertile mind of <persName n="Sponable,Captain,,,," id="n0001.0022.00278.01807" reg="nearbymention:Sponable,Webb,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Sponable</surname></persName> could invent; starvation was carried on quite systematically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>Our rations for breakfast consisted of <num value="5">five</num> ounces of bread and <num value="6">six</num> ounces of fresh beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3981"/>As the rations for <num value="200">two hundred</num> men were boiled in a <num value="60">sixty</num>-gallon kettle, it was necessary in order to cook it done, to boil it to shreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3982"/>In fact there was no more nutritious matter in it than in an old dish cloth, for dinner <num value="1">one</num> pint bean soup and <num value="5">five</num> ounces of bread, <hi rend="italics">this was our living</hi>. This was not regularly issued, for the slightest offence would cause the captain's direful anger to be aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>and as he would make most by stopping our rations this was quite a favorite punishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>His mildest punishment was to get a scantling <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> wide, shave it down until it was only half inch thick on top and put legs about <measure n="17feet" type="distance">seventeen feet</measure> long to it. (This horse, when finished, was called <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00278.01808" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,J.,H.,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>). Now, for the slight offence of looking at a guard the boys have been placed on this horse for hours, their feet hanging down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>Sometimes the <name>Yanks</name> would laugh and say, I will give you a pair of spurs, which was a bucket of sand tied to each foot; also to set the boys astraddle the roof of a dog house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>I have seen men who had been left in this condition until the skin and flesh was cut nearly to the bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>Men in the winter would get so cold that they would fall off. When warmed they were put back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>Another slight punishment was to saw a barrel in <num value="2">two</num>, cut a hole in <num value="1">one</num> end so as to allow a man's head to go through, but leave the barrel around his shoulders, then march him in the sun until the rays reflected from the barrel would swell his head almost twice its natural size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>I have seen men's faces peel all over from this innocent amusement of the guards.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3990"/>If the least sign of water or spit was seen on the floor the order was, <quote>Come, go to the horse or point for grub,</quote> which was to stand with the legs perfectly straight, reach over, and touch the ground with the fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3991"/>If the legs were bent in the least, a guard was present with a paddle, which he well knew how to use. When the guards grew weary of this punishment, another was to make the men pull down their pants and sit, with nothing under them, on the snow and frozen ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3992"/>I have known men to be kept sitting until you could see their prints for some days afterwards in the snow and ice. When they got weary of this, they commenced whipping, making the men lay on a barrel, and using their belts, which had a leaden clasp with sharp edge, the belt would often gather wind so as to turn the clasp edgeways; every lick inflicted thus cut entirely through the skin.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3993"/>If more than <num value="5">five</num> men were seen together, or if anyone was heard to whisper or spit upon the floor, it was certain to be followed by <num value="1">one</num> of these punishments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3994"/>Frequently men sick in barracks were delirious; sometimes <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> in a barrack were crazy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3995"/>These <pb id="p.279" n="279"/>were the cause of a whole barrack of men being mounted on a horse or punished in other ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3996"/>Sometimes a guard would come in, and swear he heard some <num value="1">one</num> whispering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3997"/>He would make <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> men get up, with nothing but their underclothes to protect them against a climate where the thermometer stood <num value="20">twenty</num> degrees below zero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>Shooting about this time was less frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>The fiends were satisfied with such punishment as would most likely end in death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>At this period we were reinforced by the prisoners captured in front of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>They, after being cooped up in the cars <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>, were nearly dead for water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/>The hydrants were frozen up, and we had eaten all the snow inside the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4003"/>The poor fellows would lay down at or as close to the dead-line as possible, and reach their arm through and pull the snow to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> of the guards standing <num value="25">twenty-five</num> steps from a prisoner thus engaged shoot at him <num value="3">three</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>Fortunately the police guards were armed with pistols; had it been a rifle the poor fellow must have died the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>At <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> all the formidable nomenclature and enginery of prison discipline were in vogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>We had our <quote><hi rend="italics">dead line</hi></quote> within and up some distance from the tall fence which formed <quote>the pen,</quote> <pb id="p.280" n="280"/>which line, if a prisoner crossed, the guard, posted on a plank walk near the top of the fence, was under orders to fire upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>At this, as at all other Federal prisons, <hi rend="italics">the rations</hi> of prisoners were at sundry times reduced below the amount confessedly indispensable to the maintenance of a man in full health &mdash; in retaliation as was alleged for the starvation of Federal prisoners in Confederate prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>During my stay on the <rs type="place">Island</rs>, the war being substantially over, the <hi rend="italics">discipline</hi> and management were more liberal, and the ration, though meagre, larger than it had been; the sutler, too, was open, and the few prisoners fortunate enough to obtain money lived reasonally well, but the majority still suffered from lack of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>After being an inmate of the pen for a few days and observing the really pitiful hunger and destitution, I organized a system of collection from the messes who had money, and patronized the sutler and distribution among the less favored who starved on the prison ration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>The treatment of prisoners in Northern prisons is a subject that has received little attention from the press, and consequently is little understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>The charges of cruelty to prisoners, made with such confidence against the <rs>South</rs>, on a recent occasion, for the purpose of political aggrandizement, and which recalls the old story of <quote>Stop thief,</quote> where the thief bawled the loudest, makes it necessary in common justice to ventilate the <rs>Northern</rs> prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>The Federal soldier returning home to a land of plenty, his necessities anticipated by benevolent associations, his spirits cheered by the sympathy of a grateful people, and his services rewarded with bounties and pensions by a generous Government, found leisure and encouragement to recount his sufferings and privations to eager listeners, and the air was filled with cries for vengeance on his jailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>But the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier returning home from a Northern prison to a land of famine, found his substance wasted and his energies enfeebled; disfranchised and beggared, he forgot <pb id="p.282" n="282"/>his past sufferings in his present wretchedness; he had neither the time to lament, nor the inclination to talk about his treatment in prison; he was thankful if his health permitted him to labor for those dearer to him than himself, and for the cripple and the invalid there was no resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>There was no lack of sympathy, but his friends were the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>Thus it happened that the cruelty practised in Northern prisons never came to light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>The severity of the weather caused cleanliness of person and clothing to be disregarded by some, and as a consequence scarcely a man escaped the itch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>This number (<num value="1945">1,945</num>) includes those who were killed by the sentinels &mdash; the killed not being classified by the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4098"/>More than <num value="0.5">fifty per cent.</num> of the released were of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>The balance were principally Missourians, captured during <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00284.01847" reg="mostcommon:Price,Samuel,,,:1"><surname>Price</surname></persName>'s last raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>These claimed to be Union men, and having proved their loyalty to the satisfaction of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, were released by his order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>The prisoners transferred were officers originally brought to <placeName reg="Rock Island, Rock Island, Illinois" key="tgn,7014353">Rock Island</placeName>, but afterwards sent to <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> or other military prisons.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4102"/>In <dateStruct value="1864-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the sentinels on the parapet commenced firing at the prisoners and into the barracks, and this practice continued <pb id="p.285" n="285"/>while I remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/>I am ignorant as to the orders the sentinels received, but I know that the firing was indiscriminate, and apparently the mere caprice of the sentinels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>Going to the sinks at night was a most dangerous undertaking, for they were now built on the <quote>dead line,</quote> and lamps with reflectors were fastened to the plank fence &mdash; the sentinel above being unseen, while the man approaching the sink was in full view of the sentinel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>Frequently they would halt a prisoner and make him take off his pants in the street, and then order him to come to the sink in his drawers, (if he had any). I have heard the cocking of a gun presented at myself while going to the sink at night, but by jumping into an alley between the barracks I saved myself the exercise of walking to the sink in my drawers or from receiving the contents of the gun. I find this entry in my diary on <dateStruct value="1864-06-10"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="10">10</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>: <quote>Attacked with diarrrhoea in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>Afraid to go near the sink.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>I cannot say that the sentinels had positive orders to shoot on each occasion, but that they received encouragement to do so, and were relieved of all responsibility for such acts, is certain from the following orders, which were publicly promulgated to the orderlies of barracks by the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>, to wit:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/><dateStruct value="1864-05-12"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="12">12</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.--Ordered, that no prisoner be out of his barracks after <quote>taps.</quote></p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>It was noticed and discussed among the prisoners, that the shooting was most violent immediately after a Confederate success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>I noted some cases that came under my own observation, but by no means a complete list; in fact, the prisoners became so accustomed to the firing from the parapet, that unless it occurred near his side of the prison, a man would take little notice of it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>I had the honor to be appointed by that organization to ascertain the needs of the prisoners, to distribute clothing, money, etc., as they might require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>I had formerly lived at <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName>, where I studied my profession, but then (as now) I resided at this place, <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles distant</distance> from <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName></placeName>, where I have resided for nearly <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure>, and was well known at <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>As soon as appointed I journeyed to that delightful paradise for Confederate prisoners (according to <persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00294.01886" reg="mostcommon:Walker,J.,G.,,:3"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>, <persName n="Tracy,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00294.01887" reg="mostcommon:Tracy,Prescott,,,:1"><surname>Tracy</surname></persName> and <persName n="Platt,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00294.01888" reg="mostcommon:Platt,nomatch:0"><surname>Platt</surname></persName>), and stated the object of my visit to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, and asked to be permitted to go through the prison in order to ascertain the wants of the prisoners, with the request that I might distribute necessary blankets, clothing, money, medicines, etc.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>He treated me with consideration and kindness, and informed me that they were very destitute of clothing and blankets; that not <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of them had even a single blanket; and that many were nearly naked, the most of them having been captured during the hot summer months with no other than thin cotton clothes, which in most instances were in tatters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>Yet he stated that he could not allow me to enter the prison gate or administer relief, as an order of tile <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> rendered him powerless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>I then asked him to telegraph the facts to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and ask a revocation or modification of the order, which he did; and <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> were thus consumed by me in a fruitless endeavor <pb id="p.295" n="295"/>to procure the poor privilege of carrying out the designs of the good <rs>Samaritans</rs> at <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> who were seeking to alleviate in a measure the wants of the poor sufferers, who were there dying off like rotten sheep from cold and exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>The officer in command was an army officer, and his heart nearly bled for those poor sufferers; and I know he did all in his power to aid me, but his efforts were fruitless to assist me to put a single coat on the back of a sufferer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>The brutal <rs>Stanton</rs> was inexorable to all my entreaties, and turned a deaf ear to the tale of their sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>The only proposition that could be entertained was this: If I would fetch clothing only of a gray color (Confederate uniforms) I could place it in the hands of some under-strappers of the <hi rend="italics">loyal persuasion</hi>, as well as such moneys as I might wish to leave in the same hands, and they would distribute the same as they liked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>This could not be allowed to be done by the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs>, but must be done by <num value="1">one</num> of the <hi rend="italics">loyal</hi> (?) gentry, who I became satisfied would absorb it before any poor Confederate soldier would even catch a glimse at its shadow; and I was actually forced to give the matter up in despair.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>The nearest I could get to the poor skeletons confined in that prison, was a tower built by some speculator in an adjoining field across the way from the prison pen, for which privilege a money consideration was exacted and paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>On taking a position upon this tower what a sight of misery and squalor was presented!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>My heart was made sick, and I blushed for my country &mdash; more because of the inhumanity there depicted.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>Sir &mdash; I beg herewith (after having carefully gone through the various documents in my possession pertaining to the matter) to forward you the following statistics and facts of the mortality of the <rs>Rebel</rs> prisoners in the <rs>Northern</rs> prisons, more particularly at that of <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira, New York</placeName>, where I served as <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs> for many months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>I found, on commencement of my duties at <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName>, about <num value="11000">11,000</num> Rebel prisoners, fully <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of whom were under medical treatment for diseases principally owing to an improper diet, a want of clothing, necessary shelter and bad sur-sounding; the diseases were consequently of the following nature: Scurvy, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and the various branches of typhoid, all superinduced by the causes, more or less, aforementioned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>The winter of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">5</year></dateStruct> was an unusually severe and rigid <num value="1">one</num>, and the prisoners arriving from the <rs>Southern States</rs> during this season were mostly old men and lads, clothed in attire suitable only to the genial climate of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>I need not state to you that this alone was ample cause for an unusual mortality amongst them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>The surroundings were of the following nature, viz: narrow, confined limits, but a few acres of ground in extent, and through which slowly flowed a turbid stream of water, carrying along with it all the excremental filth and debris of the camp; this stream of water, horrible to relate, was the only source of supply, for an extended period, that the prisoners could possibly use for the purpose of ablution, and to slake their thirst from day to day; the tents and other shelter allotted to the camp at <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName> were insufficient, and crowded to the utmost extent &mdash; hence, small pox and other skin diseases raged through the camp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4326"/>Here I may note that, owing to a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> from the <rs>Government</rs> to vaccinate the prisoners, my opportunities were ample to observe the effects of spurious and diseased matter, and there is no doubt in my mind but that syphilis was engrafted in many instances; ugly and horrible ulcers and eruptions of a characteristic nature were, alas, too frequent and obvious to be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4327"/>Small pox cases were crowded in such a manner that it was a matter of impossibility for the surgeon to treat his patients individually; they actually laid so adjacent that the simple movement of <num value="1">one</num> of them would cause his neighbor to cry out in agony of pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4328"/>The confluent and malignant type prevailed to such an extent, and of such a nature, that the body would frequently be found <num value="1">one</num> continuous scab.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4329"/>The diet and other allowances by the <rs>Government</rs> for the use of the prisoners were ample, yet the poor unfortunates were allowed <pb id="p.297" n="297"/>to starve; but why, is a query which I will allow your readers to infer, and to draw conclusions therefrom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4330"/>Out of the number of prisoners, as before mentioned, over <num value="3000">three thousand</num> of them now lay buried in the cemetery located near the camp for that purpose; a mortality equal, if not greater than that of any prison in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4331"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.374 000000.7479	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.374 000000.7479	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, as I am well informed by brother officers who endured confinement there, as well as by the records at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the mortality was <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> out of say about <measure n="40000" type="prisoners">forty thousand prisoners</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>With our prisoners at <placeName reg="Elmira, Chemung, New York" key="tgn,7014109">Elmira</placeName>, no such necessity should honestly have existed, as our Government had actually, as I have stated, most bountifully made provision for the wants of all detained, both of officers and men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>I do not say that all prisoners at the <rs>North</rs> suffered and endured the terrors and the cupidity of venal sub-officials; on the contrary, at the camps in the harbor of <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">New York</placeName>, and at <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, and at other camps where my official duties from time to time have called me, the prisoners in all respects have fared as our Government intended and designated they should.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>Our Government allowed the prisoners of war the following rations: <num value="12">Twelve</num> ounces of pork or bacon, or <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of salt or fresh beef; <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="6">six</num> ounces of soft bread or flour, or <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> of <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>; and to every <num value="100">one hundred</num> rations, <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure> of beans or peas and <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of rice or hominy, <measure n="10l." type="pounds"><num value="10">ten</num> pounds</measure> of green coffee or <measure n="5l." type="pounds"><num value="5">five</num> pounds</measure> of roasted ditto, or <measure n="1l." type="pounds"><num value="1">one</num> pound</measure> <num value="8">eight</num> ounces of tea, <measure n="15l." type="pounds"><num value="15">fifteen</num> pounds</measure> of sugar, <num value="4">four</num> quarts of vinegar, <measure n="30l." type="pounds"><num value="30">thirty</num> pounds</measure> of potatoes, and if fresh potatoes could not be obtained, canned vegetables were allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>Prisoners of war will receive for subsistence <num value="1">one</num> ration each, without regard to rank; their private property shall be duly respected, and each shall be treated with regard to his rank, and the wounded are to be treated with the same care as the wounded of our army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>By the terms of that cartel it is stipulated that all prisoners of war hereafter taken shall be discharged on parole until exchanged.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>Scarcely had the cartel been signed when the military authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> commenced a practice changing the character of the war from such as becomes civilized nations into a campaign of indiscriminate robbery and murder.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>Some of the military authorities of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> seem to suppose that their end will be better attained by a savage war, in which no quarter is to be given and no age or sex to be spared, than by such hostilities as are alone recognized to be lawful in modern times.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>Under these circumstances this Government has issued the accompanying <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs>, which I am directed by the <rs>President</rs> to transmit to you, recognizing <persName n="Pope,Major-General,,,," id="n0001.0022.00300.01904" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:2"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> and his commissioned officers to be in a position which they have chosen for themselves &mdash; that of robbers and murderers, and not that of public enemies, entitled, if captured, to be treated as prisoners of war.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>While the <rs>President</rs> considers that the facts referred to would justify a refusal on our part to execute the cartel, by which we have agreed to liberate an excess of prisoners of war in our hands, a sacred regard for plighted faith, which shrinks from the semblance of breaking a promise, precludes a resort to such an extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>Nor is it his desire to extend to any other forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the punishment merited by <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n0001.0022.00300.01906" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> and such commissioned officers as choose to participate in the execution of his infamous orders.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4397"/>Sir &mdash; I have the honor to submit the accompanying correspondence between the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Agent of Exchange">Agent of Exchange</rs> and myself:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4398"/>I have selected from the mass of correspondence, such letters as relate to matters of general interest, and especially to the subjects of controversy between us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4399"/><num value="1">1</num>. Papers from <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="12">twelve</num>, inclusive, relate the arrest and detention of non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4400"/>The Federal authorities have persistently refused to observe any reciprocal rule as to such parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4401"/>Their military commanders seem to have been permitted to make arrests of non-combatants without regard to their age, sex or situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4402"/>After arrest, they have been thrown into prison and there indefinitely retained, in most cases, without charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4403"/>I have persistently contended that the whole subject of their capture of non-combatants, should be determined by rule, and not by arbitrary practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>This reasonable proposal, not receiving the assent of the enemy, the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities have been forced, in some instances, to retain Federal non-combatants as a measure of retaliation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4405"/><num value="2">2</num>. Papers from <num value="13">thirteen</num> to <num value="16">sixteen</num>, inclusive, relate to the retention of exchanged and unexchanged officers and men. There are officers and men now in Federal prisons, who have been there ever since the adoption of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>I have brought to the attention of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities again and again the names of some of the parties who were confined in violation of the exchange agreements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4407"/>In some cases, after long delay, the parties were released.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4408"/>Others, however, are still languishing in confinement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4409"/><num value="3">3</num>. Papers from <num value="17">seventeen</num> to <num value="40">forty</num>, inclusive, relate to the general orders of the enemy and their connection with declarations of exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>So anxioushas the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> been to remove all obstacles to a general exchange of prisoners, that when the computation and adjustment of paroles was made a subject of difficulty by the enemy, we promptly agreed to determine the whole matter in accordance with the general orders, issued at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>This very liberal proposition has not been accepted by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, I have, however, by virtue of the provisions of the cartel, proceeded to make declarations of exchange, upon the basis of those general orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>In those declarations of exchange, I have not exceeded the valid paroles, which are on file in my office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>The reply of the <rs>Federal</rs> agent to my letter of <dateStruct value="1863-10-31"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="31">31st</day>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, was so personally offensive, that I was compelled to return it to him without any answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4416"/><num value="5">5</num>. Papers from <num value="48">forty-eight</num> to <num value="57">fifty-seven</num>, inclusive, relate to the detention of surgeons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>Before the date of the cartel, surgeons were unconditionally released after capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>That rule was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> adopted by the <rs>Confederate</rs> commanders, and was subsequently followed by the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>This caused retaliation on our part, in return, and surgeons were afterwards held in captivity on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>In this instance, the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities proved that they were ready to sacrifice their own medical officers in an endeavour to secure the release of a felon in no way connected with their medical service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>By agreement made with the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Agent of Exchange">Agent of Exchange</rs>, all such who were captured before <dateStruct value="1862-12-10"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="10">10th</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, were declared exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>In spite of that agreement, some of our pilots and sea captains were kept in confinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4427"/>The correspondence will fully show the refusal of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to adopt any fair and reciprocal rule, as to the further exchange of such persons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4428"/><num value="7">7</num>. Papers numbered <num value="64">sixty-four</num> and <num value="65">sixty-five</num>, show the pretensions of the enemy as to such persons as have been tried under the laws of a sovereign State for offences against the same.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/><num value="8">8</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4430"/>It seems there are <num value="2">two</num> commissioners of exchange on the part of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4431"/>How far the authority of each extends, or how far <num value="1">one</num> is subordinate to the other, has not as yet clearly appeared.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4439"/>Sir &mdash; The best mode of arranging all questions relating to exchange of officers, is to revoke, formally or informally, the offensive proclamation relating to our officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4440"/>I simply ask that you say, by authority, that such proclamation is revoked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4441"/>The spirit of that proclamation was the infliction of personal indignities upon our officers, and as long as it remains unrepealed, it can be at any moment put in force by your authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4442"/>What assurance have we that it will not be?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4443"/>I earnestly desire a return to the cartel in all matters pertaining to officers, and until such be the case, and uniformity of rule be thereby established, our exchanges of officers must be special.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4444"/>Some of our officers, paroled at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, were subsequently placed in close confinement, and are now so held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4445"/>If, hereafter, we parole any of your officers, such paroles will be offset against any which you may possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4446"/>At present the exchanges will be confined to such equivalents as are held in confinement on either side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4447"/>I hope you will soon be able to remove all difficulties about officers by the revocation I have mentioned.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4455"/>That refusal is not only a flagrant breach of the cartel, but can be supported by no rule of reciprocity or equity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4456"/>It is utterly useless to argue any such matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4457"/>I assure you that not <num value="1">one</num> officer of any grade will be delivered to you until you change your purpose in that respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4458"/>You have charged us with breaking the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4459"/>With what sort of justice can that allegation be supported, when you delivered only a few days ago over <num value="90">ninety</num> officers, most of whom had been forced to languish and suffer in prisons for months before we were compelled by that and other reasons to issue the retaliatory order of which you complain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4460"/>Those <num value="90">ninety</num>-odd are not <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of those whom you unjustly hold in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/>On the other hand, I defy you to name the case of <num value="1">one</num> who is confined by us, whom our agreement has declared exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4462"/>Is it your idea that we are to be bound by every strictness of the cartel, while you are at liberty to violate it for months, and that, too, not only in a few instances, but in hundreds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4463"/>You know that our refusal to parole officers, was a matter exclusively of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/>It was based only upon your refusal to observe the requirements of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>All that you had to do to remove the obnoxious measure of retaliation, was to observe the provisions of the cartel and redress the wrongs which had been perpetrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>Your last resolution, if persisted in, settles the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>You need not send any officers to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> with the expectation of getting an equivalent in officers, so long as you refuse to deliver any for those whom we have released on parole in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>Sir &mdash; Your communication of the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num> contests my declaration of exchanges of officers made on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>You say <quote>the cartel provides for the exchange of equal ranks, until such are exhausted, and then for equivalents.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/>If you had been at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, where you could have seen the cartel, instead of New York, from which your letter is dated, you would have written <pb id="p.307" n="307"/>no such paragraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4475"/>There is nothing in the cartel which contains any such doctrine, or which favors it. Every provision is against it. Your own and my practice have been opposed to it. I again say to you what I have already stated in my communication of the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th instant</day></dateStruct>, that your assent is not needed to the declared exchange, and I shall not notify the officers, whom I have declared exchanged, as you request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>I have allowed you to declare exchanges when the number of prisoners in our hands has been the greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>This has been the case from the day when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met in the fall of last year, to the capture at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4478"/>Now, when you have scarcely received official advices of your superiority in prisoners, you boast of the fact, and declare that I cannot give an equivalent for the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> I have declared exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4479"/>The point you make is worth nothing, even as you have stated it. You know we have no lieutenant-generals or major-generals of yours in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4480"/>For that reason I have declared them exchanged in privates or inferior officers at your election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4481"/>I had the right, under the cartel, to make the choice myself, but I preferred that you should do it, and therefore, I gave you the notification which I did. If, at any time, you present officers for exchange who have been paroled, and we have no officers of similar rank on parole, you can declare their exchange in privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>If, at this time, you have any officers of the rank I have declared exchanged, or of any other rank, or if you have any particular organization of privates or non-commissioned officers whom you wish exchanged, you have only to state such fact and your selection will be approved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4483"/>If you hold the paroles of our officers of any rank as you state, you have only to present them, and whatever is in our hands, whether on parole or in captivity, will be freely given in exchange for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4484"/>You say you have again and again invited me to a return to the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>Now that our official connection is being terminated, I say to you in the fear of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>--and I appeal to Him for the truth of the declaration &mdash; that there has been no single moment, from the time when we were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> brought together in connection with the matter of exchange to the present hour, during which there has not been an open and notorious violation of the cartel by your authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>Officers and men, numbering over hundreds, have been, during your whole connection with the cartel, kept in cruel confinement, sometimes in irons, or doomed to cells, without charges or trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4487"/>They are in prison now, unless <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in His mercy, has released them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4488"/>In our parting moments, let me do you the justice to say that I do not believe it is so much your fault as that of your authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4489"/>Nay more, I believe your removal from your position has been owing to the personal efforts you have made for a faithful observance, not only of the cartel, but of humanity in the conduct of the war.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4490"/>Again and again have I importuned you to tell me of <num value="1">one</num> officer or man now held in confinement by us, who was declared exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4493"/>On the other hand, I appeal to your own records for the cases where your reports have shown that our officers and men have been held for long months and even years in violation of the cartel and our agreements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4505"/>According to the terms of this cartel all captures must be reduced to actual possession, and all prisoners of war must be delivered at the places designated, there to be exchanged or paroled until exchange can be effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4506"/>The only exception allowed is the case of commanders of <num value="2">two</num> opposing armies, who were authorized to exchange prisoners or to release them on parole at other points mutually agreed upon by said commanders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4507"/><num value="2">2</num>. It is understood that captured officers and men have been paroled and released in the field by others than commanders of opposing armies, and that the sick and wounded in hospitals have been so paroled and released in order to avoid guarding and removing them, which in many cases would have been impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>Such paroles are in violation of general orders and the stipulations of the cartel, and are null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/>They are not regarded by the enemy, and will not be respected by the armies of the <rs>United</rs> <pb id="p.309" n="309"/>States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4510"/>Any officer or soldier who gives such parole will be returned to duty without exchange, and, moreover, will be punished for disobedience of orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4511"/>It is the duty of the captor to guard his prisoners, and if through necessity or choice he fails to do this, it is the duty of the prisoner to return to the service of his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4512"/>He cannot avoid this duty by giving an unauthorized military parole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4513"/><num value="3">3</num>. A military parole not to serve until exchanged must not be confounded with a parole of honor to do or not to do a particular thing not inconsistent with the duty of a soldier; thus a prisoner of war actually held by the enemy may, in order to obtain exemption from a close guard or confinement, pledge his parole of honor that he will make no attempt at escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4514"/>Such pledges are binding upon the individuals giving them; but they should seldom be given or received, for it is the duty of a prisoner to escape if able to do so. Any pledge or parole extorted from a prisoner by ill usage is not binding.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4519"/>It is very manifest that that order was issued for the purpose of embarrassing <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0001.0022.00309.01952" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> with the guarding and feeding of the prisoners, amounting to several <num value="1000">thousand</num>, then in our hands; and in consequence of the order, information of which reached us immediately, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0001.0022.00309.01953" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> sent a flag of truce to <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00309.01954" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> on the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, after the close of the battle, with a proposition to exchange prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>The latter declined the proposition, alleging a want of authority to make the exchange, or, from his own views of policy, he positively declined to entertain the proposition; I am not certain which.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>According to the laws of war in the earliest ages a captive in war forfeited his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>Subsequently, in the cause of humanity, the penalty of death was commuted to slavery for life; and this continued to be a law of war for more than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the <orgName n="Christian Era" type="newspaper">Christian era</orgName>, notwithstanding it has been so often said that slavery disappeared in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> before the spirit of Christianity; in fact, it was the vast number of captives in war reduced to slavery from among the <name>Sclavi</name> or Sclavonians, in the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> century, under that bulwark of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, <persName><foreName>Charlemagne</foreName></persName>, that caused the distinctive and modern appellation of <quote>slaves</quote> to be applied to all those held to involuntary servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>In the age of chivalry, when knights-errant, <pb id="p.310" n="310"/>and more especially the <name>Crusaders</name>, wanted money more than they did slaves, they sold their slaves their freedom; and the practice of releasing prisoners for a ransom was resorted to, and continued to be a law of war until a comparatively modern date, when, with the growth of regular armies, the practice of releasing prisoners on parole became a recognized rule of civilized warfare among <name>Christian</name> nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>It has never, however, been a law of war that the obligation of a prisoner to observe his parole depends upon the assent of his own Government; but, on the contrary, the right of a prisoner to obtain his release from captivity by giving his parole of honor not to serve against his captors until exchanged or otherwise released is derived from the fact that by his captivity he is placed beyond the protection of his Government, and therefore has the right to provide for his own safety by giving the requisite pledge, and all civilized nations recognize the binding force of that pledge or parole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>The rule is laid down by Vattel, <ref n="page 414">pp. 414</ref> and <ref n="page 415">415</ref>, as follows:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/> Individuals, whether belonging to the army or not, who happen singly to fall in with the enemy are, by the urgent necessity of the circumstance, left to their own discretion, and may, so far as concerns their own persons, do everything which a commander might do with respect to himself and the troops under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>If, therefore, in consequence of the situation in which they are involved, they make any promise, such promise (provided it do not extend to matters which can never lie within the sphere of a private individual) is valid and obligatory, as being made with competent powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>For, when a subject can neither receive his sovereign's orders nor enjoy his protection, he resumes his natural rights, and is to provide for his own safety by any just and honorable means in his power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>Hence, if that individual has promised a sum for his <hi rend="italics">ransom</hi>, the sovereign, so far from having the power to discharge him from his promise, should oblige him to fulfil it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/>The good of the <rs>State</rs> requires that faith should be kept on such occasions, and that subjects should have this mode of saving their lives or recovering their liberty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>Thus, a prisoner who is released on his parole is bound to observe it with scrupulous punctuality, nor has the sovereign a right to oppose such observance of his engagement; for had not the prisoner thus given his parole he would not have been released.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>The same doctrine is laid down by publicists generally.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>The question of exchange of prisoners is a matter for agreement between the opposing powers, but the question of the parole is not. The paroles stipulated for in the cartel of <dateStruct value="1862-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, were paroles with a view to subsequent exchange, and the stipulation did not create the right of a prisoner of war to be released from captivity on his parole, that existed prior to and independent of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>It existed by virtue of a <quote>higher law</quote> [if I may be permitted to use a phrase so much in vogue in former times among those who now attach so much importance to unwavering fidelity to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <pb id="p.311" n="311"/>in their view of it], than an order from the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>--the law of self-preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>If I had found myself at any time during the war a prisoner in the hands of the enemy, about to be dragged to a Northern prison, where I am sure confinement for a very short time would have killed me or run me mad, and my captors had been humane enough to release me on my parole of honor not to serve again until exchanged, I am sure I would have thought my Government more barbarous than the enemy if it had required of me a violation of my parole and a return to duty without exchange; but I feel confident no such dishonor would ever have been required of me by that Government for I do know that the paroles of some of my own men, captured at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="1862-05-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> more than <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> before the cartel was adopted, and for special reasons paroled within a week of their capture, were respected, and they were regularly exchanged.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>and why did he prefer that they should be confined in prisons in the <rs>South</rs>--<quote>prison pens,</quote> as Northern Republicans are pleased to call them &mdash; rather than that they should be sent to their own homes on parole, there to remain in comfort until duly exchanged, if it was not to embarrass the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> with the custody and support of them, regardless of any consideration for their health or their lives?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>If he did not think proper to exchange Confederate prisoners in his hands for them he could have refused to do so; and certainly their presence at their own homes could have done no harm to his cause; most assuredly not more than their confinement in a prison, in a climate to which they were unaccustomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>If the rule asserted in his order is among the laws and usages of war, then it must follow that if <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0001.0022.00311.01957" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had not been able to guard or feed the prisoners in his hands he would have had the right to resort to that dread alternative to which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0001.0022.00311.01958" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> resorted in <placeName reg="Egypt, Chickasaw, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056358">Egypt</placeName> when he found the paroles granted by him not respected, and destroy the prisoners in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>If any of the prisoners brought from <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, or subsequently captured, lost their lives at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.368 000000.7355	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.368 000000.7355	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>, or any other Southern prison, is it not palpable that the responsibility for their deaths rested on <persName n="Staunton,,Edwin,M.,," id="n0001.0022.00311.01959" reg="default:Staunton,Edwin,M.,,"><foreName>Edwin</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Staunton</surname></persName>?</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>Unfortunately, the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and the captures at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, now gave the <rs>Federal Government</rs> a large excess of prisoners actually in hand, and enabled them to carry out the policy which they had all along evidently preferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>Instead of fulfilling the terms of the cartel, they cooly notified <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n0001.0022.00312.01960" reg="nearbymention:Ould,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName> that henceforth <quote><hi rend="italics">exchanges will be confined to such equivalents as are held in confinement on either side</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>The plain meaning of this was that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> treated as a nulity the terms of the cartel, arid the large number of <hi rend="italics">paroles</hi> which the <rs>Confederates</rs> held against them, and proposed to exchange man for man of <hi rend="italics">those actually in prison</hi>, which would have released every single prisoner held by the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and left some <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our own brave soldiers to languish and die in hopeless captivity, notwithstanding the fact that the <rs>Confederates</rs> (carrying out the terms of the cartel) had already paroled their equivalents of Federal soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>The Confederate <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs>, of course, indignantly rejected this proposition, and the subsequent correspondence until <dateStruct value="1864-08-10"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="10">10th</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, abounds in earnest efforts on the part of <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n0001.0022.00312.01961" reg="nearbymention:Ould,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName> to induce the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to return to the cartel, and their quibbles, excuses, and evasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>We very much regret that we have not space to publish this correspondence in full.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>Indeed we could desire no better vindication of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> than the publication of every letter which passed between the commissioners.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>Notwithstanding the fact that this was their own proposition, and would have worked largely in their favor as it ignored the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of paroles held by the <rs>Confederates</rs> and would have released all Federal prisoners and have left a large number of Confederates in captivity, the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities <hi rend="italics">never deigned to give an answer</hi> <pb id="p.313" n="313"/><hi rend="italics">to this letter</hi>.

<head>Summing up</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4727"/>of this whole question of the treatment of prisoners during the war. We think that we have established the following points:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4728"/><num value="1">1</num>. The laws of the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName>, the orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, the regulations of the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon-General</rs>, the action of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in the field, and the orders of those who had the immediate charge of the prisoners, all provided that prisoners in the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs> should be kindly treated, supplied with the same rations which our soldiers had, and cared for when sick in hospitals placed on <hi rend="italics">precisely the same footing as the hospitals for Confederate soldiers</hi>. <pb id="p.326" n="326"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4729"/><num value="2">2</num>. If these regulations were violated in individual instances, and if subordinates were sometimes cruel to prisoners, it was without the knowledge or consent of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, which always took prompt action on any case reported to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4730"/><num value="3">3</num>. If the prisoners failed to get their full rations, and had those of inferior quality, the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers suffered in precisely the same way, and to the same extent, and it resulted from that system of warfare adopted by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, which carried desolation and ruin to every part of the <rs>South</rs> they could reach, and which in starving the <rs>Confederates</rs> into submission brought the same evils upon their own men in Southern prisons.</p>

The mortality in Southern prisons (fearfully large, although <hi rend="italics">over <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> less than the mortality in Northern prisons</hi>), resulted from causes beyond the control of our authorities &mdash; from epidemics, &amp;c., which might have been avoided, or greatly mitigated, had not the <rs>Federal Government</rs> declared medicines <quote>contraband of war</quote> --refused the proposition of <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n0001.0022.00326.02136" reg="mostcommon:Ould,Robert,,,:13"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, that each Government should send its own surgeons with medicines, hospital stores, &amp;c., to minister to soldiers in prison &mdash; declined his proposition to send medicines to its own men in Southern prisons, without being required to allow the <rs>Confederates</rs> the same privilege &mdash; refused to allow the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to buy medicines for gold, tobacco or cotton, which it offered to pledge its honor should be used only for Federal prisoners in its hands &mdash; refused to exchange sick and wounded &mdash; and neglected from <dateStruct value="1864-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1864-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, to accede to <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n0001.0022.00326.02137" reg="mostcommon:Ould,Robert,,,:13"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>'s proposition to send transportation to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and receive <hi rend="italics">without equivalent</hi> from <num value="10000">ten</num> to <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> Federal prisoners, notwithstanding the fact that this offer was accompanied with a statement of the utter inability of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to provide for these prisoners, and a detailed report of the monthly mortality at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, and that <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n0001.0022.00326.02138" reg="mostcommon:Ould,Robert,,,:13"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, again and again, urged compliance with his humane proposal.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5701"/>Our president has appropriately introduced the series of historical lectures with the inquiry, why so few have attempted to preserve the record of the great events in the history of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and to. embalm the memories of the illustrious actors therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5702"/>Perhaps, it may not be amiss in me to pursue the same line of thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5703"/>For, if the neglect of our past history be due to the lack of materials, then our organization is in vain, and our time and our labor will be thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5704"/>The truth, however, is that our materials have been rich and lustrous, and the causes which have led to the neglect of them can only be explained by an examination into the characteristics of our people and those surroundings which have moulded their thoughts and their actions.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5705"/>We look for an explanation of this neglect, in part, to the influence exerted in the <rs>State</rs> by the <name>Scotch</name>-<name>Irish</name> population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5706"/>These people have ever been <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-fearing, law-loving, law-abiding, honest, truthful, energetic and courageous; but they are, to the last degree unpoetic and averse to hero-worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5707"/>They never canonize saints, nor idolize warriors and statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5708"/>This rugged race bore the brunt of the contest in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5709"/>They fought the battles of freedom for freedom's sake, and when that guerdon was won, they cared not to exalt the merits or the prowess of this or that leader, each conscious of his own equal worthiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5710"/>The Scotch-Irish disdained the laudations of heroes as much as their great religious leader, <persName n="Knox,,John,,," id="n0001.0031.00389.02806" reg="default:Knox,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Knox</surname></persName>, disdained <quote>to fear the face of mortal man.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5711"/>Such a people would be slow to build monuments, erect statues and write histories to commemorate deeds of high emprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5712"/>Perhaps, this self-reliant, self-asserting and unsentimental people would regard everything that looked like hero-worship as unmanly and contemptible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5713"/>This partial explanation of the neglect of history applies only to the <num value="2">two</num> Carolinas, and in looking over the whole Southern field we must seek a more general explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5714"/><persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0001.0031.00389.02807" reg="mostcommon:Channing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <pb id="p.390" n="390"/><num value="1">one</num> of the ablest and fairest of the many gifted men of the <rs>North</rs>, said <measure n="34years" type="date">thirty-four years</measure> ago that the great passion of the <rs>South</rs> was for political power, while the great passion of the <rs>North</rs> was for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5715"/>We give his language in the contrast which he made between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>: <quote>The South,</quote> said he, <quote>has abler politicians, and almost necessarily so, because its opulent class makes politics the business of life. * * * * In the <rs>South</rs> an unnatural state of things turns men's thoughts to political ascendency, but in the free States men think little of it. Property is the good for which they toil perseveringly from morning to night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5716"/>Even the political partisan among us has an eye to property, and seeks office as the best, perhaps only way of subsistence.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5717"/>This is a pretty frank confession from a Northern scholar that Northern politicians seek office mainly in order to make money thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5718"/>It reads very mach like prophecy in the revelations of the last few years of Credit Mobilier, Emma Mine Stock, Seneca Stone Contracts, Whisky-Ring Frauds, Pacific Mails Subsidies, and Sales of Sutlers' Posts, etc., etc. But while <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0001.0031.00390.02808" reg="mostcommon:Channing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName> gave the distinction in the characteristics of the <num value="2">two</num> sections with great fairness, he did not give the philosophy of that distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5719"/>We might still inquire, Why does the <rs>North</rs> covet money and the <rs>South</rs> political power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5720"/>We think that the solution of the problem is to be found in the density of the population in the <num value="1">one</num> section, and the sparseness of population in the other, with all the modifying influence brought in by this difference of population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5721"/>The <rs>North</rs> has devoted itself, from necessity, to commerce and the mechanic arts; the <rs>South</rs> has devoted itself to a pure agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5722"/>In rural districts there may be great stinginess and meanness, but greed of money is not a prominent vice, and great wealth is almost unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5723"/>The temptation is wanting, and therefore the vice is not found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5724"/>Literature and the arts and the sciences are not cultivated to a high point among an agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5725"/>These studies require debate, discussion and antagonism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5726"/>It is true that the great thinkers of the world have generally been born and reared in the country, but it is equally true that they did not become distinguished until their minds had received the attrition of town life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5727"/>Plodding, pains-taking historians, hard-working students of science, enthusiastic devotees to the arts are not found in the rural districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5728"/>The free, fresh air of the country is unfavorable to all that sort of thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5729"/>Literary and scientific men, if not born in great centres of trade and commerce, go there to meet congenial spirits, <pb id="p.391" n="391"/>or to find the appliances of their art. The South has had no literature and no science, because she has always had a sparse population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5730"/>The ambitious have had but <num value="2">two</num> roads to fame; the <num value="1">one</num> led, in time of peace, to legislative and congressional halls; the other led, in time of war, to the tented field and the battle-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5731"/>There never has been a scientific monthly or weekly published in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>The only well-sustained review ever attempted here dealt mainly in political questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>This, under the management of <persName n="Legare,,Hugh,Swinton,," id="n0001.0031.00391.02809" reg="default:Legare,Hugh,Swinton,,"><foreName>Hugh</foreName> <foreName>Swinton</foreName> <surname>Legare</surname></persName>, had almost the ability of the great <name>English</name> quarterlies, but its discussions were confined almost exclusively to matters of state-craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5734"/>After a time it shared the fate of all our Southern magazines &mdash; died for want of patronage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5735"/>To sneer at an agricultural people for deficiency in literature and science, is just as unfair as to sneer at a commercial people for lack of those qualities which are alone found in farming communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5736"/>In the thinly settled South, as has been said, the ambitious found but two high roads to distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5737"/>The character of our people is to be judged, then, by the manner in which they acquitted themselves in the struggle for military and political fame, and not in the struggle for moneyed power or literary and scientific preeminence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5738"/>Has the <rs>South</rs> succeeded in furnishing brave soldiers and wise statesmen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5739"/>This will be my investigation to-night.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5741"/>In that contest, the <rs>South</rs> furnished troops out of all proportion to the numbers of her population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5742"/>Northern soldiers never came to the relief of the <rs>South</rs>, but almost all the battle-fields of the <rs>North</rs> were drenched with Southern blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5743"/>At the battle of <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, a regiment of Marylanders fought so stoutly and checked the <rs>British</rs> advance so long, that it was virtually destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5926"/>This entire want of personal knowledge of the actual events of that defence, together with engrossing occupations elsewhere, may supply the explanation why he could fall into the wholly erroneous, and I must add, wrongful conclusions which I have cited, that the historical results of the defence of the coast of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> were but consequences of premises which he had witnessed and noted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6546"/>They were <pb id="p.450" n="450"/>fully aware that neither Constitution nor laws gave them any right to coerce a State to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6551"/>New York, the financial capital of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, was well known to be opposed to the faction and to coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6552"/>The previous Congress had expired without daring to pass any coercive measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6554"/>[Subsequent events and declarations betrayed also how well the <rs>Lincoln</rs> faction knew at the time that it was utterly unlawful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6557"/>The same was the tone of all the war speakers and war journals at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6558"/>They admitted that a State could not be coerced into the <rs>Union</rs>; but they held that no State really and legitimately desired to go out, or had gone out--<quote>the <orgName n="Great Union" type="union">great Union</orgName>-loving majority in the <rs>South</rs> had been overruled by a factious secession minority, and the <rs>Union</rs> troops were only to liberate them from that violence, and enable them to declare their unabated love for the <rs>Union</rs>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6647"/>My Dear Sir &mdash; So far, the population on either side the <rs>Ohio</rs> remain quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6648"/>Our former relation of good neighborhood continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6649"/>The boats in the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> trade from this Valley yet make their trips, but have had difficulty in some instances in procuring freights, especially in the provision line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6650"/>The people of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> profess to desire peace and commerce with us; but it is not to be denied that the public mind is in a sensitive condition, rendering it easy for the worst men on either side the border to produce difficulties which might become widespread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6651"/>To avoid this, I learn that the good and substantial men on both sides have taken measures, by committees of safety, &amp;c., to watch and suppress any out-break.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6652"/>I doubt very much the expediency of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> sending any troops to the western border, at least for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6653"/>The appearance of troops at <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, <placeName reg="Parkersburg, Wood, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119512">Parkersburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Point Pleasant, Mason, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119619">Point Pleasant</placeName>, or any places on the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, would serve to irritate and invite aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6654"/>You could not send enough to do much good, if they chose to invade <hi rend="italics">from the other side</hi>. They can concentrate on <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName> <num value="50000">50,000</num> men from the other side in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> by <pb id="p.457" n="457"/>the various railroads leading to that point; so at <placeName reg="Parkersburg, Wood, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119512">Parkersburg</placeName>, but in less numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6655"/><placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 1" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">The Ohio</placeName> is fordable in the <rs type="season">summer</rs> and <rs type="season">fall</rs> at many points, and the whole river, from Sandy to the end of <placeName reg="Hancock, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2047381">Hancock</placeName>, easily crossed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6656"/>We have here, and in all the counties, volunteer companies, <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guards</orgName>, &amp;c. Our mountains are full of rifles, and if invaded, we shall give a good account of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6657"/>The question with us is, whether we are not better off, left to ourselves, than to have a small and inadequate force sent to us, which might merely serve as an excuse for an outbreak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6658"/>What we need is guns in the hands of our own companies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6659"/>Whether it might be well to have some troops in the interior, at long distance from the river &mdash; such a point as <persName n="Grafton,,,,," id="n0001.0040.00457.03851" reg="mostcommon:Grafton,nomatch:0"><surname>Grafton</surname></persName> or <placeName reg="Piedmont, Augusta, Virginia" key="tgn,2113636">Piedmont</placeName>, on the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>--might be worthy of consideration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6660"/>Troops in any of the counties on the rivers would most probably cut off every supply from below, both for the army and the resident population.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6661"/>I have ventured to throw out these suggestions, not formally, as to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs>, but in the freedom of private friendship, knowing your anxiety to do your whole duty in this crisis, and your wish to obtain information from every part of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6662"/>I found on reaching home a member of my family in a critical condition (the main cause of my return); this still continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6663"/>I had expected the <rs>Convention</rs> to have adjourned before this time, but I could not have returned to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 36" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> ere this, for the reason mentioned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6664"/>I am well aware that your whole time is occupied with public affairs, but if in the midst of your official duties and burdens you can snatch a moment for a line to me, it would afford me the utmost pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6665"/>Is this likely to be a general war of invasion, or are the stupids at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to attempt a scheme of blockade and border foray, starvation, &amp;c., by cutting off commerce?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6666"/>I need not say that it will afford me the utmost pleasure to be of any service to you in this part of the <rs>State</rs>, and I hope you will not hesitate to call upon me. Your communications, when necessary, shall be held as strictly confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6673"/>He agrees with you that it would be impossible for us to raise a force at this time sufficiently strong to resist the large bodies of troops in the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, at the command of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and that it is inexpedient and unwise to invite an invasion by the concentration of troops among you. But he thinks it important to guard your section from the lawless bands which may be tempted to make raids upon you if they found that the volunteer force is not organized and ready for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6674"/>He has therefore instructed the officers placed in command to gather a volunteer force at <placeName reg="Grafton, Taylor, West Virginia" key="tgn,2118426">Grafton</placeName>, the point designated by you, from the surrounding counties, and hold it in readiness to be employed at any point where its services may be required.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6675"/>Arms have been sent to the volunteer companies, but no troops have or will be sent from this part of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6676"/>While this line of policy is suggested by our comparative weakness, and by the difficulty of collecting, in any short time, an organized force in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, sufficient to meet a large body of troops coming against us, it is also called for by the distracted and divided state of our own people; and I know of no better way of establishing unity of feeling and of securing a hearty co-operation on the part of all our citizens, in the support of the <rs>State</rs>, in the position it now occupies, than by placing arms in the hands of men known to be loyal and true, to be used in their own defence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6786"/>It will be seen at a glance that the above contributions are very valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6787"/>And are there not scattered all through the homes of our people similar, or even more valuable material, which they might send us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6788"/>Remember that where our friends have valuable material which they are unwilling to give us, we would be very glad to receive it <hi rend="italics">as a loan</hi>, promising to carefully preserve and return it whenever desired.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6790"/>And even where we have reports or other documents, it is important for us to secure duplicates, which we can always use to advantage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6791"/>We are desirous of securing even odd numbers of newspapers published during the war, to enable us to complete our files.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6792"/>And we would be especially pleased to secure files of our Southern Religious papers, sermons, tracts, &amp;c., as we desire to put the <rs>Confederacy</rs> right on the record as to the character of our leaders, soldiers, and people, and the spirit in which they entered upon and conducted the war. <milestone unit="hr"/> </p>
