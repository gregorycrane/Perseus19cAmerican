<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The disruption of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> by the war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was not an unforeseen event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/><placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, and other patriots who struggled against the adoption of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> by the <rs>Southern States</rs>, foretold it in burning words of prophecy; and when that instrument was adopted, when the great name and great eloquence of <persName n="Madison,,James,,," id="n0133.0001.00017.00001" reg="default:Madison,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> had borne down all opposition, <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> and his compatriots seemed particularly anxious that posterity should be informed of the manly struggle which they had made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/><placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> said, <q direct="unspecified">The voice of tradition, I trust, will inform posterity of our struggles for freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>If our descendants be worthy of the name of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0133.0001.00017.00002" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, they will preserve, and hand down to the latest posterity, the transactions of the present times; and though I confess my explanations are not worth the hearing, they will see I have done my utmost to preserve their liberty.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/></p> 
<p>The wish of these patriotic men has been gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The record of their noble deeds, and all but inspired eloquence, has come down to posterity, and some, at least, of their descendants, <q direct="unspecified">worthy of the name of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0133.0001.00017.00003" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>,</q> will accord to them the foremost rank in the long list of patriots and sages who illustrated and adorned our early annals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>But posterity, too, has a history to record and hand down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>We, too, have struggled to preserve our liberties, and the liberties of those who are to come after us; and the history of that struggle must not perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The <num value="1">one</num> struggle is but the complement of the other, and history would be incomplete if either <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> were omitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Events have vindicated the wisdom of <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>, and those who struggled with him against the adoption of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Events will equally vindicate the wisdom of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0001.00018.00004" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and other Confederate patriots, who endeavored to preserve that Constitution, and hand it down, unimpaired, to their posterity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The wisdom of a movement is not always to be judged by its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Principles are eternal, human events are transitory, and it sometimes takes more than <num value="1">one</num> generation or <num value="1">one</num> revolution to establish a principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight, it may appear that there is some discordance between <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName> and <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0001.00018.00005" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, as the <num value="1">one</num> struggled against the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the other to preserve it. But they were, in fact, both engaged in a similar struggle; the object of both being to preserve the sovereignty of their respective States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> did not object so much to the nature of the partnership, into which his State was about to enter, as to the the nature of the partners with whom she was about to contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He saw that the <num value="2">two</num> sections were dissimilar, and that they had different and antagonistic interests, and he was unwilling to trust to the <hi rend="italics">bona fides</hi> of the other contracting party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><q direct="unspecified">I am sure,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">that the dangers of this system are real, when those who have no similar interests with the people of this country are to legislate for us&mdash;when our dearest interests are to be left in the hands of those whose advantage it will be to infringe them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/></p> 
<p>The <rs>North</rs>, even at that early day, was in a majority in both houses of Congress; it would be for the advantage of that majority to infringe the rights of the <rs>South</rs>; and <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>, with much more knowledge of human nature than most of the <rs>Southern</rs> statesmen of his era, refused to trust that majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This was substantially the case with <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0001.00018.00006" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and those of us who followed his lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We had verified the distrust of <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>What had been prophecy with him, had become history with us. We had had experience of the fact, that our partner-States of the <rs>North</rs>, who were in a majority, had trampled upon the rights of the <rs>Southern</rs> minority, and we desired, as the only remedy, to dissolve the partnership into which <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName></persName> had objected to entering&mdash;not so much because <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> of any defect in the articles of copartnership, as for want of faith in our copartners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This was the wisdom of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0001.00019.00007" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his compatriots, which, I say, will be vindicated by events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A final separation of these States must come, or the <rs>South</rs> will be permanently enslaved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We endeavored to bring about the separation, and we sacrificed our fortunes, and risked our lives to accomplish it. Like <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, we have done our <q direct="unspecified">utmost to preserve our liberties;</q> like him, we have failed, and like him, we desire that our record shall go down to such of our posterity as may be <q direct="unspecified">worthy of the name of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0133.0001.00019.00008" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/></p> 
<p>The following memoirs are designed to commemorate a few of the less important events of our late struggle; but before I enter upon them, I deem it appropriate to give some <q direct="unspecified">reason for the faith</q> that was in us, of the <rs>South</rs>, who undertook the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The judgment which posterity will form upon our actions will depend, mainly, upon the answers which we may be able to give to <num value="2">two</num> questions: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, Had the <rs>South</rs> the right to dissolve the compact of government under which it had lived with the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>and, secondly, Was there sufficient reason for such dissolution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I do not speak here of the right of revolution&mdash;this is inherent in all peoples, whatever may be their form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The very term <q direct="unspecified">revolution</q> implies a forcible disruption of government, war, and all the evils that follow in the train of war. The <num value="13">thirteen</num> original Colonies, the germ from which have sprung these States, exercised the right of revolution when they withdrew their allegiance from the parent country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Not so with the <rs>Southern States</rs> when they withdrew from their copartnership with the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They exercised a higher right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They did not form a part of a consolidated government, as the <name>Colonies</name> did of the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They were sovereign, equally with the <rs>Northern States</rs>, from which they withdrew, and exercised, as they believed, a peaceful right, instead of a right of revolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Had, then, the <rs>Southern States</rs> the peaceful right to dissolve the compact of government under which they had lived with the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>A volume might be written in reply to this <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> question, but I shall merely glance at it in these memoirs, referring the student to the history of the formation of the old Confederacy, prior to the adoption of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>; to the <q direct="unspecified">Journal and Debates of the <rs>Convention</rs> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>,</q> that formed this latter instrument; to the debates of the several State Conventions which adopted it, to the <q direct="unspecified">Madison Papers,</q> to the <q direct="unspecified">Federalist,</q> and to the late very able work of <persName n="Bledsoe,Doctor,,,," id="n0133.0001.00020.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bledsoe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Bledsoe</surname></persName>, entitled <q direct="unspecified">Is <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0133.0001.00020.00010" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> a Traitor?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It will be sufficient for the purpose which I have in view&mdash;that of giving the reader a general outline of the course of reasoning, by which Southern men justify their conduct in the late war&mdash;to state the leading features of the compact of government which was dissolved, and a few of its historical surroundings, about which there can be no dispute.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The close of the <rs>War</rs> of Independence of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> found the <num value="13">thirteen</num> original Colonies, which had waged that war, sovereign and independent States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They had, for the purpose of carrying on that war, formed a league, or confederation, and the articles of this league were still obligatory upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Under these articles, a Federal Government had been established, charged with a few specific powers, such as conducting the foreign affairs of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the regulation of commerce, &amp;c. At the formation of this Government, it was intended that it should be perpetual, and was so declared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It lasted, notwithstanding, only a few years, for peace was declared in <dateStruct value="1783--"><year reg="1783">1783</year></dateStruct>, and the <hi rend="italics">perpetual</hi> Government ceased to exist in <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>How did it cease to exist?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>By the <hi rend="italics">secession</hi> of the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Soon after the war, a <orgName n="Delegates Convention" type="convention">convention of delegates</orgName> met at <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, sent thither by the several States, for the purpose of devising some more perfect means of regulating commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This was all the duty with which they were charged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Upon assembling, it was found that several of the <name>States</name> were not represented in this Convention, in consequence of which, the <rs>Convention</rs> adjourned without transacting any business, and recommended, in an address prepared by <persName n="Hamilton,,Alexander,,," id="n0133.0001.00020.00011" reg="default:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, that a new convention should be called at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, with enlarged powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><q direct="unspecified">The Convention,</q> says <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0133.0001.00020.00012" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">are more naturally led to this conclusion, as in their reflections on the subject, they have been induced to <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> think, that the power of regulating trade is of such comprehensive extent, and will enter so far into the great system of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, that to give it efficacy, and to obviate questions and doubts concerning its precise nature and limits, may require a corresponding adjustment in other parts of the <hi rend="italics">Federal</hi> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>That these are important defects in the system of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is acknowledged by the acts of those States, which have concurred in the present meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>That the defects, upon closer examination, may be found greater and more numerous than even these acts imply, is at least, so far probable, from the embarrassments which characterize the present state of our national affairs, foreign and domestic, as may reasonably be supposed to merit a deliberate and candid discussion, in some mode which will unite the sentiments and counsels of all the <name>States</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/></p> 
<p>The reader will observe that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <name>States</name>, under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, is called a <q direct="unspecified">Federal Government,</q> and that the object proposed to be accomplished by the meeting of the new Convention at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, was to <hi rend="italics">amend</hi> the <rs>Constitution</rs> of that <hi rend="italics">Government</hi>. Northern writers have sought to draw a distinction between the <rs>Government</rs> formed under the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, and that formed by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, calling the <num value="1">one</num> a league, and the other a government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Here we see <persName n="Hamilton,,Alexander,,," id="n0133.0001.00021.00013" reg="default:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> calling the <name>Confederation</name> a government&mdash;a Federal Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was, indeed, both a league and a government, as it was formed by sovereign States; just as the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is both a league and a government, for the same reason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The fact that the laws of the <name>Confederation</name>, passed in pursuance of its League, or Constitution, were to operate upon the <hi rend="italics">States;</hi> and the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were to operate upon the <hi rend="italics">individual citizens</hi> of the <name>States</name>, without the intervention of State authority, could make no difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>This did not make the latter more a government than the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The difference was a mere matter of detail, a mere matter of machinery&mdash;nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It did not imply more or less absolute sovereignty in the <num value="1">one</num> case, than in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Whatever of sovereignty had been granted, had been granted <hi rend="italics">by the <name>States</name></hi>, in both instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><pb id="p.22" n="22"/></p> 
<p>The new Convention met in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="1787-05-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1787</year>,</dateStruct> with instructions to devise and discuss <q direct="unspecified">all such <hi rend="italics">alterations</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">further</hi> provisions as may be necessary to render the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> adequate to the exigencies of the <rs>Union</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We see, thus, that the very Convention which framed the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, equally called the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation a Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was, then, from a Constitutional, Federal Government, that the <name>States</name> seceded when they adopted the present <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> I A <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">Convention of the States</orgName> assembled with powers only to amend the <rs>Constitution</rs>; instead of doing which, it abolished the old form of government altogether, and recommended a new <num value="1">one</num>, and no <num value="1">one</num> complained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>As each State formally and deliberately adopted the new government, it as formally and deliberately seceded from the old <num value="1">one</num>; and yet no <num value="1">one</num> heard any talk of a breach of faith, and still less of treason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The new government was to go into operation when <num value="9">nine</num> States should adopt it. But there were <num value="13">thirteen</num> States, and if <num value="9">nine</num> States only acceded to the new government, the old <num value="1">one</num> would be broken up, as to the other <num value="4">four</num> States, whether these would or not, and they would be left to provide for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It was by no means the voluntary breaking up of a compact, <hi rend="italics">by all the parties to it</hi>. It was broken up piece-meal, each State acting for itself, without asking the consent of the others; precisely as the <rs>Southern States</rs> acted, with a view to the formation of a new <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>So far from the movement being unanimous, it was a long time before all the <name>States</name> came into the new government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/><placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, which hounded on the war against the <rs>Southern States</rs>, retained her separate sovereignty for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before she joined the new government, not uttering <num value="1">one</num> word of complaint, during all that time, that the old government, of which she had been a member, had been unduly broken up, and that she had been left to shift for herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Why was this disruption of the old government regarded as a matter of course?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Simply because it was a league, or treaty, between sovereign States, from which any <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> had the right to withdraw at any time, without consulting the interest or advantage of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><pb id="p.23" n="23"/></p> 
<p>But, say the <rs>Northern States</rs>, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> is a very different thing from the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It was formed, not by the <name>States</name>, but by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate, and made all the <name>States</name> <num value="1">one</num> people, <num value="1">one</num> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It is not a compact, or league between the <name>States</name>, but an instrument under which they have surrendered irrevocably their sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Under it, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has become the paramount authority, and the <name>States</name> are subordinate to it. We will examine this doctrine, briefly, in another chapter. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The nature of the <rs>American</rs> compact.</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The <num value="2">two</num> principal expounders of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, in the <rs>North</rs>, have been <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName> and Joseph Story, both from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The latter has written an elaborate work on the <rs>Constitution</rs>, full of sophistry, and not always very reliable as to its facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The great effort of both these men has been to prove, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> is not a compact between the <name>States</name>, but an instrument of government, formed by the <hi rend="italics">people</hi> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as contradistinguished from the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They both admit, that if the <rs>Constitution</rs> were a compact between the <name>States</name>, the <name>States</name> would have a right to withdraw from the compact&mdash;all agreements between States, in their sovereign capacity, being, necessarily, of no more binding force than treaties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>These gentlemen are not always very consistent, for they frequently fall into the error of calling the <rs>Constitution</rs> a compact, when they are not arguing this particular question; in short, it is, and it is not a compact, by turns, according to the use they intend to make of the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/><persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0002.00024.00015" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s doctrine of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, chiefly relied on by Northern men, is to be found in his speech of <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, in reply to <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0002.00024.00016" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is in that speech that he makes the admission, that if the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> is a compact between the <name>States</name>, the <name>States</name> have the right to withdraw from it at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>He says, <q direct="unspecified">If a league between sovereign powers have no limitation as to the time of duration, and contains nothing making it perpetual, it subsists only during the good pleasure of the parties, although no violation be complained of. If in the opinion of either party it be violated, such party may say he will no longer <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> fulfil its obligations, on his part, but will consider the whole league or compact as at an end, although it might be <num value="1">one</num> of its stipulations that it should be perpetual.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But now a new question arose, which was, whether the <rs>Constitution</rs> was to be <q direct="unspecified">ordained and established</q> by the <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> legislatures of the <name>States</name>, or by the people of the <name>States</name> in Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>All were agreed, as we have seen, that the instrument should be referred to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>This had been settled; but there were differences of opinion as to how the <name>States</name> should act upon it. Some were in favor of permitting each of the <name>States</name> to choose, for itself, how it would ratify it; others were in favor of referring it to the legislatures, and others, again, to the people of the <name>States</name> in Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It was finally decided that it should be referred to Conventions of the people, in the different States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>This being done, their work was completed, and it only remained to refer the rough draft of the instrument to the <q direct="unspecified">Committee on Style,</q> to prune and polish it a little &mdash; to lop off a word here, and change or add a word there, the better to conform the language to the sense, and to the proprieties of grammar and rhetoric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The Preamble, as it stood, at once presented a difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>All the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States were named in it as adopting the instrument, but it had been provided, in the course of its deliberations by the <rs>Convention</rs>, that the new government should go into effect if <num value="9">nine</num> States adopted it. Who could tell which these <num value="9">nine</num> States would be?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>It was plainly impossible to enumerate all the <name>States</name>&mdash;for all of them might not adopt it&mdash;or any particular number of them, as adopting the instrument.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Further, it having been determined, as we have seen, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be adopted by the people of the several States, as contra-distinguished from the legislatures of the <name>States</name>, the phraseology of the <name>Preamble</name> must be made to express this idea also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>To meet these <num value="2">two</num> new demands upon the phraseology of the instrument, the <rs>Committee</rs> on Style adopted the expression, <q direct="unspecified">We, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</q> &mdash;meaning, as every <num value="1">one</num> must see, <q direct="unspecified">We, the people of the several States united by this instrument.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>And this is the foundation that the <rs>Northern</rs> advocates of a consolidated government build upon, when they declare that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate, as <num value="1">one</num> nation, adopted the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and thus gave the fundamental law to the <name>States</name>, instead of the <name>States</name> giving it to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It is well known that this phrase, <q direct="unspecified">We, the people,</q> &amp;c., be <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> came a subject of discussion in the <rs>Virginia</rs> ratifying Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>His great object was to establish a consolidated republic, if we must have a republic at all. He labored zealously for this purpose, but failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The States, without an exception, were in favor of the federal form; and no <num value="1">one</num> knew better than <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0133.0002.00033.00048" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> the kind of government which had been established.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Now let us hear what <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0133.0002.00033.00049" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, an unwilling, but an honest witness, says on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Of the <num value="85">eighty-five</num> articles in the <q direct="unspecified">Federalist,</q> <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0133.0002.00033.00050" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> wrote no less than <num value="50">fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Having failed to procure the establishment of a consolidated government, his next great object was, to procure the adoption by the <name>States</name> of <pb id="p.34" n="34"/> the present Constitution, and to this task, accordingly, he now addressed his great intellect and powerful energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>In turning over the pages of the <q direct="unspecified">Federalist,</q> we can scarcely go amiss in quoting <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0133.0002.00034.00051" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, to the point that the <rs>Constitution</rs> is a compact between the <name>States</name>, and not an emanation from the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Let us take up the final article, for instance, the <num value="85" type="ordinal">85th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>In this article we find the following expressions: <q direct="unspecified">The compacts which are to embrace <num value="13">thirteen</num> distinct States in a common bond of amity and Union, must necessarily be compromises of as many dissimilar interests and inclinations.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Again: <q direct="unspecified">The moment an alteration is made in the present plan, it becomes, to the purpose of adoption, a new <num value="1">one</num>, and must undergo a new decision of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>To its complete establishment throughout the <rs>Union</rs>, it will, therefore, require the concurrence of <num value="13">thirteen</num> States.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/></p> 
<p>And again: <q direct="unspecified">Every Constitution for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> must, inevitably, consist of a great variety of particulars, in which <num value="13">thirteen</num> <hi rend="italics">Independent States</hi> are to be accommodated in their interests, or opinions of interests. * * * Hence the necessity of moulding and arranging all the particulars which are to compose the whole in such a manner as to satisfy all the <hi rend="italics">parties to the compact</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Thus, we do not hear <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n0133.0002.00034.00052" reg="nearbymention:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, any more than <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n0133.0002.00034.00053" reg="nearbymention:Madison,James,,,"><surname>Madison</surname></persName>, talking of a <q direct="unspecified">people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate</q> as having anything to do with the formation of the new charter of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>He speaks only of States, and of compacts made or to be made by States.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In view of the great importance of the question, whether it was the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate who <q direct="unspecified">ordained and established</q> the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or the <name>States</name>,&mdash; for this, indeed, is the whole <hi rend="italics">gist</hi> of the controversy between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>,&mdash;I have dwelt somewhat at length on the subject, and had recourse to contemporaneous history; but this was scarcely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The Constitution itself settles the whole controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> article of that instrument reads as follows: <quote>The ratification of the <name>Conventions</name> of <num value="9">nine</num> States shall be sufficient for the establishment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> between the <name>States</name> so ratifying the same.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>How is it possible to reconcile this short, explicit, and unambiguous provision with the theory I am combating?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The Preamble, as explained <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> by the <rs>Northern</rs> consolidationists, and this article, cannot possibly stand together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>It is not possible that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate, as <num value="1">one</num> nation, <q direct="unspecified">ordained and established</q> the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and that the <name>States</name> ordained and established it at the same time; for there was but <num value="1">one</num> set of Conventions called, and these Conventions were called by the <name>States</name>, and acted in the names of the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/><persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0002.00035.00054" reg="nearbymention:Madison,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> did, indeed, endeavor to have the ratification made in both modes, but his motion in the <rs>Convention</rs> to this effect failed, as we have seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Further, how could the <rs>Constitution</rs> be binding only between the <name>States</name> that ratified it, if it was not ratified&mdash;that is, not <q direct="unspecified">ordained and established</q> &mdash;by them at all, but by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the aggregate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>As remarked by <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0002.00035.00055" reg="nearbymention:Madison,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>, in the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName>, a ratification by the people, in the sense in which this term is used by the <rs>Northern</rs> consolidationists, would have bound all the people, and there would have been no option left the dissenting States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>But the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> article says that they shall have an option, and that the instrument is to be binding only <hi rend="italics">between such of them as ratify it</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>With all due deference, then, to others who have written upon this vexed question, and who have differed from me in opinion, I must insist that the proof is conclusive that the <rs>Constitution</rs> is a compact between the <name>States</name>; and this being so, we have the admission of both <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0002.00035.00056" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> and <persName n="Story,Justice,,,," id="n0133.0002.00035.00057" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Justice">Justice</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName> that any <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> may withdraw from it at pleasure. </p></div1>

<head>From the foundation of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> down to <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, both the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> held the <rs>Constitution</rs> to be a compact between the <name>States</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/><num value="1">one</num> of the great difficulties in arguing the question of the relative power of the <name>States</name> and of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, consists in the fact that the present generation has grown up under the shadow of the great Federal monster, and has been blinded by its giant proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They see around them all the paraphernalia and power of a great government&mdash; its splendid capital, its armies, its fleets, its <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>, its legislature, and its judiciary&mdash;and they find it difficult to realize the fact, that all this grandeur is not self-created, but the offspring of the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>When our late troubles were culminating, men were heard frequently to exclaim, with plaintive energy, <q direct="unspecified">What!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>have we no government capable of preserving itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Is our Government a mere rope of sand, that may be destroyed at the will of the <name>States</name>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>These men seemed to think that there was but <num value="1">one</num> government to be preserved, and that that was the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Less than a century had elapsed since the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the generation now on the theatre of events had seemingly forgotten, that the magnificent structure, which they contemplated with so much admiration, was but a creature of the <name>States</name>; that it had been made by them for their convenience, and necessarily held the tenure of its life at sufferance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>They lost sight of the fact that the <rs>State</rs> governments, who were the creators of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, were the governments to be preserved, if there should be any antagonism between them and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; and that their services, as well as <pb id="p.37" n="37"/> their sympathies, belonged to the former in preference to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>What with the teachings of <persName n="Webster,,,,," id="n0133.0003.00037.00058" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><surname>Webster</surname></persName> and Story, and a host of satellites, the dazzling splendor of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and the overshadowing and corrupting influences of its power, nearly a whole generation in the <rs>North</rs> had grown up in ignorance of the true nature of the institutions, under which they lived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>This change in the education of the people had taken place since about the year <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>; for, up to that time, both of the great political parties of the country, the <rs>Whigs</rs> as well as the <name>Democrats</name>, had been State-Rights in doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>A very common error has prevailed on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It has been said, that the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> have always been widely separated in their views of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that the men of the <rs>North</rs> have always been consolidationists, whilst the men of the <rs>South</rs> have been secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Nothing can be farther from the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Whilst the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, from the very commencement of the <rs>Government</rs>, have been at swords' points, on many questions of mere construction and policy,&mdash;the <rs>North</rs> claiming that more ample powers had been granted the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, than the <rs>South</rs> was willing to concede,&mdash;there never was any material difference between them down to the year <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, as to the true nature of their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>They all held it to be a federal compact, and the <rs>Northern</rs> people were as jealous of the rights of their States under it, as the <rs>Southern</rs> people.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>In proof of this, I have only to refer to a few of the wellknown facts of our political history.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>A few more words, and we shall be in a condition to answer the question which stands at the head of this chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Being a legal question, it will depend entirely upon the constitutional right the <rs>Southern States</rs> may have had to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, without reference to considerations of expediency, or of moral right; these latter will be more appropriately considered, when we come to speak of the causes which impelled the <rs>Southern States</rs> to the step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>I have combated many of the arguments presented by the other side, but a few others remain to be noticed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It has been said, that, admitting that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was a federal compact, yet the <name>States</name> did in fact cede away a part of their sovereignty, and from this the inference has been deduced, that they no longer remained sovereign for the purpose of recalling the part, which had been ceded away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>This is a question which arises wholly under the laws of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It is admitted, that the <name>States</name> were independent sovereignties, before they formed the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We have only, therefore, to consult the international code, to ascertain to what extent the granting away of a portion of their sovereignty affected the remainder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Vattel, treating of this identical point, speaks as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Several sovereign and independent States may unite themselves together by a perpetual confederacy, without ceasing to be, each individually, a perfect State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>They will, together, constitute a federal republic; their joint deliberations will not impair the sovereignty of each member, though they may, in certain respects, <hi rend="italics">put some restraint upon the exercise of it</hi>, in virtue of <hi rend="italics">voluntary</hi> engagements.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>That was just what the <rs>American States</rs> did, when they formed the <rs>Federal</rs> <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> Constitution; they put some voluntary restraint upon their sovereignty, for the furtherance of a common object.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>If they are restrained, by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, from doing certain things, the restraint was self-imposed, for it was they who ordained, and established the instrument, and not a common superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They, each, agreed that they would forbear to do certain things, if their copartners would forbear to do the same things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>As plain as this seems, no less an authority than that of <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0004.00046.00085" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> has denied it; for, in his celebrated argument against <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0004.00046.00086" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, already referred to, he triumphantly exclaimed, that the <name>States</name> were not sovereign, because <hi rend="italics">they were restrained of a portion of their liberty by the <rs>Constitution</rs></hi>. See how he perverts the whole tenor of the instrument, in his endeavor to build up those manufactories of which we spoke in the last chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He says: <q direct="unspecified">However men may think this ought to be, the fact is, that <hi rend="italics">the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi> have chosen to <hi rend="italics">impose control</hi> on State sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>There are those, doubtless, who wish that they had been left without restraint; but the <rs>Constitution</rs> has ordered the matter differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>To make war, for instance, is an exercise of sovereignty, but, the <rs>Constitution</rs> declares that no State shall declare war. To coin money is another act of sovereign power; but no State is at liberty to coin money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Again; the <rs>Constitution</rs> says, that no sovereign State shall be so sovereign, as to make a treaty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>These prohibitions, it must be confessed, are a control on the <rs>State</rs> sovereignty of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, as well as of the other States, which does not arise from her feelings of honorable justice.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/></p> 
<p>Here we see, plainly, the germ of the monstrous heresy that has riven the <name>States</name> asunder, in our day. The <q direct="unspecified">people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,</q> a common superior, ordained and established the <rs>Constitution</rs>, says <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0004.00046.00087" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, and imposed restraints upon the <name>States</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>However some might wish they had been left without restraint, the <rs>Constitution</rs> has <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">ordained it differently</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>And the ostrich stomach of the <rs>North</rs> received, and digested this monstrous perversion of the plainest historical truth, in order that the spindle might whirr on, and the shuttle dance from side to side of the loom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Following the idea of <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0004.00046.00088" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>, that the people of the <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> gave constitutional law to the <name>States</name>, instead of receiving it from them, Northern writers frequently ask, in what part of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is the doctrine of secession found?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>In no part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>It was not necessary to put it there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The States who formed the instrument, delegated certain powers to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, retaining all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Did they part, with the right of secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Could they have parted with it, without consenting to a merger of their sovereignty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>And so far from doing this, we have seen with what jealous care they protested against even the implication of such a merger, in the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>If the power was not parted with, by explicit grant, did it not remain to them, even before the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> amendment was adopted, and still more, if possible, after it was adopted?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>To make it still more apparent, that the common understanding among the <name>Fathers</name> of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was, that this right of secession was reserved, it is only necessary to refer to what took place, during the transition from the old to the new government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The <num value="13">thirteen</num> original States seceded, as we have seen, from the <rs>Articles</rs> of Confederation, not unanimously, or all together, but <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, each State acting for itself, without consulting the interests, or inclinations of the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/><num value="1">One</num> of the provisions of those Articles was as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Every State shall abide by the determination of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in Congress assembled, in all questions, which, by this Confederation, are submitted to them; and the <rs>Articles</rs> of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the <rs>Union</rs> shall be <hi rend="italics">perpetual;</hi> nor shall any alteration, at any time hereafter, be made in any of them, unless such alteration be agreed to, in a <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, and be afterward confirmed <hi rend="italics">by the legislature of every State</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/></p> 
<p>Now, it is a pertinent, and instructive fact, that no similar provision of perpetuity was engrafted in the new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>There must have been a motive for this&mdash;it could not have been a mere accidental omission&mdash;and the motive probably was, that the <rs>Convention</rs> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> were ashamed to attempt, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, to bind sovereign States, by <hi rend="italics">a rope of sand</hi>, which they, themselves, were in the act of pulling asunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It was in accordance with this understanding, that both New York and <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, in their ratifications of the new Constitution, expressly reserved to themselves the right of secession; and no objection was made to such conditional ratifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The reservations made by these States enure, as a matter of course, to the benefit of all the <name>States</name>, as they were all to go into the new Union, on precisely the same footing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>In the extract from <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0004.00048.00089" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s speech, which has been given above, it is alleged among other things, that the <name>States</name> are not sovereign, because they cannot make treaties; and this disability also has been urged as an argument against secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The disability, like others, was self-imposed, and, as any <num value="1">one</num> may see, was intended to be binding on the <name>States</name> only so long as the contract which they were then forming should endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> respected this obligation while they remained in the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>They scrupulously forbore from contracting with each other until they had resumed, each for itself, their original sovereignty; they were then not only free to contract with each other, but to do and perform all the other acts enumerated by <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0004.00048.00090" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>; the act of declaring war included, even though this war should be against their late confederates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The truth is, the more we sift these arguments of our late enemies, the less real merit there appears in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The facts of history are too stubborn, and refuse to be bent to conform to the new doctrines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>We see it emblazoned on every page of American history for <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> was a compact between the <name>States</name>; that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was created, by, and for the benefit of the <name>States</name>, and possessed and could possess no other power than such as was conferred upon it by the <name>States</name>; that the <name>States</name> reserved to themselves all the powers not granted, and that they took especial pains to guard their sovereignty, in terms, by an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, lest, by possibility, their intentions in the formation of the new government, should be misconstrued.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>In the course of time this government is perverted from its original design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Instead of remaining the faithful and impartial agent of all the <name>States</name>, a faction obtains control of it, in the interests of some of them, and turns it, as an engine of oppression, against the others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>These latter, after long and <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> patient suffering, after having exhausted all their means of defence, within the <rs>Union</rs>, withdraw from the agent the powers which they had conferred upon him, form a new Confederacy, and desire <q direct="unspecified">to be let alone.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>And what is the consequence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They are denounced as rebels and traitors, armies are equipped, and fleets provided, and a war of subjugation is waged against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>What says the reader?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Does he see rebellion and treason lurking in the conduct of these States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Are they, indeed, in his opinion, in face of the record which he has inspected, so bereft of their sovereignty, as to be incapable of defending themselves, except with halters around the necks of their citizens?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Let us examine this latter question of halters for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The States existed before the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; the citizens of the <name>States</name> owed allegiance to their respective States, and to none others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>By what process was any portion of this allegiance transferred to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and to what extent was it transferred?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It was transferred by the <name>States</name>, themselves, when they entered into the federal compact, and not by the individual citizens, for these had no power to make such a transfer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Although it be admitted, that a citizen of any <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> may have had the right to expatriate himself entirely&mdash;and this was not so clear a doctrine at that day &mdash;and transfer his allegiance to another government, yet it is quite certain, that he could not, <hi rend="italics">ex mero motu</hi>, divide his allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>His allegiance then was transferred to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, by his State, whether he would or not.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Take the case of <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, for example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He resisted the adoption of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, by the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, with all the energies of an ardent nature, solemnly believing that his State was committing suicide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>And yet, when <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> did adopt that Constitution, he became, by virtue of that act, a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and owed allegiance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He had been born in the hallowed old Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>In the days of his boyhood he had played on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,1121283" n="1.000 30" reg="appomattox, virginia, united states">Appomattox</placeName>, and fished in its waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>As he grew to man's estate, all his cherished hopes, and aspirations clustered around his beloved State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The bones of his ancestors were interred in her soil; his loves, his joys, <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> his sorrows were all centred there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>In short, he felt the inspiration of patriotism, that noble sentiment which nerves men to do, and dare, unto the death, for their native soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Will it be said, <hi rend="italics">can</hi> it be said, without revolting all the best feelings of the human heart, that if <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName> had lived to see a war of subjugation waged against his native State, he would have been a traitor for striking in her defence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Was this <num value="1">one</num> of the results which our ancestors designed, when they framed the federal compact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It would be uncharitable to accuse them of such folly, and stupidity, nay of such cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>If this doctrine be true, that secession is treason, then our ancestors framed a government, which could not fail to make traitors of their descendants, in case of a conflict between the <name>States</name>, and that government, let them act as they would.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>It was frequently argued in the <q direct="unspecified">Federalist,</q> and elsewhere, by those who were persuading the <name>States</name> to adopt the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, that the <rs>State</rs> would have a sufficient guarantee of protection, in the love, and affection of its citizens&mdash;that the citizen would naturally cling to his State, and side with her against the <rs>Federal Government</rs>&mdash;that, in fact, it was rather to be apprehended that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would be too weak, and the <name>States</name> too strong, for this reason, instead of the converse of the proposition being true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>It was not doubted, in that day, that the primary and paramount allegiance of the citizen was due to his State, and, that, in case of a conflict between her and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, his State would have the right to withdraw his allegiance, from that Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>If it was she who transferred it, and if she had the right to transfer it, it follows beyond question, that she would have the right to withdraw it. It was not a case for the voluntary action of the citizen, either way; he could not, of his own free will, either give his allegiance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, or take it away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>If this be true, observe in what a dilemma he has been placed, on the hypothesis that secession is treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>If he adheres to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, after his State has withdrawn his allegiance from that Government, and takes up arms against his State, he becomes a traitor to his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>If he adheres to his State, and takes up arms against the <rs>Federal</rs> <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> Goverment, he becomes a traitor to that Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He is thus a traitor either way, and there is no helping himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Is this consistent with the supposed wisdom of the political Fathers, those practical, common sense men, who formed the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The mutations of governments, like all human events, are constantly going on. No government stands still, anymore than the individuals of which it is composed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The only difference is, that the changes are not quite so obvious to the generation which views them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> did not dare to hope that they had formed a government, that was to last forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Nay, many of them had serious misgivings as to the result of the <hi rend="italics">experiment</hi> they were making.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Is it possible, then, that those men so legislated, as to render it morally certain, that if their experiment should fail, their descendants must become either slaves or traitors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>If the doctrine that secession is treason be true, it matters not how grievously a State might be oppressed, by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; she has been deprived of the power of lawful resistance, and must regain her liberty, if at all, like other enslaved States, at the hazard of war, and rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Was this the sort of experiment in government, that our forefathers supposed they were making?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Every reader of history knows that it was not. </p></div1>

<argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Another brief historical Retrospect.</p></argument> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>in the previous chapters, I have given a brief outline of the history and formation of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, proving, by abundant reference to the <name>Fathers</name>, and to the instrument itself, that it was the intention of the former to draft, and that they did draft, a <hi rend="italics">federal compact</hi> of government, which compact was <q direct="unspecified">ordained, and established,</q> by the <name>States</name>, in their sovereign capacity, and not by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in the aggregate, as <num value="1">one</num> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>It resulted from this statement of the question, that the <name>States</name> had the legal, and constitutional right to withdraw from the compact, at pleasure, without reference to any cause of quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Accordingly, nothing has yet been said about the causes which impelled the <rs>Southern States</rs> to a separation, except indeed incidentally, when the tariff system was alluded to, as the motive which had induced <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> and the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Northern States, to change their StateRights doctrine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It was stated in the opening chapter, that the judgment which posterity will form, upon the great conflict between the sections, will depend, mainly, upon the answers which we may be able to give to <num value="2">two</num> questions: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, Had the <rs>South</rs> the right to dissolve the compact of government, under which it had lived with the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>and secondly, Was there sufficient ground for this dissolution?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Having answered the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question&mdash;imperfectly, I fear, but yet as fully, as was consistent, with the design of these pages&mdash;I propose now to consider, very briefly, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>I would gladly have left all this preliminary work to other, and abler pens, but I do not consider that the memoirs of any actor in the late war, who, like myself, was an officer in the old service, and who withdrew from that service, because of the breaking out of the war&mdash;or rather because of the secession of his State&mdash;would be complete <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> without, at least, a brief reference to the reasons, which controlled his judgment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The American Constitution died of a disease, that was inherent in it. It was framed on false principles, inasmuch as the attempt was made, through its means, of binding together, in a republican form of government, <num value="2">two</num> dissimilar peoples, with widely dissimilar interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Monarchial governments may accomplish this, since they are founded on force, but republican governments never.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/><placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, pin together, in our day, with their bayonets, many dissimilar peoples, but if a republic should make the attempt, that moment it must, of necessity, cease to be a republic, since the very foundation of such a government is the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> was a mere corollary of the <rs>American</rs> proposition of government; and the <rs>Northern States</rs> stultified themselves, the moment they attempted to resist it. The consent of the <rs>Southern States</rs> being wanted, there should have been an end of the question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>If the <rs>Northern States</rs> were not satisfied to let them go, but entertained, on the contrary, a desire to restrain them by force, this was a proof, that those States had become tired of the republican form, and desired to change it. But they should have been honest about it; they should have avowed their intentions from the beginning, and not have waged the war, as so many republics, endeavoring to coerce other republics, into a forced union with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>To have been logical, they should have obliterated the <rs>State</rs> boundaries, and have declared all the <name>States</name>&mdash;as well the <rs>Northern States</rs>, as the <rs>Southern</rs>&mdash;so many counties of a consolidated government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>But even then, they could not have made war upon any considerable number of those counties, without violating the fundamental American idea of a government&mdash;the consent of the governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>The right of self-government was vindicated in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, in favor of <num value="3000000">three millions</num> of the subjects of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>In the <name>States</name> of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, there were <num value="8000000">eight millions</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The American Republic, as has been said, was a failure, because of the antagonism of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples, attempted to be bound together, in the same government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>If there is to be but <pb id="p.54" n="54"/> a single government in these States, in the future, it cannot be a republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>De Toqueville saw this, <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago. In his <q direct="unspecified">Democracy in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName></q> he described these States, as <q direct="unspecified">more like hostile nations, than rival parties, under <num value="1">one</num> government.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/></p> 
<p>This distinguished Frenchman saw, as with the eye of intuition, the canker which lay at the heart of the federal compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>He saw looming up, in the dim distance, the ominous, and hideous form of that unbridled, and antagonistic Majority, which has since rent the country in twain&mdash;a majority based on the views, and interests of <num value="1">one</num> section, arrayed against the views, and interests of the other section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/><q direct="unspecified">The majority,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">in that country, exercises a prodigious, actual authority, and a moral influence which is scarcely less preponderant; no obstacles exist, which can impede, or so much as retard its progress, or which can induce it to heed the complaints of those whom it crushes upon its path. * * * This state of things is fatal, in itself, and dangerous for the future. * * * If the free institutions of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> are ever destroyed, that event may be attributed to the unlimited authority of the majority. * * * Anarchy will then be the result, but it will have been brought about by despotism.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/></p> 
<p>Precisely so; liberty is always destroyed by the multitude, in the name of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Majorities within the limits of constitutional restraints are harmless, but the moment they lose sight of these restraints, the many-headed monster becomes more tyrannical, than the tyrant with a single head; numbers harden its conscience, and embolden it, in the perpetration of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>And when this majority, in a free government, becomes a faction, or, in other words, represents certain classes and interests to the detriment of other classes, and interests, farewell to public liberty; the people must either become enslaved, or there must be a disruption of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>This result would follow, even if the people lived under a consolidated government, and were homogenous: much more, then, must it follow, when the government is federal in form, and the <name>States</name> are, in the words of De Toqueville, <q direct="unspecified">more like hostile nations, than rival parties, under <num value="1">one</num> government.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>These States are, and indeed always have been rival nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The dissimilarity between the people of the <rs>Northern</rs>, and <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> the people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> has always been remarked upon, by observant foreigners, and it has not escaped the attention of our own historians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Indeed it could not be otherwise, for the origin of the <num value="2">two</num> sections has been diverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/><placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> were the <num value="2">two</num> original germs, from which the great majority of the <rs>American</rs> populations has sprung; and no <num value="2">two</num> peoples, speaking the same language, and coming from the same country, could have been more dissimilar, in education, taste, and habits, and even in natural instincts, than were the adventurers who settled these <num value="2">two</num> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Those who sought a new field of adventure for themselves, and affluence for their posterity, in the more congenial climate of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, were the gay, and dashing cavaliers, who, as a class, afterward adhered to the fortunes of the <name>Charleses</name>, whilst the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settlers of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> were composed of the same materials, that formed the <q direct="unspecified">Praise-<name n="God" type="God">God</name>-Barebones</q> parliament of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0133.0005.00055.00091" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>These <num value="2">two</num> peoples, seem to have had an instinctive repugnance, the <num value="1">one</num> to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>To use a botanical phrase, the <rs>Puritan</rs> was a seedling of the <rs>English</rs> race, which had been unknown to it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>It had few, or none of the characteristics of the original stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Gloomy, saturnine, and fanatical, in disposition, it seemed to repel all the more kindly, and generous impulses of our nature, and to take a pleasure in pulling down everything, that other men had built up; not so much, as its subsequent history would seem to show, because the work was faulty, as because it had been done by other hands than their own. They hated tyranny, for instance, but it was only because they were not, themselves, the tyrants; they hated religious intolerance, but it was only when not practised by themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Natural affinities attracted like unto like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The Cavalier sought refuge with the <name>Cavalier</name>, and the <rs>Puritan</rs> with the <rs>Puritan</rs>, for a century, and more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>When the fortunes of the <name>Charleses</name> waned, the <name>Cavaliers</name> fled to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>; when the fortunes of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0133.0005.00055.00092" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> waned, the <name>Puritans</name> fled to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Trade occasionally drew the <num value="2">two</num> peoples together, but they were repelled at all other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Thus these germs grew, step by step, into <num value="2">two</num> distinct nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>A different <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> civilization was naturally developed in each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The <num value="2">two</num> countries were different in climate, and physical features&mdash;the climate of the <num value="1">one</num> being cold and inhospitable, and its soil rugged, and sterile, whilst the climate of the other was soft, and genial, and its soil generous, and fruitful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>As a result of these differences of climate, and soil, the pursuits of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples became different, the <num value="1">one</num> being driven to the ocean, and to the mechanic arts, for subsistence, and the other betaking itself to agriculture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Another important element soon presented itself, to widen the social, and economical breach, which had taken place between the <num value="2">two</num> peoples&mdash;African slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>All the <name>Colonies</name>, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, became slaveholding, but it was soon found, that slave labor was unprofitable in the <rs>North</rs>, where the soil was so niggard, in its productions, and where, besides, the white man could labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/><num value="1">One</num>, by <num value="1">one</num>, the <rs>Northern States</rs> got rid of their slaves, as soon as they made this discovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>In the <rs>South</rs>, the case was different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The superior fertility of the soil, and the greater geniality of the climate enabled the planter to employ the <name>African</name> to advantage; and thus slave labor was engrafted on our system of civilization, as <num value="1">one</num> of its permanent features.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The effect was, as before remarked, a still greater divergence between the <num value="2">two</num> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The wealth of the <rs>South</rs> soon began to outstrip that of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Education and refinement followed wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Whilst the civilization of the <rs>North</rs> was coarse, and practical, that of the <rs>South</rs> was more intellectual, and refined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>This is said in no spirit of disparagement of our Northern brethren; it was the natural, and inevitable result of the different situations of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>In the <rs>North</rs>, almost every young man was under the necessity, during our colonial existence, of laboring with his own hands, for the means of subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>There was neither the requisite leisure, nor the requisite wealth to bring about a very refined system of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The life of a Southern planter on the other hand with his large estates, and hundreds of vassals, with his profuse hospitality, and luxurious style of living, resembled more that of the feudatories of the middle ages, than that of any modern gentleman out of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>It is not my object to express a preference for either of these <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> modes of civilization&mdash;each, no doubt, had its advantages, and disadvantages&mdash;but to glance at them, merely, for the purpose of showing the dissimilarity of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples; their uncongeniality, and want of adaptation, socially, the <num value="1">one</num> to the other With social institutions as wide asunder as the poles, and with their every material interest antagonistic, the separation of the <num value="2">two</num> peoples, sooner or later, was a logical sequence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>As had been anticipated by <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName>, and others, the moment the new government went into operation, parties began to be formed, on sectional interests and sectional prejudices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The <rs>North</rs> wanted protection for her shipping, in the way of discriminating tonnage dues, and the <rs>South</rs> was opposed to such protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>The <rs>North</rs> wanted a bank, to facilitate their commercial operations; the <rs>South</rs> was opposed to it. The <rs>North</rs> wanted protection for their manufactures, the <rs>South</rs> was opposed to it. There was no warrant, of course, for any of these schemes of protection in the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>; they were, on the contrary, subversive of the original design of that instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>The South has been called aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>She was thrown on the defensive, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Congress, and has remained so, from that day to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>She never had the means to be aggressive, having been always in a minority, in both branches of the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>It is not consistent with the scope of these memoirs, to enter, at large, into the political disputes which culminated in secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>In a speech in the <name>Senate</name>, in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>, he declared himself, as follows: <q direct="unspecified">I feel for the sad changes, which have taken place in the <rs>South</rs>, during the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. Before the <name>Revolution</name>, <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> it was the seat of wealth, as well as hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>Money, and all it commanded, abounded there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>But how is it now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>All this is reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Wealth has fled from the <rs>South</rs>, and settled in regions north of the <rs>Potomac</rs>; and this in the face of the fact, that the <rs>South</rs>, in <num value="4">four</num> staples alone, has exported produce, since the <name>Revolution</name>, to the value of <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num> of dollars; and the <rs>North</rs> has exported comparatively nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Such an export would indicate unparalleled wealth, but what is the fact?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>In the place of wealth, a universal pressure for money was felt&mdash;not enough for current expenses&mdash;the price of all property down&mdash;the country drooping, and languishing&mdash;towns and cities decaying&mdash;and the frugal habits of the people pushed to the verge of universal self-denial, for the preservation of their family estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>Such a result is a strange, and wonderful phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>It calls upon statesmen to inquire into the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Under Federal legislation, the exports of the <rs>South</rs> have been the basis of the <rs>Federal</rs> revenue. * * * <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> Corolinas, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, may be said to defray <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num>, of the annual expense of supporting the <rs>Federal Government</rs>;</hi> and of this great sum, annually furnished by them, nothing, or next to nothing is returned to them, in the shape of Government expenditures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>That expenditure flows in an opposite direction&mdash;it flows northwardly, in <num value="1">one</num> uniform, uninterrupted, and perennial stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/><hi rend="italics">This is the reason why wealth disappears from the <rs>South</rs> and rises up in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Federal legislation does all this</hi>. It does it by the simple process of eternally taking from the <rs>South</rs>, and returning nothing to it. If it returned to the <rs>South</rs> the whole, or even a good part, of what it exacted, the <num value="4">four</num> States south of the <rs>Potomac</rs> might stand the action of the system, but the <rs>South</rs> must be exhausted of its money, and its property, by a course of legislation, which is forever taking away, and never returning anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Every new tariff increases the force of this action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>No tariff has ever yet included <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> Carolinas, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, except to increase the burdens imposed upon them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/></p> 
<p>This picture is not overdrawn; it is the literal truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Before the war the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and especially the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, exported next to nothing, and yet they <q direct="unspecified">blossomed as <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> the rose.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The picturesque hills of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> were dotted with costly mansions, erected with money, of which the <rs>Southern</rs> planters had been despoiled, by means of the tariffs of which <persName n="Benton,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0005.00059.00096" reg="mostcommon:Benton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benton</surname></persName> spoke.

<p>This system of spoliation was commenced in <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The doctrine of protection was not, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, boldly avowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>A heavy debt had been contracted during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, just then terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>It became necessary to raise revenue to pay this debt, as well as to defray the current expenses of the government, and for these laudable purposes, the tariff of <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> was enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The <rs>North</rs> had not yet become the overshadowing power, which it has become in our day. It was comparatively modest, and only asked, that, in adjusting the duties under the tariff, such <hi rend="italics">incidental</hi> protection, as might not be inconsistent with the main object of the bill, to wit, the raising of revenue, should be given to Northern manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>It was claimed that these manufactures had sprung up, <hi rend="italics">sua sponte</hi>, during the war, and had materially aided the country in prosecuting the war, and that they would languish, and die, unless protected, in this incidental manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>This seemed but just and reasonable, and some of the ablest of our Southern men gave their assent to the proposition; among others, <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0005.00059.00098" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0005.00059.00099" reg="mostcommon:Clay,Henry,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>. <pb id="p.60" n="60"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>The most that he claimed, was that a temporary protection, of a few years' duration only, should be given to these infant manufactures, until they should become self-sustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>In later life, when he saw the extent to which the measure was pushed, he did, indeed recoil from it, as <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0005.00060.00101" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,John,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, with keener intellect, had done, years before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>From incidental protection, it advanced, boldly, to the doctrine of <hi rend="italics"><q direct="unspecified">protection, for the sake of protection</q>&mdash;thus</hi> avowing the unjust doctrine, that it was right to rob <num value="1">one</num> section, for the benefit of the other; the pretence being the general good&mdash; the <q direct="unspecified">general welfare</q> clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs> as well as the expression <q direct="unspecified">We, the people,</q> in the <name>Preamble</name>, being invoked to cover the enormity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>From this time onward, no attempt was made to conciliate the <rs>South</rs>, by the practice of forbearance, and justice, and the latter sank, hopelessly, into the condition of a tributary province to her more powerful rival.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>as I am not writing a history of the war, but only of a very small portion of the war, it cannot be expected that I will follow events in a connected train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>I have detained the reader, so far, as to give him a continuous, though hasty glance, of the causes of the war, but having brought him down to the final rupture of the sections, I must leave him to supply for himself many a link, here and there, in the broken chain, as we proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Let him imagine then that the <rs>Southern States</rs> have seceded&mdash;the gallant little <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> setting her larger, and more powerful sisters, the example, on the <dateStruct value="1860-12-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>&mdash;and that they have met at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery, in Alabama</placeName>, by their delegates in Congress, to form a new Confederacy; that a Provisional Government has been formed and that <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0007.00071.00122" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> has been elected <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and <persName n="Stephens,Mister,Alexander,H.,," id="n0133.0007.00071.00123" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>The time had now come for the officers of the old Army, and Navy to make their election, as to which of the <num value="2">two</num> Governments they would give their adhesion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>There were no such questions then, as rebellion, and treason in the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>This was a Federal after-thought, when that Government began to get the better of us in the war. The Puritan, if he had been whipped, would have been a capital secessionist, and as meek, and humble as we could have desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>He would have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to make a <q direct="unspecified">perpetual</q> alliance with us, and to offer us inducements to give him the benefits of our trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>After the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> drubbing we gave him, at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, he was disposed to be quite reasonable, and the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> passed the conciliatory resolution I have quoted in a previous chapter, <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> intimating to us, that if we would come back, slavery should be secure in the <name>States</name>, and our <q direct="unspecified">rights and dignity</q> remain unimpaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>But as he gained strength, he gained courage, and as the war progressed, and it became evident that we should be beaten, he began to talk of traitors, and treason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>As a general rule, the officers both of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, and the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> sided with their respective States; especially those of them who were cultivated, and knew something of the form of government, under which they had been living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>But even the profession of arms is not free from sordid natures, and many of these had found their way into both branches of the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Men were found capable of drawing their swords against their own firesides, as it were, and surrendering their neighbors, and friends to the vengeance of a government, which paid them for their fealty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Some, with cunning duplicity, even encouraged their former messmates, and companions who occupied places above them, to resign, and afterward held back themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Some were mere soldiers, and sailors of fortune, and seemed devoid of all sensibility on the subject, looking only to rank and pay. They were open to the highest bidder, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was in a condition to make the highest bids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Some of the <rs>Southern</rs> men of this latter class remained with the <rs>North</rs>, because they could not obtain the positions they desired in the <rs>South</rs>; and afterward, as is the fashion with renegades, became more bitter against their own people than even the <rs>Northern</rs> men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Civil war is a terrible crucible through which to pass character; the dross drops away from the pure metal at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> touch of the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It must be admitted, indeed, that there was some little nerve required, on the part of an officer of the regular Army, or Navy, to elect to go with his State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>His profession was his only fortune; he depended upon it, for the means of subsisting himself and family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>If he remained where he was, a competency for life, and promotion, and honors probably awaited him; if he went with the <rs>South</rs>, a dark, and uncertain future was before him; he could not possibly better his condition, and if the <rs>South</rs> failed, he would have thrown away the labor of a life-time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>The struggle was hard in other respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>All professions are clannish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Men naturally cling <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> together, who have been bred to a common pursuit; and this remark is particularly applicable to the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, and the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/><placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> were powerful bonds to knit together the hearts of young men. Friendships were there formed, which it was difficult to sever, especially when strengthened by years of after-association, in common toils, common pleasures, and common dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Naval officers, in particular, who had been rocked together in the same storm, and had escaped perhaps from the same shipwreck, found it very difficult to draw their swords against each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The flag, too, had a charm which it was difficult to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>It had long been the emblem of the principle that all just governments are founded on the consent of the governed, vindicated against our <name>British</name> ancestors, in the <rs>War</rs> of the <name>Revolution</name>, and it was difficult to realize the fact that it no longer represented this principle, but had become the emblem of its opposite; that of coercing unwilling States, to remain under a Government, which they deemed unjust and oppressive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Sentiment had almost as much to do with the matter, as principle, for there clustered around the <q direct="unspecified">old flag,</q> a great many hallowed memories, of sacrifices made, and victories won.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The cadet at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> had marched and countermarched under its folds, dreaming of future battle-fields, and future honors to be gained in upholding and defending it; and the midshipman, as he gazed upon it, in some foreign port, flying proudly from the gaff-end of his ship, had drunk in new inspiration to do and to dare, for his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Many bearded men were affected almost to tears, as they saw this once hallowed emblem hauled down from the flag-staves, of Southern forts, and arsenals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>They were in the condition of <num value="1">one</num> who had been forced, in spite of himself, to realize the perfidy of a friend, and to be obliged to give him up, as no longer worthy of his confidence or affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Now we are in a state of war which will yield to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>In the winter of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, I was stationed in the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, as the <rs>Secretary</rs> of the <rs>Lighthouse Board</rs>, being then a commander in the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>I had long abandoned all hope of reconciliation between the sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The public mind, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, was in an angry mood, and the day of compromises was evidently at an end.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Although I had been born in the <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName>, and was reared on the banks of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>, I had been, for many years, a resident citizen of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, having removed to this State, in the year <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>, and settled with my family, on the west bank of the <placeName reg="Perdido River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2575827">Perdido</placeName>; removing thence, in a few years, to <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>My wife, with the instincts of a woman, a wife, and a mother, seemed to realize, as by intuition, all the dangers and difficulties that lay before me. She had been hoping without hope, that I would not be subjected to the bitter ordeal, but the die was now cast, and with a few tears, and many prayers she nerved herself for the sacrifices, and trials that she knew were before her. Her children were to be withdrawn from school, her comfortable home broken up, and she was to return, penniless, to her people, to abide with them the fortunes of a bloody, and a doubtful war. The heroism of woman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>how infinitely it surpasses that of man. With all her gentleness, and tenderness, and natural timidity, in <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> in <num value="10">ten</num>, she has more nerve than the other sex, in times of great emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>With a bleeding and bursting heart, she is capable of putting on the composure, and lovely serenity of an angel, binding up the wounds of a husband or son, and when he is restored to health and vigor, buckling on his sword anew, and returning him to the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The presence of these gentlemen in the <name>Board</name> may account for the fact, that my letter was not even honored with an acknowledgment of its receipt.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>I have said that there was no talk at this time, about traitors, and treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The reader will observe how openly, and as a matter of course, all these transactions were conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The seceded States had been several months in getting their Conventions together, and repealing, with all due form, and ceremony, the ordinances by which the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> had been accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/><rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, and members of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> had withdrawn from their seats, under circumstances unusually solemn, and impressive, which had attracted the attention of the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/><persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0007.00078.00143" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, in particular, had taken leave of a full Senate, with crowded galleries, in a speech of great dignity and power, in the course of which he said: <q direct="unspecified">We will invoke the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of our Fathers, who delivered them from the power of the <rs>Lion</rs>, to protect us from the ravages of the <rs>Bear</rs>; and thus putting our trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and in our own firm hearts, and strong arms, we will vindicate the right as best we may.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/></p> 
<p>As the resignation of each officer of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>, and Navy went in, it was well understood what his object was, and yet we have seen, that up to this period, the <rs>Government</rs> accepted them all, and permitted the officers to depart to their respective States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>It was not known, as yet, to what extent the disintegration might go, and it was not safe therefore to talk of treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/><q direct="unspecified">The wayward sisters</q> might decide to go in a body, in which event it would not have been <hi rend="italics">policy</hi> to attempt to prevent them, or to discuss questions of treason with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> did not think of arresting me, for telegraphing to the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName>, that I would be with it, immediately; nor did he, though he knew my purpose of drawing my sword against the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, if necessary, refuse to accept my resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Nay, <persName n="Buchanan,President,,,," id="n0133.0007.00078.00144" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> had decided that he had no power under the <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> Federal Constitution, to coerce a State; though, like a weak old man as he had now become, he involved himself afterward in the inconsistency of attempting to hold possession of the ceded places within the limits of the <name>States</name> which had with drawn from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>It could not but follow, logically, from the premise, that there was no power in the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> to coerce a State, that the <rs>State</rs> had the right to secede; for clearly any <num value="1">one</num> may do that which no <num value="1">one</num> has the right to prevent him from doing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>It was under such circumstances as these, that I dissolved my connection with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and returned to the condition of a private citizen, with no more obligation resting upon me, than upon any other citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>The Federal Government, itself, had formally released me from the contract of service I had entered into with it, and, as a matter of course, from the binding obligation of any oath I had taken in connection with that contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>All this was done, as the reader has seen, before I moved a step from the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>; and yet a subsequent <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, <persName n="Welles,Mister,Gideon,,," id="n0133.0007.00079.00145" reg="default:Welles,Gideon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Gideon</foreName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName>, has had the hardihood and indecency of accusing me of having been a <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">deserter</hi> from the service.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>He has deliberately put this false accusation on record, in a public document, in face of the facts I have stated&mdash;all of which were recorded upon the rolls of his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>I do not speak here of the clap-trap he has used about <q direct="unspecified">treason to the flag,</q> and the other stale nonsense which he has uttered in connection with my name, for this was common enough among his countrymen, and was perhaps to have been expected from men smarting under the castigation I had given them, but of the more definite and explicit charge, of <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">deserting from the service</hi>,</q> when the service, itself, as he well knew, had released me from all my obligations to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Another charge, with as little foundation, has been made against myself, and other officers of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, who resigned their commissions, and came South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>It has been said that we were in the condition of <hi rend="italics">&eacute;lves</hi> of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, inasmuch as we had received our education at the military schools, and that we were guilty of ingratitude to that Government, when we withdrew from its service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>This slander has no doubt had its effect, with the ignorant masses, but <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> it can scarcely have been entertained by any <num value="1">one</num> who has a just conception of the nature of our federal system of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>It loses sight of the fact, that the <name>States</name> are the creators, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> the creature; that not only the military schools, but the <rs>Federal Government</rs> itself belongs to the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Whence came the fund for the establishment of these schools?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>From the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>In what proportion did the <name>States</name> contribute it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/><persName n="Benton,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0007.00080.00146" reg="mostcommon:Benton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benton</surname></persName> has answered this question, as the reader has seen, when he was discussing the effect of the tariffs under which the <rs>South</rs> had so long been depleted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>He has told us, that <num value="4">four</num> States alone, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the <num value="2">two</num> Carolinas and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, defrayed <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the expenses of the <rs>General Government</rs>; and taking the whole <rs>South</rs> into view, this proportion had even increased since his day, up to the breaking out of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Of every appropriation, then, that was made by Congress for the support of the military schools, <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the money belonged to the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Did these States send <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the students to those schools?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Of course not &mdash;this would have been something like justice to them; but justice to the <rs>Southern States</rs> was no part of the scheme of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>With the exception of a few cadets, and midshipmen <q direct="unspecified">at large,</q> whom the <rs>President</rs> was authorized to appoint&mdash;the intention being that he should appoint the sons of deceased officers of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy, but the fact being that he generally gave the appointment to his political friends &mdash;the appointments to these schools were made from the several States, in proportion to population, and as a matter of course, the <rs>North</rs> got the lion's share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>But supposing the <name>States</name> to have been equally represented in those schools, what would have been the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Why, simply that the <rs>South</rs> not only educated her own boys, but educated <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> boys, to boot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>It was easy to see, that the great majority of the people were with the extreme <rs>South</rs>, in this her hour of need, but there were some time-servers and trimmers, who still talked of conciliation, and of guarantees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>They inquired eagerly after news from <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, at all the stations at which the train stopped, and seemed disappointed when they found we had nothing more to tell them, than they had already learned through the telegraph.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>On the evening of the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, I entered the level tract of pine lands between <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n0133.0008.00081.00150" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>The air had become soft, and balmy, though I had left a region of frosts, and snow, only <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>The pine woods were on fire as we passed through them, the flames now and then running up a lightwood tree, and throwing a weird and fitful glare upon the passing train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>The scene was peculiarly Southern, and reminded me that I was drawing near my home, and my people, and I mechanically repeated to myself the words of the poet: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Under this happy influence I sank, as the night advanced, and the train thundered on, into the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sound sleep which had visited my weary eyelids, since I had resigned my commission, and read at the foot of the letter accepting my resignation, my name inscribed as plain <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role">Esq.</rs></q> This night-ride, through the burning pine woods of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, afterward stood as a great gulf in my memory, forming an impassable barrier, as it were, between my past, and my future life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>It had cost me pain to cross the gulf, but once crossed, I never turned to look back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> realized the greatness of the crisis that was upon us, and hence the very best men in the community had been selected to meet the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>He received me kindly, and almost the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question which he asked me, was whether I had disembarrassed myself of my Federal commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>He seemed gratified at this declaration, and entered into a free, and frank conversation with me, on the subject of the want of preparation for defence, in which he found our States, and the great labor that lay before us, to prepare for emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Congress, he said, has not yet had time to organize a navy, but he designed to make immediate use of me, if I had no objection.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>The next morning I called again on the <rs>President</rs>, received my instructions, and departed Northward on the mission which had been assigned me. I will be brief in the description of this mission also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>I stopped a day at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and examined the <orgName n="State Arsenal" type="arsenal">State Arsenal</orgName>, in charge of <persName n="Dimmock,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0008.00084.00177" reg="mostcommon:Dimmock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Dimmock</surname></persName>, and the <orgName n="Tredegar Iron Works" type="works">Tredegar Iron Works</orgName>; having been especially enjoined to report upon the present, and future capacity of these works for the casting of cannon, shot, shells, &amp;c.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Reaching <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> again, I visited the <name>Arsenal</name>, and inspected such of its machinery as I thought worth my notice, particularly an improved percussion-cap machine which I found in operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>I also held conferences with some <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> mechanics, whom I desired to induce to go South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Being purely a sectional <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and feeling probably that he had no just right to rule over the <rs>South</rs>, he had come into the city by night, and in disguise, afraid to trust himself among a people of whom he claimed to be <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>He had been gathering together troops for some days, in the <rs>Federal</rs> capital, for the purpose of inaugurating, amid bayonets, a President of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>It had been the boast of the <rs>American</rs> people, heretofore, that their <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> did not need guards, but trusted wholly for their security, to the love, and confidence of their constituents, but the reign of peace, and good will was at an end, and the reign of the bayonet was to ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The rumbling of artillery through the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and the ring of grounded arms on the pavements, had sounded the death-knell of liberty in these States for generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Swarms of visitors from far and near, in the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name>, had flocked to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, to see <hi rend="italics">their</hi> <rs type="role2">President</rs> inaugurated, and were proud of this spectacle of arms; too stupid to see its fearful significance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>The auspicious day, the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, at length arrived, and whilst the glorious pageant is being prepared; whilst the windows and the house-tops along <address><street n="Pennsylvania Avenue">Pennsylvania Avenue</street></address> are being thronged with a motley population of men and women, come to see the show; whilst the <rs type="role" reg="President elect">President elect</rs>, in a hollow square of bayonets, is marching toward the <rs>Capitol</rs>, the writer of these pages, having again taken leave of his family, was hurrying away from the desecration of a capital, which had been ceded by a too credulous <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and which had been laid out by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0133.0008.00085.00181" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>As I left the <rs type="place">Baltimore depot</rs>, extra trains were still pouring their <num value="1000">thousands</num> into the streets of <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>I found the people everywhere, not only willing, but anxious to contract with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>I made contracts for batteries of <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName>, powder, and other munitions, and succeeded in getting large quantities of the powder shipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>It was agreed between the contractors and myself, that when I should have occasion to use the telegraph, certain other words were to be substituted, for those of military import, to avoid suspicion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>I made a contract, conditioned upon the approval of my Government, for the removal to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, of a complete set of machinery for rifling cannon, with the requisite skilled workmen to put it in operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Some of these men, who would thus have sold body, and soul to me, for a sufficient consideration, occupied high social positions, and were men of wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>I dined with them, at their comfortable residences near their factories, where the music of boring out cannon, accompanied the clatter of the dishes, and the popping of champagne-corks; and I had more than <num value="1">one</num> business interview with gentlemen, who occupied the most costly suites of apartments at the <rs type="place">Astor House</rs> in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York City</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Many of these gentlemen, being unable to carry out their contracts with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> because of the prompt breaking out of the war, afterward obtained lucrative contracts from the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and became, in consequence, intensely <hi rend="italics">loyal</hi>. It would be a <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi> breach of honor to disclose their names, as they dealt with me, pretty much as conspirators against their government are wont to deal with the enemies of their government, secretly, and with an implied confidence that I would keep their secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>It is accordingly safe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>In the mean time, the great revolution was progressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>The Northern public was evidently puzzled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>It had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rather treated secession as a joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>They did not think it possible that the <rs>Southern</rs> people could be in earnest, in dissolving their connection with a people, so emniently proper as themselves; but they now began to waver in this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>The very men who had stood, shoulder to shoulder, with us, in resisting Northern aggression, who had encouraged us with pen, and voice, to resist, if need be, unto the death, who promised in case of secession, to stand between us, and the march of Northern armies of invasion, instantly, and <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> without even the salvo to their consciences of circumlocution, changed their political faith of a life-time, and became, if not straight-out Republicans, at least blatant War Democrats.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>The reader cannot be at a loss to account for this change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>It was caused by the purest, and most refined selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Next to the love of wealth, the love of office may be said to be the distinguishing passion of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>In the hands of a skilful office-seeker, patriotism is a mere word with which to delude the ignorant masses, and not a sentiment, or a creed, to be really entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>Their motto, on the contrary, became <hi rend="italics">sauve qui peut</hi>, and the d&mdash;l take the hindmost; and the banks of the new political <persName n="Jordan,,,,," id="n0133.0009.00091.00191" reg="mostcommon:Jordan,nomatch:0"><surname>Jordan</surname></persName> were at once crowded with a multitude anxious to be dipped in its regenerating waters!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>I at once sought an interview with the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, and explained to him my desire to go afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>We had, as yet, nothing that could be called a navy; not a ship indeed, if we except a few river steamers, that had been hastily armed by some of the <name>States</name>, and turned over, by them, to the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>The naval officers, who had come South, had brought with them nothing but their poverty, and their swords; all of them who had been in command of ships, at the secession of their respective States, having, from a sense of honor, delivered them back to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<p>If a sense of justice had presided at the separation of the <name>States</name>, a large portion of the ships of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> would have been turned over to the <rs>South</rs>; and this failing to be done, it may be questionable whether the <rs>Southern</rs> naval officers, in command, would not have been justified in bringing their ships with them, which it would have been easy for them to do. But, on the other hand, they had been personally intrusted with their commands, by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and it would have been treason to a military principle, if not to those great principles which guide revolutions, to deliver those commands to a different government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>Perhaps they decided correctly&mdash; at all events, a military, or naval man, cannot go very far astray, who abides by the point of honor.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Shortly before the war-cloud had arisen so ominously above the political horizon, I had written a letter to a distinguished member of the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> from the <rs>South</rs>, in reply to <num value="1">one</num> from himself, giving him my views as to the naval policy of our section, in case things should come to a crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>I make no apology to the reader for presenting him with the following extract from that letter, bearing upon the subject, which we have now in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/><q direct="unspecified">You ask me to explain what I mean, by an irregular naval force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>I mean a well-organized system of private armed ships, called privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>If you are warred upon at all, it will be by a commercial people, whose ability to do you harm will consist chiefly in ships, and shipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>It is at ships and shipping, therefore, that you must strike; and the most effectual way to do this, is, by means of the irregular force of which I speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/><rs type="role2">Private</rs> cupidity will always furnish the means for this description of warfare, and all that will be required of you will be to put it under sufficient legal restraints, to prevent it from degenerating into piracy, and becoming an abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>The system of privateering would be analogous to the militia system on the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>You could have a large irregular sea force, to act in aid of the regular naval force, so long as the war lasted, and which could be disbanded, without further care or expense, at the end of the war.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/></p> 
<p>Wealth is necessary to the conduct of all modern wars, and <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> I naturally turned my eyes, as indicated in the above letter, to the enemy's chief source of wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The ingenuity, enterprise, and natural adaptation of the <rs>Northern</rs> people to the sea, and seafaring pursuits, had enabled them, aided by the vast resources, which they had filched, under pretence of legislation, from the <rs>South</rs>, to build up, in the course of a very few years, a commercial marine that was <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only to that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in magnitude and importance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> decked vessel that had been built in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was built by <num value="1">one</num> Adrian Block, a Dutch skipper, on the banks of the <placeName reg="Hudson River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7013729">Hudson</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1614--"><year reg="1614">1614</year></dateStruct>, and in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, or in less than <measure n="2.5centuries" type="date">two centuries and a half</measure>, the great Republic was competing with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the history of whose maritime enterprise extended back a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>, for, the carrying trade of the world I This trade, if permitted to continue, would be a powerful means of sustaining the credit of the enemy, and enabling him to carry on the war. Hence it became an object of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> necessity with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to strike at his commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>I enlarged upon this necessity, in the interview I was now holding with <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0009.00093.00193" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,Stephen,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, and I was gratified to find that that able officer agreed with me fully in opinion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>A Board of naval officers was already in session at New Orleans, charged with the duty of procuring, as speedily as possible, some light and fast steamers to be let loose against the enemy's commercial marine, but their reports up to this time, had been but little satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>They had examined a number of vessels, and found some defects in all of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs>, speaking of the discouragement presented by these reports, handed me <num value="1">one</num> of them, which he had received that morning, from the <name>Board</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>I read it, and found that it described a small propeller steamer, of <num value="500">five hundred</num> tons burden, sea-going, with a low-pressure engine, sound, and capable of being so strengthened as to be enabled to carry an ordinary battery of <num value="4">four</num>, or <num value="5">five</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Her speed was reported to be between <num value="9">nine</num>, and <num value="10">ten</num> knots, but unfortunately, said the <name>Board</name>, she carries but <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> fuel, and has no accommodations for the crew of a ship of war. She was, accordingly, condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>When I had finished reading the report, I turned to the <rs>Secretary</rs>, and said, <q direct="unspecified">Give me that ship; I think I can <pb id="p.94" n="94"/> make her answer the purpose.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>My request was at once acceded to, the <rs>Secretary</rs> telegraphed to the <name>Board</name>, to receive the ship, and the clerks of the <name>Department</name> were set at work, to hunt up the necessary officers, to accompany me, and make out the proper orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>The long lines of shipping above the city had been greatly thinned, and a general air of desolation hung over the river front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>I was sometimes detained at the ferry-house, waiting for the ferry-boat, and on these occasions, casting my eyes up and down the late busy river, it was not unfrequent to see it without so much as a skiff in motion on its bosom.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>But this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> simoon of the desert which had swept over the city, as a foretaste of what was to come, had by no means discouraged its patriotic inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> took the lead, and declared a strict neutrality between the combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>It was of the essence of such a declaration, that it should put both belligerents on the same footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>This was apparently done, and the cruisers of both sections were prohibited, alike, from taking their prizes into <name>British</name> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>I shall have something to say of the unequal operation of this declaration of neutrality, in a future part of these memoirs; for the present it is only necessary to state, that it acknowledged us to be in possession of belligerent rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>This was a point gained certainly, but it was no more than was to have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>Indeed, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> could do nothing less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>But the truth would not be suppressed, and when, at last, it became necessary to declare the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports in a state of blockade, and to send ships of war thither, to enforce the declaration, the sly little game which they had been playing was all up with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>A blockade was an act of war, which came under the cognizance of the laws of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>It concerned neutrals, as well as belligerents, and foreign nations were bound to take notice of it. It followed that there could not be a blockade without a war; and it equally followed, that there could not be a war without at least <num value="2">two</num> belligerent parties <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> to it. It will thus be seen, that the declaration of neutrality of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was a logical sequence of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0010.00101.00218" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:8"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s, and <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0010.00101.00219" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s own act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>So much was this act considered, as a matter of course, at the time, that all the other powers of the earth, of sufficient dignity to act in the premises, at all, followed the example set them by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and issued similar declarations; and the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of bloody war that followed justified the wisdom of their acts.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>We had masts, and sails, it is true, but these could be of but little use, when the coal was exhausted, as the propeller would remain a drag in the water, there being no means of hoisting it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>The reader will see, as we progress, that I gave the <q direct="unspecified">implicit obedience</q> which had been promised, to these instructions, and that if greater results were not accomplished, it was the fault of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, and not of her commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>In the same letter that brought me my sailing orders, the <rs>Secretary</rs> had suggested to me the propriety of adopting some means of communicating with him, by cipher, so that, my despatches, if captured by the enemy, would be unintelligible to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>At present the worst feature of the blockade of Pass &agrave; L'Outre is, that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName></hi> has the speed of me; so that even if I should run the bar, I could not hope to escape her, unless I surprised her, which with her close watch of the bar, at anchor near by, both night and day, it will be exceedingly difficult to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>In nightly expectation of an assault, I directed the engineer to keep the water in his boilers, as near the steam-point as possible, without actually generating the vapor, and sent a patrol of boats some distance down the <placeName reg="Southwest, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,4010660">Southwest</placeName> Pass; the boats being relieved every <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, and returning to the ship, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> streaks of dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>With disappointed hopes we had nothing to do, but to return to our anchors, and watch and wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>In half an hour more, the sailors were lounging idly about the decks, under well spread awnings; the jest, and banter went round, as usual, and save the low hissing and singing of the <pb id="p.114" n="114"/> steam, which was still escaping, there was nothing to remind the beholder of our recent disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>It was a bright <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and we were thinking of nothing but the usual muster, and how we should get through another idle day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>The men ran round the capstan, in <q direct="unspecified">doublequick,</q> in their eagerness to get up the anchor, and in a few minutes more, the ship's head swung off gracefully with the current, and, the propeller being started, she bounded off like a thing of life, on this new race, which was to decide whether we should continue to stagnate in midsummer, in the marshes of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, or reach those <q direct="unspecified">glad waters of the dark blue sea,</q> which form as delightful a picture in the imagination of the sailor, as in that of the poet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Whilst we were heaving up our anchor, I had noticed the pilot, standing near me, pale, and apparently nervous, and agitated, but, as yet, he had said not a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>When we were fairly under way, however, and it seemed probable, at last, that we should attempt the blockade, the fellow's courage fairly broke down, and he protested to me that he knew nothing of <pb id="p.115" n="115"/> the bar of Pass &agrave; L'Outre, and durst not attempt to run me over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>The fellow stammered out something in excuse, but I was too impatient to listen to him, arid, turning to the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">first lieutenant</rs>, ordered him to hoist the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0011.00115.00264" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName></q> at the fore, as a signal for a pilot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/>I had, in fact, resolved to attempt the passage of the bar, from my own slight acquaintance with it, when I had been a light-house inspector, rather than forego the opportunity of escape, and caused the <name>Jack</name> to be hoisted, rather as a matter of course, than because I hoped for any good result from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>We had nearly equal distances to run to the bar, but I had the advantage of a <num value="4">four</num>-knot current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/><pb id="p.116" n="116"/></p> 
<p>Here the conversation dropped, for an officer now came to report to me that a boat had just shoved off from the pilots' station, evidently with a pilot in her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>But more beautiful still was another object which presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>In the balcony of the pilot's house, which had been built in the very marsh, on the margin of the river, there stood a beautiful woman, the pilot's young wife waving him on to his duty, with her handkerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>We could have tossed a biscuit from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> to the shore, and I uncovered my head gallantly to my fair countrywoman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>A few moments more, and a tow-line had been thrown to the boat, and the gallant young fellow stood on the horse-block beside me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1123"/>As we swept past the light-house wharf, almost close enough to touch it, there were other petticoats fluttering in the breeze, the owners of which were also waving handkerchiefs of encouragement to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>. I could see my sailors' eyes brighten at these spectacles, for the sailor's heart is capacious enough to love the whole sex, and I now felt sure of their nerves, in case it should become necessary to tax them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>Half a mile or so, from the light-house, and the bar is reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>There was a Bremen ship lying aground on the bar, and there was just room, and no more, for us to pass her. She had run out a kedge, and had a warp attached to it that was lying across the passage-way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1132"/>I called a lieutenant, and directed him to heave the log. He reported our speed to be <num value="9">nine</num>, and <num value="0.5">a half</num> knots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/>Loth to believe that we could be making so little way, through the yet turbid waters, which were rushing past us with great apparent velocity, I directed the officer to repeat the experiment; but the same result followed, though he had paid out the line with a free hand.

<p>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName></hi> soon loosed, and set her sails, bracing them sharp up on the starboard tack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>I loosed and set mine, also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>The enemy's ship was a little on my weather quarter, say a couple of points, and had thus slightly the weather-gauge of me. As I knew I could lay nearer the wind than she, being able to brace my yards sharper, and had besides, the advantage of larger fore-and-aft sails, comparatively, stay-sails, trysails, and a very large spanker, I resolved at once to hold my wind, so closely, as to compel her to furl her sails, though this would carry me a little athwart her bows, and bring me perhaps a little nearer to her, for the next half hour, or so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>I could not but admire the majesty of her appearance, with her broad flaring bows, and clean, and beautiful run, and her masts, and yards, as taunt and square, as those of an old time sailing frigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>The stars and stripes of a large ensign flew out from time to time, from under the lee of her spanker, and we could see an apparently anxious crowd of officers on her quarter deck, many of them with telescopes directed toward us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>As I leaned on the carriage of a howitzer on the poop of my ship, and cast a glance toward the quarter of the horizon whence the land had disappeared, memory was busy with the events of the last few months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>How hurried, and confused they had been!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>It seemed as though I had dreamed a dream, and found it difficult, upon waking, to unite the discordant parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>We may now take up our narrative, from the point at which it was interrupted, for the purpose of these introductions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>Day passed into night, and with the night came the brilliant comet again, lighting us on our way over the waste of waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>At <time value="8am">eight A. M.</time> we struck the north-east trade-wind, and made sail in aid of steam, giving orders to the engineer, to make the most of his fuel, by carrying only a moderate head of steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>Toward <pb id="p.126" n="126"/> noon, a few trade squalls passed over us, with light and refreshing showers of rain; just enough to cause me to take shelter, for a few moments, under the lee of the spanker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time>, we observed in latitude <num value="23">23</num>&deg; <num value="4">4</num>&prime; showing that we had crossed the tropic&mdash;the longitude being <num value="86">86</num>&deg; <num value="13">13</num>&prime;.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1258"/>A gun soon brought these to the peak; when, as I had expected, the stars and stripes unfolded themselves, gracefully, to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>Here was our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prize, and a most welcome sight it was.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1260"/>The <q direct="unspecified">old flag,</q> which I had been accustomed to worship, in my youth, had a criminal look, in my eyes, as it ascended to the peak of that ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1261"/>How strangely we sometimes invest mere inanimate things with the attributes of life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1262"/>When I had fired the gun, as a command to the stranger to heave to, and show his colors, I had hauled down the <rs>English</rs>, and hoisted my own flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1263"/>The stars and stripes seemed now to look abashed in the presence of the new banner of the <rs>South</rs>; pretty much as a burglar might be supposed to look, who had been caught in the act of breaking into a gentleman's house; but then the burglar was my relative, and had erst been my friend&mdash;how could I fail to feel some pity for him, along with the indignation, which his crime had excited?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>The boarding officer soon returned from the captured ship, bringing with him the master, with his papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>There were no knotty points of fact or law to embarrass my decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1266"/>There were the <rs>American</rs> register, and clearance, and the <rs>American</rs> character impressed upon every plank and spar of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>Nothing could exceed the astonishment of the master, who was rather a mild, amiable-looking gentleman, not at all disposed to go either into hysterics, or the heroics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1268"/><q direct="unspecified">A clap of thunder in a cloudless sky could not <pb id="p.128" n="128"/> have surprised me more,</q> said he to me as I overhauled his papers, <q direct="unspecified">than the appearance of the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag in these seas.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1270"/>The prize bore the name of <hi rend="italics">The Golden Rocket</hi>, was a fine bark, nearly new, of about <num value="700">seven hundred</num> tons, and was seeking, in ballast, a cargo of sugar in some <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Cuban</name> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>Boats were dispatched to bring off the crew, and such provisions, cordage, sails, and paints as the different departments of my ship stood in need of, and at about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> at night, the order was given to apply the torch to her.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>The wind, by this time, had become very light, and the night was pitch-dark&mdash;the darkness being of that kind, graphically described by old sailors, when they say, you may cut it with a knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>I regret that I cannot give to the reader the picture of the burning ship, as it presented itself to the silent, and solemn watchers on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> as they leaned over her hammock rails to witness it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>Suddenly, <num value="1">one</num> of the crew exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">There is the flame She is on fire!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1275"/>The decks of this <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>-built ship were of pine, calked with old-fashioned oakum, and paid with pitch; the wood-work of the cabin was like so much tinder, having been seasoned by many voyages to the tropics, and the forecastle was stowed with paints, and oils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1276"/>The consequence was, that the flame was not long in kindling, but leaped, full-grown, into the air, in a very few minutes after its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faint glimmer had been seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1277"/>The boarding officer, to do his work more effectually, had applied <pb id="p.129" n="129"/> the torch simultaneously in <num value="3">three</num> places, the cabin, the mainhold, and the forecastle; and now the devouring flames rushed up these <num value="3">three</num> apertures, with a fury which nothing could resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1279"/>The indraught into the burning ship's holds, and cabins, added every moment new fury to the flames, and now they could be heard roaring like the fires of a <num value="100">hundred</num> furnaces, in full blast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>The prize ship had been laid to, with her main-topsail to the mast, and all her light sails, though clewed up, were flying loose about the yards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1281"/>The forked tongues of the devouring element, leaping into the rigging, newly tarred, ran rapidly up the shrouds, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> into the tops, then to the topmast-heads, thence to the topgallant, and royal mast-heads, and in a moment more to the trucks; and whilst this rapid ascent of the main current of fire was going on, other currents had run out upon the yards, and ignited all the sails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1282"/>A top-gallant sail, all on fire, would now fly off from the yard, and sailing leisurely in the direction of the light breeze that was fanning, rather than blowing, break into bright, and sparkling patches of flame, and settle, or rather silt into the sea. The yard would then follow, and not being wholly submerged by its descent into the sea, would retain a portion of its flame, and continue to burn, as a floating brand, for some minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1283"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time, the intricate net-work of the cordage of the burning ship was traced, as with a pencil of fire, upon the black sky beyond, the many threads of flame twisting, and writhing, like so many serpents that had received their death wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1284"/>The mizzen-mast now went by the board, then the fore-mast, and in a few minutes afterward, the great main-mast tottered, reeled, and fell over the ship's side into the sea, making a noise like that of the sturdy oak of the forests when it falls by the stroke of the axeman</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1290"/>It was the especial pride of this veteran American seaman to count over his trophies, and when the weather was fine, he invariably asked permission of the officer of the deck, under pretence of damage from moths, to <q direct="unspecified">air</q> his flags; and as he would bend on his signalhalliards, and throw them out to the breeze, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, his old eye would glisten, and a grim smile of satisfaction would settle upon his sun-burned, and weather-beaten features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>We burned the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Rocket,,Golden,,," id="n0133.0013.00132.00289" reg="default:Rocket,Golden,,,"><foreName>Golden</foreName> <surname>Rocket</surname></persName></hi>, as has been seen, on the <dateStruct value="-07-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>The next day was the <q direct="unspecified">glorious <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num></q>&mdash; once glorious, indeed, as the day on which a people broke the chains of a government which had bound them against their will, and vindicated the principle of self-government as an <hi rend="italics">inalienable</hi> right; but since desecrated by the same people, who have scorned, and spat upon the record made by their fathers, and repudiated, as a heresy fraught with the penalties of treason, the inalienable right for which their fathers struggled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>The grand old day belonged, of right, to us of the <rs>South</rs>, for we still venerated it, as hallowed by our fathers, and were engaged in a <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num></hi> revolution, to uphold, and defend the doctrines which had been proclaimed in the <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num></hi>, but we failed to celebrate it on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>. We could not help associating it with the <q direct="unspecified">old flag,</q> which had now become a sham and a deceit; with the wholesale robberies which had been committed upon our property, and with the villification and abuse which had been heaped upon our persons by our late co-partners, for a generation and more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> had proved to be a specious mask, under which our loving brethren of the <rs>North</rs> had contrived to draw us into a co-partnership with them, that they might be the better enabled, in the end, to devour us. How could we respect it, in such a connection?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>Accordingly, the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> was not invited to dine in the ward-room, on the time-honored day, nor was there any extra glass of grog served to the crew, as had been the custom in the old service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>The weather still continued cloudy, with a few rain squalls <pb id="p.133" n="133"/> passing with the trade wind, during the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>I had turned into my cot, late on the previous night, and was still sleeping soundly, when, at daylight, an officer came below to inform me, that there were <num value="2">two</num> sails in sight from the masthead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1305"/>We were steaming, as before, up the south side of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, with the land plainly in sight, and soon came close enough to distinguish that the vessels ahead were both brigantines, and probably <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0133.0013.00133.00290" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>There being no occasion to resort to <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi>, or stratagem, as the wind was light, and there was no possibility of the ships running away from us, we showed them at once the <rs>Confederate</rs> colors, and at the same time fired a blank cartridge to heave them to. They obeyed our signal, promptly, and came to the wind, with their foretopsails aback, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors at their peaks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>When within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, we stopped our engine, and lowered, and sent a boat on board of them&mdash;the boarding officer remaining only a few minutes on board of each, and bringing back with him, their respective masters, with their ships' papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1308"/>Upon examination of these, it appeared that <num value="1">one</num> of the brigantines was called the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName></hi>, and the other the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2045112" n="1.000 5" reg="machias, washington, maine">Machias</placeName>;</hi> that they were both laden with sugar and molasses, for <name>English</name> ports, and that they had recently come out of the port of Trinidad-de-Cuba.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1309"/>Indeed the recency of their sailing was tested, by the way in which their stern-boats were garlanded, with festoons of luscious bananas, and pine-apples, and by sundry nets filled with golden-hued oranges&mdash;all of which was very tempting to the eyes and olfactories of men, who had recently issued from a blockaded port, in which such luxuries were tabooed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>The cargoes of these small vessels being neutral, as certified by the papers&mdash;and indeed of this there could be little doubt, as they were going from <num value="1">one</num> neutral port to another&mdash;I could not burn the vessels as I had done the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Rocket,,Golden,,," id="n0133.0013.00133.00291" reg="default:Rocket,Golden,,,"><foreName>Golden</foreName> <surname>Rocket</surname></persName></hi>, and so after transferring prize crews to them, which occupied us an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, we took them both in tow, and steamed away for <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>&mdash;it being my intention to test the disposition of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> toward us, in this matter of taking in prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1311"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> had issued proclamations, prohibiting both belligerents, alike, from bringing prizes into their ports, but <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> had not yet spoken, and <pb id="p.134" n="134"/> I had hopes that she might be induced to pursue a different course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1312"/>Nothing worthy of note occurred during the rest of this day; we steamed leisurely along the coast, making about <num value="5">five</num> knots an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1313"/>Finding our speed too much diminished, by the towage of <num value="2">two</num> heavily laden vessels, we cast off <num value="1">one</num> of them&mdash;the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName></hi>&mdash;during the night and directed the prizemaster to make sail, and follow us into port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1314"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName></hi> did not rejoin us, and we afterward learned through the medium of the enemy's papers, that she had been recaptured by her crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1315"/>I had only sent a midshipman and <num value="4">four</num> men on board of her as a prize crew; and the midshipman incautiously going aloft, to look out for the land, as he was approaching his port, and a portion of his prize crew proving treacherous&mdash; they were not native <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0133.0013.00134.00292" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> I am glad to say&mdash;he was fired upon by the master, and crew of the brig, who had gotten possession of the revolvers of the prize crew, and compelled to surrender, after defending himself the best he could, and being wounded in <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1316"/>The vessel then changed her course and made haste to get out of the <placeName reg="Caribbean Sea" key="tgn,7004569">Caribbean Sea</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>The morning of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> dawned cloudy, with the usual moderate trade-wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>It cleared toward noon, and at <time value="2pm">two P. M.</time> we crossed the shoal off the east end of the <hi rend="italics">Jardinillos</hi> reef, in from <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="5">five</num> fathoms of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>The sea, by this time, had become quite smooth, and the rays of a bright sun penetrated the clear waters to the very bottom of the shoal, revealing everything to us, as clearly as though the medium through which we were viewing it were atmosphere instead of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>Every rock, sea-shell, and pebble lying at the bottom of the sea were distinctly visible to us, and we could see the little fish darting into their holes, and hiding-places, as the steamer ploughed her way through their usually quiet domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>It was quite startling to look over the side, so shallow did the waters appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>The chart showed that there was no danger, and the faithful lead line, in the hands of a skilful seaman, gave us several fathoms of water to spare, and yet <num value="1">one</num> could hardly divest himself of the belief, that at the next moment the steamer would run aground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/><pb id="p.135" n="135"/></p> 
<p>Crossing this shoal, we now hauled up N. E. by N., for the <name>Cienfuegos</name> lighthouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>As we approached the lights, we descried <num value="2">two</num> more sail in the south-east, making an offing with all diligence, to which we immediately gave chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>They were <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles distant</measure> from the land, and to facilitate our pursuit, we cast off our remaining tow, directing the prizemaster to heave to, off the lighthouse, and await our return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>We had already <measure n="3" type="captured">captured three</measure> prizes, in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, and, as here were probably <num value="2">two</num> more, I could perceive that my crew were becoming enamoured of their business, pretty much as the veteran fox-hunter does in view of the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>They moved about with great alacrity, in obedience to orders; the seamen springing aloft to furl the sails like so many squirrels, and the firemen below sending up thick volumes of black smoke, from their furnaces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, feeling the renewed impulse of her engines, sprang forward in pursuit of the doomed craft ahead, as if she too knew what was going on. We had just daylight enough left to enable us to accomplish our purpose; an hour or <num value="2">two</num> later, and at least <num value="1">one</num> of the vessels might have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Coming up, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with <num value="1">one</num>, and then the other, we hove them to, successively, by <q direct="unspecified">hail,</q> and brought the masters on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>They both proved to be brigantines, and were American, as we had supposed:&mdash;<num value="1">one</num>, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Dunning,,Benjamin,,," id="n0133.0013.00135.00293" reg="default:Dunning,Benjamin,,,"><foreName n="Benjamin">Ben.</foreName> <surname>Dunning</surname></persName></hi>, of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, and the other, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Adams,,Albert,,," id="n0133.0013.00135.00294" reg="default:Adams,Albert,,,"><foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName></hi>, of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>They had come out of the port of <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, only a few hours before, were both sugar laden, and their cargoes were documented as Spanish property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>We hastily threw prize crews on board of them, and directed the prize masters to stand in for the light, still in sight, distant about <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure>, and hold on to it until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>It was now about <time value="10pm">ten P. M.</time> Some appeal was made to me by the master of <num value="1">one</num> of the brigantines, in behalf of his wife and a lady companion of hers, who were both invalids from the effects of yellow fever, which they had taken in <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, and from which they were just convalescing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>I desired him to assure the ladies, that they should be treated with every tenderness, and respect, and that if they desired it, I would send my surgeon to visit them; but I declined to release the captured vessel on this account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/><pb id="p.136" n="136"/></p> 
<p>We now stood in for the light ourselves, and letting our steam go down, to the lowest point consistent with locomotion, lay off, and on, until daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>The next morning dawned beautiful, and bright, as a tropic morning only can dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1337"/>We were close in under the land, and our prizes were lying around us, moving to and fro, gracefully, to preserve their positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1338"/>The most profuse, and luxuriant vegetation, of that peculiarly dark green known only to the tropics, ran down to the very water's edge; the beautiful little stream, on which <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName> lies, disembogued itself at the foot of the lighthouse perched on a base of blackened limestone rock; and the neat, white fort, that sat a mile or <num value="2">two</num> up the river, was now glistening in the rays of the sun, just lifting himself above the central range of mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>The sea breeze had died away during the night, and been replaced by the land breeze, in obedience to certain laws which prevail in all countries swept by the trade-winds; and this land breeze, blowing so gently, as scarce to disturb a tress on the brow of beauty, came laden with the most delicious perfume of shrub and flower.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>But, <q direct="unspecified">what smoke is that we perceive, coming down the river?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1341"/>said I, to the officer of the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1342"/><q direct="unspecified">I will see in a moment,</q> said this active young officer, and springing several ratlines up the rigging, to enable him to obtain a view over the intervening foliage, he said, <q direct="unspecified">There is a small steam-tug coming down, with <num value="3">three</num> vessels in tow, <num value="2">two</num> barks and a brig.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1343"/><q direct="unspecified">Can you make out the nationality of the ships in tow?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>I inquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1345"/><q direct="unspecified">Plainly,</q> he replied, <q direct="unspecified">they all have the <rs>American</rs> colors set.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1346"/>Here was a piece of unlooked &mdash; for good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1347"/>I had not reckoned upon carrying more than <num value="3">three</num>, or <num value="4">four</num> prizes into port, but here were <num value="3">three</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1348"/>But to secure these latter, a little management would be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1349"/>I could not molest them, within neutral jurisdiction, and the neutral jurisdiction extended to a marine league, or <num value="3">three</num> geographical miles from the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>I immediately hoisted a Spanish jack at the fore, as a signal for a pilot, and directed the officer of the deck, to disarrange his yards, a little, cock-billing this <num value="1">one</num>, slightly, in <num value="1">one</num> direction, and that <num value="1">one</num>, in another, and to send all but about a dozen men below, to give the strangers the idea that we were a common merchant steamer, instead of a ship <pb id="p.137" n="137"/> of war. To carry still further the illusion, we hoisted the <rs>Spanish</rs> merchant flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>But the real trouble was with the prizes&mdash;<num value="2">two</num> of these must surely be recognized by their companions of only the day before!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>Luckily my prize masters took the hint I had given them, and hoisted their respective flags, at the fore, for a pilot also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>This mystified the new-comers, and they concluded that the <num value="2">two</num> brigantines, though very like, could not be the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>Besides, there was <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> brigantine in company, and she evidently was a new arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>And so they came on, quite unsuspiciously, and when the little steamer had towed them clear of the mouth of the harbor, she let them go, and they made sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1356"/>The fellows worked very industriously, and soon had their ships under clouds of canvas, pressing them out to get an offing, before the sea breeze should come in. The steam-tug, as soon as she had let go her tows, came alongside the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, and a Spanish pilot jumped on board of me, asking me in his native tongue, if I desired to go up to town; showing that my ruse of the <rs>Spanish</rs> flag had even deceived him. I replied in the affirmative, and said to him, pleasantly, <q direct="unspecified">but I am waiting a little, to take back those ships you have just towed down.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1357"/><q direct="unspecified">Diablo!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1358"/>said he, <q direct="unspecified">how can that be; they are <hi rend="italics">Americanos del Norte</hi>, bound to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and <hi rend="italics">la <persName n="York,,Nueva,,," id="n0133.0013.00137.00295" reg="default:York,Nueva,,,"><foreName>Nueva</foreName> <surname>York</surname></persName></hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1359"/><q direct="unspecified">That is just what I want,</q> said I, <q direct="unspecified">we are <hi rend="italics">Confederados</hi>, and we have <hi rend="italics">la guerra</hi> with the <hi rend="italics">Americanos del Norte</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1360"/><q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Caramba</hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>said he, <q direct="unspecified">that is good; give her the steam quick, <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/><q direct="unspecified">No, no,</q> replied I, <q direct="unspecified">wait a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1363"/>I must pay due respect to your <rs type="role2">Queen</rs>, and the <rs type="role" reg="Captain-General">Captain-General</rs>; they command in these waters, within the league, and I must wait until the ships have passed beyond that.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>I accordingly waited until the ships had proceeded some <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from the coast, as estimated both by the pilot, and myself, when we turned the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>'s</hi> head seaward, and again removed the leash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>She was not long in pouncing upon the astonished prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>A booming gun, and the simultaneous descent of the <rs>Spanish</rs>, and ascent of the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>'s</hi> peak, when we had approached within about a mile of them, cleared up the mystery of the chase, and brought the fugitives to the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>In half an hour more, their papers had been examined, prize crews had been thrown on board of them, and they were <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> standing back in company with the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, to rejoin the other prizes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>I had now a fleet of <num value="6">six</num> sail, and when the sea breeze set in next morning, which it did between <time value="9">nine</time> and <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, I led into the harbor, the fleet following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>The <num value="3">three</num> newly captured vessels were the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">West Wind</rs>, of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>; the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Louisa Kilham</rs>, of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and the brigantine <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Naiad</rs></hi>, of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>They had all cargoes of sugar, which were covered by certificates of neutral property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>When the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> came abreast of the small fort, which has already been noticed, we were surprised to see the sentinels on post fire a couple of loaded muskets, the balls of which whistled over our heads, and to observe them making gestures, indicating that we must come to anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>This we immediately did; but the prizes, all of which had the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors flying, were permitted to pass, and they sped on their way to the town, some miles above, as they had been ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>When we had let go our anchor, I dispatched <persName n="Evans,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0133.0013.00138.00296" reg="mostcommon:Evans,William,E.,,:3"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName> to the fort, to call on the <name>Commandant</name>, and ask for an explanation of his conduct, in bringing us to. The explanation was simple enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>He did not know what to make of the new-born Confederate flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>He had never seen it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>It did not belong to any of the nations of the earth, of which he had any knowledge, and we might be a buccaneer for aught he knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>In the afternoon, the <name>Commandant</name> himself came on board to visit me, and inform me, on the part of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, with whom he had communicated, that I might proceed to the town, in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, if I desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>We drank a glass of wine together, and I satisfied him, that I had not come in to carry his fort by storm&mdash;which would have been an easy operation enough, as he had only about a corporal's guard under his command&mdash;or to sack the town of <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, after the fashion of the <name>Drakes</name>, and other <name>English</name> sea-robbers, who have left so vivid an impression upon Spanish memory, as to make Spanish commandants of small forts, cautious of all strange craft.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>It had only been a week since the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> had run the blockade of New Orleans, and already she was out of fuel!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>having only coal enough left for about <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> steaming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>Here was food for reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>I have sought a port of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, with these prizes, with the expectation that <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> will extend to the cruisers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the same friendly reception that, in similar circumstances, she would extend to the cruisers of the enemy; in other words, that she will permit me to leave the captured vessels within her jurisdiction, until they can be adjudicated by a <orgName n="Admiralty Court" type="court">Court of Admiralty of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>As a people maintaining a government <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi>, and not only holding the enemy in check, but gaining advantages over him, we are entitled to all the rights of belligerents, and I confidently rely upon the friendly disposition of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, who is our near neighbor, in the most important of her colonial possessions, to receive us with equal and evenhanded justice, if not with the sympathy which our identity of interests and policy, with regard to an important social and industrial institution, are so well calculated to inspire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>A rule which would <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> exclude our prizes from her ports, during the war, although it should be applied, in terms, equally to the enemy, would not, I respectfully suggest, be an equitable, or just rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>The basis of such a rule, as indeed, of all the conduct of a neutral during war, is equal and impartial justice to all the belligerents, without inclining to the side of either; and this should be a substantial and practical justice, and not exist in terms merely, which may be deceptive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Now, a little reflection will, I think, show your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> that the rule in question&mdash;the exclusion of the prizes of both belligerents from neutral ports&mdash;cannot be applied in the present war, without operating with great injustice to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1393"/>It is well known to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are a manufacturing and commercial people, whilst the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are an agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1394"/>The consequence of this dissimilarity of pursuits was, that at the breaking out of the war, the former had within their limits, and control, almost all the naval force of the old government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>This naval force they have dishonestly seized, and turned against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, regardless of the just claims of the latter to a large proportion of it, as tax-payers, out of whose contributions to the common Treasury it was created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by this disseizin of the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, are enabled, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> months of the war, to blockade all the ports of the latter States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>In this condition of things, observe the <hi rend="italics">practical</hi> working of the rule I am discussing, whatever may be the seeming fairness of its terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/>It will be admitted that we have equal belligerent rights with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important of these rights, in a war against a commercial people, is that which I have just exercised, of capturing his property, on the high seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>But how are the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to enjoy, to its full extent, the benefit of this right, if their cruisers are not permitted to enter neutral ports, with their prizes, and retain them there, in safe custody, until they can be condemned, and disposed of?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>They cannot send them into their own ports, for the reason already mentioned, viz.: that those ports are hermetically sealed by the agency of their own ships, forcibly wrested from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>If they cannot send them into neutral ports, where are they to send them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>Nowhere. Except for the purpose of destruction, therefore, their right of capturewould be entirely defeated by the adoption of the rule in question, whilst the opposite belligerent would not be inconvenienced by it, at all, as all his own ports are open to him. I take it for granted, that <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> will not think of acting upon so unjust, and unequal a rule.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>But another question arises, indeed has already arisen, in the cases of some of the very captures which I have brought into port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>The cargoes of several of the vessels are claimed, as appears by certificates found among the papers, as Spanish property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>This fact cannot, of course, be verified, except by a judicial proceeding, in the <rs type="place">Prize Courts</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/>But if the prizes cannot be sent either into the ports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, or <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> into neutral ports, how can this verification be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>Further&mdash; supposing there to be no dispute about the title to the cargo, how is it to be unladen, and delivered to the neutral claimant, unless the captured ship can make a port?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of the motives which influenced me in making a Spanish colonial port, was the fact that these cargoes were claimed by Spanish subjects, whom I was desirous of putting to as little inconvenience as possible, in the unlading and reception of their property, should it be restored to them, by a decree of the <rs type="place">Confederate Courts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>It will be for your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to consider, and act upon these grave questions, touching alike the interests of both our governments.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>I did not expect much to grow immediately out of the above communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>Indeed, as the reader will probably surmise, I had written it more for the eye of the <rs>Spanish Premier</rs>, than for that of the <rs>Governor</rs> of a small provincial town, who had no diplomatic power, and whom I knew to be timid, as are all the subordinate officers of absolute governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>I presumed that the <rs>Governor</rs> would telegraph it to the <name>CaptainGeneral</name>, at <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName>, and that the latter would hold the subject in abeyance, until he could hear from the <rs>Home Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1415"/>Nor was I disappointed in this expectation, for <persName n="Chapman,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0133.0013.00141.00301" reg="mostcommon:Chapman,Robert,T.,,:3"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Chapman</surname></persName> returned from <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, the next morning, and brought me intelligence to this effect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1416"/>To dispose of the questions raised, without the necessity of again returning to them, the reader is informed, that <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, in due time, followed the lead of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, in the matter of excluding prizes from her ports; and that my prizes were delivered&mdash;to whom, do you think, reader?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1417"/>You will naturally say, to myself, or my duly appointed agent, with instructions to take them out of the <rs>Spanish</rs> port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1418"/>This was the result to be logically expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1419"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Captain-General">Captain-General</rs> had received them, in trust, as it were, to abide the decision of his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1420"/>If that decision should be in favor of receiving the prizes of both belligerents, well; if not, I expected to be notified to take them away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1421"/>But nothing was further, it seems, from the intention of the <rs type="role" reg="Captain-General">Captain-General</rs>, than this simple and just proceeding; for as soon as the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation was received, he deliberately handed back all my prizes to their original owners!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1422"/>This was so barefaced a proceeding, that <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> it was necessary to allege some excuse for it, and the excuse given was, that I had violated the neutral waters of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, and captured my <num value="3">three</num> last prizes within the marine league&mdash;my sympathizing friend, the <rs>Spanish</rs> pilot, and an English sailor, on board the tug, being vouched as the respectable witnesses to the fact!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1423"/>Such was the power of Spanish gold, and <name>Yankee</name> unscrupulousness in the use of it. When I heard of these transactions a few months afterward, I planned a very pretty little quarrel between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, in case the former should be successful in establishing their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1424"/><placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, I thought, would make us a couple of very respectable States, with her staples of sugar and tobacco, and with her similar system of labor; and if <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> refused to foot our bill for the robbery of these vessels, we would foot it ourselves at her expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1425"/>But poor old <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1426"/>I ought perhaps to forgive thee, for thou wast afterward kicked, and cuffed by the very Power to which thou didst truckle&mdash;the <rs>Federal</rs> steamers of war making a free use of thy coast of the <q direct="unspecified">Ever <placeName reg="Faithful Island">Faithful Island</placeName> of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>,</q> chasing vessels on shore, and burning them, in contempt of thy jurisdiction, and in spite of thy remonstrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1429"/>Neighbors were called in, and the night was made merry, to a late hour, by the popping of champagne-corks and the story, and the song; and when the festivities had ceased, my tempest-tossed lieutentant was laid away in the sweetest and whitest of sheets, to dream of the eyes of the houries of the household, that had beamed upon him so kindly, that he was in danger of forgetting that he was a married man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1430"/>There was a hurrying to and fro, too, of the stewards, and mess boys, as the cutter in which he returned, came alongside of the ship, for there were sundry boxes, marked <placeName key="tgn,7008161" n="1.000 4" reg="bordeaux,gironde,aquitaine,france,europe">Bordeaux</placeName>, and Cette, and sundry baskets branded with anchors; and there were fruits, and flowers, and squalling chickens to be passed up.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>I had recourse to the chart, and having ascertained at what hour these steamers would be enabled to arrive, I fixed my own departure, a few hours ahead, so as to give them the satisfaction of finding that the bird, which they were in pursuit of, had flown.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>To avoid the coal dust, which is <num value="1">one</num> of the pests of a steamer, and the confusion, and noise which necessarily accompany the exceedingly poetic operation of coaling, I landed, as the sun was approaching the western horizon, in company with my junior lieutenant and sailing-master, for a stroll, and to obtain sights for testing my chronometers, as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Having disposed of the business part of the operation <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, in obedience to the old maxim; that is to say, having made our observations upon the sun, for time, we wandered about, for an hour, and more, amid the rich tropical vegetation of this queen of islands, now passing under the flowering acacia, and now under the deepfoliaged orange-tree, which charmed <num value="2">two</num> senses at once&mdash;that of smell, by the fragrance of its young flowers, and that of sight, by the golden hue of its luscious and tempting fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>We had landed abreast of our ship, and a few steps sufficed to put us in the midst of a dense wilderness, of floral beauty, with nothing to commune with but nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>What a contrast there was between this peaceful, and lovely scene, and the life we <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> had led for the last week!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>We almost loathed to go back to the dingy walls, and close quarters of our little craft, where everything told us of war, and admonished us that a life of toil, vexation, and danger lay before us, and that we must bid a long farewell to rural scenes, and rural pleasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>As we still wandered, absorbed in such speculations as these, unconscious of the flight of time, the sound of the evening gun came booming on the ear, to recall us to our senses, and retracing our steps, we hurriedly re-embarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1465"/>The sea was nearly calm, and the usual land breeze was gently breathing, rather than blowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1466"/>Having given the course to the officer of the deck, I was glad to go below, and turn in, after the excitement, and confusion of the last <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1467"/>We steamed on, all the next day, without any incident to break in upon the monotony, except a short chase which we gave to a brigantine, which proved, upon our coming up with her, to be Spanish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1468"/>Between <time value="9">nine</time>, and <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> in the evening, we passed the small islands of the <hi rend="italics">Caymans</hi>, which we found to be laid down in the charts we were using, some <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure> too far to the westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1469"/>As there is a current setting in the vicinity of these islands, and as the islands themselves are so low, as to be seen with difficulty, in a dark night,&mdash;and the night on which we were passing them was dark,&mdash;I make this observation, to put navigators on their guard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1470"/>The morning of the <dateStruct value="-07-9"><day reg="9">ninth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> dawned clear, and beautifully, but as the sun gained power, the trade-wind increased, until it blew half a gale, raising considerable sea, and impeding the progress of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1471"/>Indeed, so little speed did we make, that the island of <placeName reg="Jamaica, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005556">Jamaica</placeName>, which we had descried with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> streaks of dawn, remained in sight all day; its blue mountains softened but not obliterated by the distance as the evening set in. The sea was as blue as the mountains, and the waves seemed almost as large, to our eyes, as the little steamer plunged into, and struggled with them, in her vain attempt <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> to make headway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>All the force of her engine was incapable of driving her at a greater speed than <num value="5">five</num> knots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>The next day, and the day after were equally unpropitious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>Indeed the weather went from bad, to worse, for now the sky became densely overcast, with black, and angry-looking clouds, and the wind began to whistle through the rigging, with all the symptoms of a gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>We were approaching the hurricane season, and there was no telling at what moment, <num value="1">one</num> of those terrible cyclones of the <placeName reg="Caribbean Sea" key="tgn,7004569">Caribbean Sea</placeName> might sweep over us. To add to the gloominess of the prospect, we were comparatively out of the track of commerce, and had seen no sail, since we had overhauled the <name n="Espana">Spanish</name> brigantine.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>As explained to the reader, in <num value="1">one</num> of the opening chapters, it was my intention to proceed from <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>, there recoal, and thence make the best of my way to <placeName reg="Cape St. Roque">Cape St. Roque</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,2031163;tgn,1000047" n="0.014 000000.8832	placename;tgn,2031163;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.6156	placename;tgn,1000047;brasil,South America" reg="brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;brasil,South America">Brazil</placeName>, where I expected to reap a rich harvest from the enemy's commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>I was now obliged to abandon, or at least to modify this design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>It would not be possible for me to reach <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>, with my present supply of coal, in the teeth of such trade-winds, as I had been encountering for the last few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>I therefore determined to bend down toward the <rs>Spanish Main</rs>; converting the present head-wind, into a fair wind, for at least a part of the way, and hoping to find the weather more propitious, on that coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>It was now the <dateStruct value="-07-13"><day reg="13">thirteenth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and as we had sailed from <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="2">seventh</day></dateStruct>, we had consumed <num value="6">six</num> out of our <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> supply of fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>Steaming was no longer to be thought of, and we must make some port under sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>The <rs type="place">Dutch island</rs> of Curacoa lay under our lee, and we accordingly made sail for that island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1483"/>The engineer was ordered to let his fires go down, and uncouple his propeller that it might not retard the speed of the ship, and the sailors were sent aloft to loose the topsails.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1484"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time that we were to make use of our sails, unaided by steam, and the old sailors of the ship, who had not bestridden a yard for some months, leaped aloft, with a will, to obey the welcome order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1485"/>The race of sailors has not yet entirely died out, though the steamship is fast making sad havoc with it. There is the same difference between the old-time sailor, who <pb id="p.149" n="149"/> has been bred in the sailing-ship, and the modern sailor of the steamship, that there is between the well-trained fox-hound, who chases Reynard all day, and the cur that dodges a rabbit about, for half an hour or so. The sailing-ship has a romance, and a poetry about her, which is thoroughly killed by steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>The sailor of the former loves, for its own sake, the howling of the gale, and there is no music so sweet to his ear, as the shouting of orders through the trumpet of the officer of the deck, when he is poised upon the topsail-yard, of the rolling and tumbling ship, hauling out the <q direct="unspecified">weather ear-ring.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1487"/>It is the <hi rend="italics">ranz de vache</hi>, which recalls the memory of his boyhood, and youth, when under the tutelage of some foster-father of an old salt, he was taking his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons in seamanship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1488"/>It used to be beautiful to witness the rivalry of these children of the deep, when the pitiless hurricane was scourging their beloved ship, and threatening her with destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1489"/>The greater the danger, the more eager the contest for the post of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>Was there a sail to be secured, which appeared about to be torn into ribbons, by the gale, and the loose gear of which threatened to whip the sailor from the yard; or was there a topmast to be climbed, which was bending like a willow wand under the fury of the blast, threatening to part at every moment, and throw the climber into the raging, and seething caldron of waters beneath, from which it would be impossible to rescue him, <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0014.00149.00312" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>, noble <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0014.00149.00313" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> was ever ready for the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>I have seen an old naval captain, who had been some years retired from the sea, almost melt into tears, as he listened to the musical <q direct="unspecified">heaving of the lead</q> by an old sailor, in the <q direct="unspecified">chains</q> of a passing ship of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>But steam, practical, commonplace, hard-working steam, has well-nigh changed all this, and cut away the webbing from the foot of the old-time sailor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1493"/>Seamanship, evolutions, invention, skill, and ready resource in times of difficulty, and danger, have nearly all gone out of fashion, and instead of reefing the topsails, and club-hauling, and box-hauling the ship, some order is now sent to the engineer, about regulating his fires, and paying attention to his <rs n="steam gauges" type="product">steam-gauges</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>Alas! alas! there will be no more Nelsons, and Collingwoods, and no more such venerable <q direct="unspecified">bulwarks upon the deep,</q> as the <hi rend="italics">Victory</hi>, and the <pb id="p.150" n="150"/> <hi rend="italics">Royal Sovereign</hi>. In future wars upon the ocean, all combatants will be on the dead level of impenetrable iron walls, with regard to dash, and courage, and with regard to seamanship, and evolutions, all the knowledge that will be required of them, will be to know how to steer a nondescript box toward their enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>Our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> night under canvas, I find thus described, in my journal: <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Heavy sea">Heavy sea</placeName> all night, and ship rolling, and tumbling about, though doing pretty well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>The propeller revolves freely, and we are making about <num value="5">five</num> knots.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>The next day was <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and the weather was somewhat ameliorated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>The wind continued nearly as fresh as before, but as we were now running a point free, this was no objection, and the black, angry clouds had disappeared, leaving a bright, and cheerful sky. A sail was seen on the distant horizon, but it was too rough to chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>This was our usual muster-day, but the decks were wet, and uncomfortable, and I permitted my crew to rest, they having scarcely yet recovered from the fatigue of the last few days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/>There is, perhaps, no part of the world where the weather is so uniformly fine, as on the <rs>Spanish Main</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>The cyclones never bend in that direction, and even the ordinary gales are unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>We were already beginning to feel the influence of this meteorological change; for on <date>Monday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-07-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, the weather was thus described in my journal: <q direct="unspecified">Weather moderating, and the sea going down, though still rough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1503"/>Nothing seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1504"/>In the afternoon, pleasant, with a moderate breeze, and the clouds assuming their usual soft, fleecy, tradewind appearance.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>The next day was still clear, though the wind had freshened, and the ship was making good speed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1506"/>At <time value="9am">nine A. M.</time> we made the land, on the starboard bow, which proved to be the island of Oruba, to leeward, a few miles, of Curacoa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1507"/>For some hours past, we had been within the influence of the equatorial current, which sets westward, along this coast, with considerable velocity, and it had carried us a little out of our course, though we had made some allowance for it. We hauled up, a point, or <num value="2">two</num>, and at <time value="11am">eleven A. M.</time> we made the island of Curacoa, on the port bow. We doubled the northwest end of the island, at about <time value="4pm">four P. M.</time> and hauling up on the <pb id="p.151" n="151"/> south side of it we soon brought the wind ahead, when it became necessary to put the ship under steam again, and to furl the sails.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1508"/>The afternoon proved beautifully bright, and clear; the sea was of a deep indigo-blue, and we were all charmed, even with this barren little island, as we steamed along its bold, and blackened shores, of limestone rock, alongside of which the heaviest ship might have run, and throwing out her bow and stern lines, made herself fast with impunity, so perpendicularly deep were the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>Our average distance from the land, as we steamed along, was not greater than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>There were a few stunted trees, only, to be seen, in the little ravines, and some wild shrubbery, and sickly looking grass, struggling for existence on the hills' sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>A few goats were browsing about here, and there, and the only evidence of commerce, or thrift, that we saw, were some piles of salt, that had been raked up from the lagoons, ready for shipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>And yet the <rs>Dutch</rs> live, and thrive here, and have built up quite a pretty little town&mdash;that of St. Anne's, to which we were bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>The explanation of which is, that the island lies contiguous to the <rs type="place">Venezuelan coast</rs>, and is a free port, for the introduction of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName>, and American goods, in which a considerable trade is carried on, with the main land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1514"/>We arrived off the town, with its imposing battlements frowning on either side of the harbor, about dusk, and immediately hoisted a jack, and fired a gun, for a pilot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1515"/>In the course of half an hour, or so, this indispensable individual appeared, but it was too late, he said, for us to attempt the entrance, that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1516"/>He would come off, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing in the morning, and take us in. With this assurance we rested satisfied, and lay off, and on, during the night, under easy steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1517"/>But we were not to gain entrance to this quaint little <placeName reg="Dutch Town, Brooke, West Virginia" key="tgn,2302373">Dutch town</placeName>, so easily, as had been supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1518"/>We were to have here a foretaste of the trouble, that the <rs>Federal Consuls</rs> were to give us in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1519"/>We have already commented on the love of <orgName>office of the American</orgName> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1520"/>There is no hole, or corner of the earth, into which a ship can enter, and where there is a dollar to be made, that has not its American Consul, small or large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1521"/>The smallest of salaries are eagerly accepted, and, as a <pb id="p.152" n="152"/> consequence, the smallest of men are sometimes sent to fill these places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1522"/>But the smaller the place, the bigger were the cocked hats and epaulettes the officials wore, and the more brim-full were they of patriotism.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1657"/>In making this request, I do not propose that the <name>Venezuelan</name> government shall depart from a strict neutrality between the belligerents, as the same rule it applies to us, it can give the other party the benefit of, also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1658"/>In other words, with the most scrupulous regard for her neutrality, she may permit both belligerents to bring their prizes into her waters; and, of this, neither belligerent could complain, since whatever justice is extended to its enemy, is extended also to itself. * * * [Here follows a repetition of the facts with regard to the seizure of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, and the establishment of the blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, already stated in my letter to the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1016331" n="1.000 5" reg="cienfuegos,cienfuegos,cuba,north and central america">Cienfuegos</placeName>.] * * * Thus, your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> sees, that under the rule of exclusion, the enemy could enjoy his right of capture, to its full extent&mdash;all his own ports being open to him&mdash;whilst the cruisers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> could enjoy it, <hi rend="italics">sub modo</hi>, only; that is, for the purpose of destroying their prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>A rule which would produce such unequal results as this, is not a just rule (although it might, in terms, be extended to both parties), and as equality and justice, are of the essence of neutrality, I take it for granted, that <placeName key="tgn,1000059" n="1.000 13" reg="venezuela">Venezuela</placeName> will not adopt it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>On the other hand, the rule admitting both parties, alike, with their prizes into your ports, until the prize courts of the respective countries could have time to adjudicate the cases, would work equal and exact justice to both; and this is all that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> demand.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>We were steaming at a distance of <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> from the land, and, as the shades of evening closed in, we descried a Federal brigantine, running down the coast&mdash;probably for the port we had just left-hugging the bold shore very affectionately, to keep within the charmed marine league, within which she knew she was safe from capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>We did not, of course, molest her, as I made it a point always to respect the jurisdiction of neutrals, though never so weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>As we were running along the land, sufficiently near for its influence to be felt upon the trade-winds, it became nearly calm during the night, the land and sea breezes, each struggling for the mastery, and thus neutralizing each other's forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>The <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> steamer sprang forward with renewed speed, and when the day dawned the next morning, we were far to windward of Laguayra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>The sun rose in a sky, without a cloud, and the wind did not freshen, as the day advanced, so much as it had done the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>The mountains of <placeName key="tgn,1000059" n="1.000 13" reg="venezuela">Venezuela</placeName> lay sleeping in the distance, robed in a mantle of heavenly blue, numerous sea-birds were on the wing, and the sail of a fishing-boat, here and there, added picturesqueness to the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/>At <time value="9:30">half-past 9</time>, we gave chase to a fore-and-aft schooner, which proved to be a Venezuela coaster.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/>In the afternoon, we passed sufficiently near the island of Tortuga, to run over some of its coral banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/>The sun was declining behind the yet visible mountains, and the sea breeze had died away to nearly a calm, leaving the bright, and sparkling waters, with a mirrored surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/>We now entered upon a scene of transcendent beauty, but the beauty was that of the deep, and not of the surface landscape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>The reader is familiar with the history of the coral insect, that patient little stone-mason of the deep, which, though scarcely visible through the microscope, lays the foundations of islands, and of continents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>The little coralline sometimes commences its work, hundreds of fathoms down in the deep sea, and working patiently, and laboriously, day and night, night and day, week after week, month after month, year after year, and century after century, finally brings its structure to the surface.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>When its tiny blocks of lime-stone, which it has secreted from the salts of the sea, have been piled so high, that the tides now cover the structure, and now leave it dry, the little toiler of the sea, having performed the functions prescribed to it by its Creator, dies, and is entombed in a mausoleum more proud than any that could be reared by human hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>The winds, and the clouds now take charge of the new island, or continent, and begin to prepare it for vegetation, and the habitation of man, and animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>The <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>, within the tropics is, <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>, the coral sea, and the navigator of that ocean is familiar with the phenomenon, which I am about to describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>In the midst of a clear sky, the mariner sometimes discovers on the verge of the horizon, a light, fleecy cloud, and as he sails toward it, he is surprised to find that it scarcely alters its <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>It rises a little, and a little higher, as he approaches it, pretty much as the land would appear to rise, if he were sailing toward it, but that is all. He sails on, and on, and when he has come near the cloud, he is surprised to see under it, a white line of foam, or, maybe a breaker, if there is any undulation in the sea, in a spot where all is represented as deep water on his chart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>Examining with his telescope, he now discovers, in the intervals of the foam, caused by the rising and falling of the long, lazy swell, a coral bank, so white as scarcely to be distinguished from the seething and boiling foam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>He has discovered the germ of a new island, which in the course of time, and the decrees of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, will be covered with forests, and inhabited by men, and animals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>The cloud, as a sort of <q direct="unspecified">pillar by day,</q> has conducted him to the spot, whilst it has, at the same time, warned him of his danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>But the cloud&mdash;how came it there, why does it remain so faithfully at its post, and what are its functions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most beautiful of the phenomena of tropical countries is the alternation, with the regularity of clock-work, of the land and sea breezes; by day, the sea breeze blowing toward the land, and by night the land breeze blowing toward the sea. The reason of this is as follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>The land absorbs heat, and radiates it, more rapidly than the sea. The consequence is, that when the sun has risen, an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, the land becomes warmer than the surrounding sea, and there is an in-draught toward it; in other words, the sea breeze begins to blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>When, on the contrary, the sun has set, and withdrawn his rays from both land and sea, and radiation begins, the land, parting with its absorbed heat, more rapidly than the sea, soon becomes cooler than the sea. As a consequence, there is an out-draught from the land; in other words, the land breeze has commenced to blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>The reader now sees how it is, that the <q direct="unspecified">pillar by day</q> hangs over the little coral island; the bank of coral absorbing heat by day more rapidly than the surrounding sea, there is an in-draught setting toward it, and as the lazy trade-winds approach it, they themselves become heated, and ascend into the upper air. There is thus a constantly ascending column of heated atmosphere over these <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>This ascending column of atmosphere, when it reaches a certain point, is condensed into cumuli of beautiful, fleecy clouds, often piled up in the most fantastic and gorgeous shapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>It is thus that the cloud becomes stationary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>It is ever forming, and ever passing off; retaining, it may be, its original form, but its nebulae constantly changing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>When a cooler blast of trade-wind than usual comes along, the condensation is more rapid, and perfect, and showers of rain fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>The sea-birds are already hovering, in clouds, over the inchoate little island, fishing, and wading in its shallow waters, and roosting on it, when they can get a sufficient foothold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>Vegetation soon ensues, and, in the course of a few more ages, nature completes her work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>But to return from this digression, into which we were led by a view of the coral bank over which we were passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>The little insect, which is at work under our feet, has not yet brought its structure sufficiently near the surface, to obstruct our passage over it. We are in <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> fathoms of water, but this water is so clear, that we are enabled to see the most minute object, quite distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>We have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/><q direct="unspecified">slowed</q> the engine the better to enjoy the beautiful sub-marine landscape; and look!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>we are passing over a miniature forest, instinct with life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>There are beautifully branching trees of madrepores, whose prongs are from <num value="1">one</num> to <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> in length, and sometimes curiously interlaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>Each <num value="1">one</num> of the branches, as well as the trunk, has a number of little notches in it. These are the cells in which the little stone-mason is at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Adhering to the branches of these miniature trees, like mosses, and lichens, you see sundry formations that you might mistake for leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>These are also cellular, and are the workshops of the little masons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>Scattered around, among the trees, are waving the most gorgeous of fans, and, what we might call sea-ferns, and palms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>These are of a variety of brilliant colors, purple predominating.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>Lying on the smooth, white sand, are boulders of coral in a variety of shapes&mdash;some, like the domes of miniature cathedrals; some, perfectly spherical; some, cylindrical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>These, and the trees, are mostly of a creamy white, though occasionally, pink, violet, and green are discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>As the passage <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> of the steamer gives motion to the otherwise smooth sea, the fans, ferns, and palms wave, gracefully, changing their tints as the light flashes upon them, through the pellucid waters The beholder looks entranced, as though he were gazing upon a fairy scene, by moonlight; and to add to the illusion, there is a movement of life, all new to the eye, in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>The beautiful star-fish, with its <num value="5">five</num> points, as equally, and regularly arranged, as though it had been done by the rule of the mathematician, with great worm-like molluscs, lie torpid on the white sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>Jelly-fish, polypi, and other nondescript shapes, float about in the miniature forest; and darting hither and thither, among the many-tinted ferns, some apparently in sport, and some in pursuit of their prey, are hundreds of little fishes, sparkling, and gleaming in <rs type="color">silver</rs>, and <rs type="color">gold</rs>, and <rs type="color">green</rs>, and scarlet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>The most curious of these is the parrot-fish, whose head is shaped like the beak of the parrot, and whose color is light green.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>How wonderfully full is the sea of animal life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>All this picture is animal life; for what appears to be the vegetable portion of this sub-marine landscape, is scarcely vegetable at all. The waving ferns, fans, and palms are all instinct with animal life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>The patient little toiler of the sea, the coralline insect, is busy with them, as he is with his limestone trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>He is helping on their formation by his secretions, and it is difficult to say what portion of them is vegetable, what, mineral, and what, animal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>I had been an hour, and more, entranced by the fairy submarine forest, and its denizens, which I have so imperfectly described, when the sun sank behind the <name>Andes</name>, and night threw her mantle upon the waters, changing all the sparkling colors of forest, and fish, to sombre gray, and admonishing me, that it was time to return to every-day life, and the duties of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/><q direct="unspecified">Let her have the steam,</q> said I to the officer of the deck as I arose from my bent posture over the ship's rail; and, in a moment more, the propeller was thundering us along at our usual speed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>At <time value="11pm">eleven P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>The next day, the weather still continued clear and pleasant, the trade-wind being sufficiently light not to impede our headway, for we were steaming, as the reader will recollect, nearly head to wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/>We had experienced but little adverse current during the last <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, and were making very satisfactory progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>I was now making a passage, rather than cruising, as a sail is a rare sight, in the part of the ocean I was traversing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>At meridian we passed that singular group of islands called the <hi rend="italics">Frayles&mdash;Anglice</hi>, friars&mdash;jutting up from the sea in cones of different shapes, and looking, at a distance, not unlike so many hooded monks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>With the exception of a transient fisherman, who now and then hauls up his boat out of the reach of the surf, on these harborless islands, and pitches his tent, made of his boat's sail, for a few days of rest and refreshment, they have no inhabitants.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>So said my journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>Indeed the day in question was a memorable <num value="1">one</num>, from its scenery, and surroundings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>Few landscapes present so bold, and imposing a picture as this part of the <name>South American</name> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>The <rs>Andes</rs> here rise abruptly out of the sea, to a great height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Our little craft running along their base, in the bluest and deepest of water, looked like a mere cockle-shell, or nautilus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>Besides the torrents of rain, that were coming down upon our decks, and through which, at times, we could barely catch a glimpse of the majestic, and sombre-looking mountains, we were blinded by the most vivid flashes of lightning, simultaneously with which, the rolling and crashing of the thunder deafened our ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>I had stood on the banks of the <rs type="place">Lake of Geneva</rs>, and witnessed a storm in the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName>, during which <persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n0133.0016.00175.00369" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName>'s celebrated lines occurred to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>That word <q direct="unspecified">joyous</q> was well chosen by the poet, for the mountains did indeed seem to rejoice in this grand display of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>Of wind there was scarcely any&mdash;what little there was, was frequently off the land, and even blew in the direction opposite to that of the trade-wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>We were in the rainy season, along this coast, and all the vegetable kingdom was in full luxuriance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>The cocoanut, and other palms, giving an Eastern aspect to the scenery, waved the greenest of feathery branches, and every shrub, and almost every tree rejoiced in its flower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>It was delightful to inhale the fragrance, as the whirling aerial current brought us an occasional puff from the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>On board the ship, we looked like so many half-drowned rats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>The officer of the deck, trumpet in hand, was ensconced, to his ears, in his india-rubber pea jacket, his long beard looking like a wet mop, and little rills of rain trickling down his neck, and shoulders, from his slouched <q direct="unspecified">Sou'wester.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>The midshipman of the watch had taken off his shoes, and rolled up his trousers, and was paddling about in the pools on deck, as well pleased as a young duck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>And as for the old salt, he was in his element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>There was plenty of fresh water to wash his clothes in, and accordingly the decks were filled with industrious washers, or rather scrubbers, each with his scrubbing-brush, and bit of soap, and a little pile of soiled duck frocks and trousers by his side.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The reader has been informed, that we were running along the coast, within a mile of it, to enable us to keep sight of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2079"/>If the strange vessel were a mail-steamer, she would, of course, be familiar with the waters in which she plied, and, instead of anchoring outside, would have run boldly into the river without waiting for daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2080"/>Besides, she had no lights about her, as she approached, and packet steamers always go well lighted up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2102"/>Cattle wandered over the pasture lands, the negroes were well clothed, and <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> there was a general air of abundance, and contentment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2300"/>We swept the sea horizon, with our glasses, as we approached the bar, but the enemy's cruisers were nowhere to be seen, and at <time value="3pm">three P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2301"/>The question now was, in what direction should we steer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2302"/>I was within striking distance of the cruising ground, for which I had set out&mdash;<placeName reg="Cape St. Roque">Cape St. Roque</placeName>; but we had been so long delayed, that we should reach it, if we proceeded thither at all, at a most unpropitious season&mdash;the sailing, and steaming qualities of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2303"/>The trade-winds were sweeping round the <name>Cape</name>, blowing half a gale, on the wings of which the dullest ship would be able to run away from us, if we trusted to sail, alone; and steam, in the present state of my exchequer, was out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>I had paid <measure n="17.50dollars" type="currency">$17.50</measure> per ton for the coal I had taken in, at <placeName reg="Maranham">Maranham</placeName>, and but for the timely loan of <persName n="Wetson,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0018.00216.00456" reg="nearbymention:Wetson,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wetson</surname></persName>, should have exhausted my treasury entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>The trade-winds would continue to blow, with equal force, until some time in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>; they would then moderate, and from that time, onward, until <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, we might expect more gentle weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>This, then, was the only <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> season, in which the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> could operate off the <name>Cape</name>, to advantage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>On the other hand, the calm belt of the equator lay before me-its southern edge, at this season of the year, being in latitude of about <num value="5">5</num>&deg; N. All the homeward-bound trade of the enemy passed through this calm belt, or used to pass through it before the war, at a well-known crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>At that crossing, there would be a calm sea, light, and variable winds, and rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2309"/>In such weather, I could lie in wait for my prey, under sail, and, if surprise, and stratagem did not effect my purpose, I could, when a sail appeared, get up steam and chase and capture, without the expenditure of much fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2310"/>In this way, with the coal I had on board, I could prolong my cruise, probably, for a couple of months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2311"/>I did not hesitate long, therefore, between the <num value="2">two</num> schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2312"/>I turned my ship's head to the northward, and eastward, for the calm belt, and before sunset, we had run the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName> out of sight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2313"/>We recrossed the equator, the next day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2314"/>We could nearly do this, as it was, and so rapidly did he dip, at <time value="12pm">noon</time>, that we were obliged to watch him, with constant vigilance, to ascertain the precise moment of <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2315"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-09-17"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="17">17</day></dateStruct></hi>th.&mdash;The sea is of a deep, indigo blue, and we have a bright, and exceedingly transparent atmosphere, with a fresh breeze from the south-east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2316"/>At <time value="11:30">half-past 11</time> A. M., we let the steam go down, uncoupled the propeller, and put the ship under sail.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2318"/>For the next few days, we encountered a remarkable easterly current&mdash;the current, in this part of the ocean, being almost constantly to the westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2319"/>This current&mdash;which we were now stemming, for we were sailing toward the north-west&mdash;retarded us, as much as <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>, in a single day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2320"/>So remarkable did the phenomenon appear, that if I had noticed it, for but a single day, I should have been inclined to think that I had made some mistake in my observations, or that there was some <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> error in my instrument, but we noticed it, day after day, for <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2321"/>Contemporaneously with this phenomenon, another, and even more wonderful <num value="1">one</num> appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2322"/>This was a succession of tide-rips, so remarkable, that they deserve special description.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2323"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> lay nearly stationary, during the whole of these phenomena&mdash;the easterly current setting her back, nearly as much as she gained under sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>She was in the average latitude of <num value="5">5</num>&deg; N., and average longitude of <num value="42">42</num>&deg; W. For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, the rips appeared with wonderful regularity&mdash;there being an interval of just <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>They approached us from the south, and travelled toward the north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, only a line of foam would be seen, on the distant horizon, approaching the ship very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>As it came nearer, an almost perpendicular wall of water, extending <name>east</name> and <name>west</name>, as far as the eye could reach, would be seen, the top of the wall boiling and foaming, like a breaker rolling over a rocky bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>As the ridge approached nearer and nearer, it assumed the form of a series of rough billows, jostling against, and struggling with each other, producing a scene of the utmost confusion, the noise resembling that of a distant cataract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>Reaching the ship, these billows would strike her with such force, as to send their spray to the deck, and cause her to roll and pitch, as though she were amid breakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>The phenomenon was, indeed, that of breakers, only the cause was not apparent&mdash;there being no shoal water to account for it. The <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> sometimes rolled so violently in these breakers, when broadside to, that we were obliged to keep her off her course, several points, to bring the sea on her quarter, and thus mitigate the effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>The belt of rips would not be broad, and as it travelled very rapidly&mdash;<num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> the hour&mdash;the ship would not be long within its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>In the course of <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour, it would disappear, entirely, on the distant northern horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>So curious was the whole phenomenon, that the sailors, as well as the officers, assembled, as if by common consent, to witness it. <q direct="unspecified">There come the tide rips!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>some would exclaim, and, in a moment there would be a demand for the telescopes, and a rush to the ship's side, to witness the curious spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>These rips have frequently been <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> noticed by navigators, and discussed by philosophers, but, hitherto, no satisfactory explanation has been given of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/>They are like the bores, at the mouths of great rivers; as at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1121168" n="1.000 10" reg="Amazonas,South America">Amazon</placeName>, in the western hemisphere, and of the <rs>Ganges</rs>, in the eastern; great breathings, or convulsions of the sea, the causes of which elude our research.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2337"/>These bores sometimes come in, in great perpendicular walls, sweeping everything before them, and causing immense destruction of life, and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2338"/>I was, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, inclined to attribute these tide rips to the lunar influence, as they appeared twice in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, like the tides, and each time near the passing of the meridian, by the moon; but, in a few days, they varied their times of appearance, and came on quite irregularly, sometimes with an interval of <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>, only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2339"/>And then the tidal wave, for it is evidently this, and not a current, should be from east to west, if it were due to lunar influence; and we have seen that it travelled from south to north.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>Nor could I connect it with the easterly current that was prevailing &mdash;for it travelled at right angles to the current, and not with, or against it. It was, evidently, due to some pretty uniform law, as it always travelled in the same direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>We reached the calm belt, on the <dateStruct value="-09-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, for, on this day, having lost the south-east trade, we had light and baffling winds from the south-west, and rain-clouds began to muster overhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/>On the next day, the weather being in its normal condition of cloud, the welcome cry of <q direct="unspecified">sail ho!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2343"/>came resounding from the mast-head, with a more prolonged, and musical cadence than usual&mdash;the look-out, with the rest of the crew, having become tired of the inactivity of the last few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2344"/>All was bustle, immediately, about the decks; and in half an hour, with the sails snugly furled, and the ship under steam, we were in hot pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2345"/>The stranger was a brigantine, and was standing to the north-west, pursuing the usual crossing of the calm belt, as best he might, in the light winds, that were blowing, sometimes this way, sometimes that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2346"/>We came up with him quite rapidly, there being scarcely a ripple on the surface of the smooth sea, to impede our progress, and when we had come sufficiently near to enable him to make it out, distinctly, we showed him the enemy's flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2347"/>He was evidently <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> prepared with his own flag, for, in less than a minute, the lazy breeze was toying and playing with it, and presently blew it out sufficiently, to enable us to make out the well-known and welcome stars and stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2348"/>We hove him to, by <q direct="unspecified">hail,</q> and hauling down the false colors, and hoisting our own, we sent a boat on board of him, and captured him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2349"/>We transferred the crew of the captured vessel to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, replacing it with a prize crew, and got on board from her such articles of provisions, cordage, and sails as we required; but instead of burning her, we transformed her, for the present, into a scout vessel, to assist us in discovering other prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2351"/>The following was his commission:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2353"/>During the day, you will keep from <num value="7">seven</num> to <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure>, to the westward, and to windward, and keep a bright look-out, from your top-gallant yard, for sails&mdash;signalling to us, such as you may descry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2358"/>Long before night, the excitement of the chase and capture had died away, and things had resumed their wonted course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2359"/>The <num value="2">two</num> ships hovered about the <q direct="unspecified">crossing,</q> for several days, keeping a bright look-out, but nothing more appeared; and on the <dateStruct value="-09-29"><day reg="29">29th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0133.0018.00220.00462" reg="nearbymention:Parke,Joseph,,,"><surname>Parke</surname></persName></hi> having been called alongside, by signal, her prize crew <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> was taken out, and the ship burned, after having been made a target, for a few hours, for the practice of the crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2360"/>It was evidently no longer of any use to bother ourselves about the crossing of the calm-belt, for, instead of falling in with a constant stream of the enemy's ships, returning home, from differferent parts of the world, we had been cruising in it, some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, and had sighted but a single sail!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2361"/>We had kept ourselves between the parallels of <num value="2">2</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime; N., and <num value="9">9</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime; N., and between the meridians of <num value="41">41</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime; W., and <num value="47">47</num>&deg; <num value="30">30</num>&prime; W.; and if the reader have any curiosity on the subject, by referring to the map, he will perceive, that the north-western diagonal of the quadrilateral figure, formed by these parallels, and meridians, is the direct course between <placeName reg="Cape St. Roque">Cape St. Roque</placeName>, and New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2362"/>But the wary sea-birds had, evidently, all taken the alarm, and winged their way, home, by other routes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2363"/>I was the more convinced of this, by an intercepted letter which I captured in the letter-bag of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Parke,,,,," id="n0133.0018.00221.00463" reg="nearbymention:Parke,Joseph,,,"><surname>Parke</surname></persName></hi>, which was written by the master of the <term type="ship">ship</term>, <rs type="ship">Asteroid</rs>, to his owner, and which ran as follows:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>We still kept along on the beaten track of homeward-bound ships, but with little expectation of making any prizes, and for some days overhauled none but neutral ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2370"/>Many of these had cargoes for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but not having the same motive to avoid me, that the enemy's ships had, they were content to travel the usual highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2371"/>Although many of them had enemy's property, on board, <pb id="p.222" n="222"/> they were perfectly safe from molestation &mdash; the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>' Government having adopted, as the reader has seen, in its Act declaring, that, by the conduct of the enemy, a state of war existed, the liberal principle, that <q direct="unspecified">Free ships make free goods.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2380"/>Coming up a little nearer, we now fired a shotted gun at him, taking care not to strike him, but throwing the shot so near as to give him the benefit of its rather ominous music, as it whistled past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>Sir:&mdash;I have had the honor to receive your letter of yesterday, in which you communicate to me the views of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7005870" n="1.000 1" reg="martinique,north and central america">Martinique</placeName>, relative to the protection of my right of asylum, in the waters of this island; and I regret to say, that those views do not appear to me to come up to the requirements of the international code.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>The Governor says, that <q direct="unspecified">it does not enter into his intentions, to exercise toward the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Iroquois, Wyoming, West Virginia" key="tgn,2414564">Iroquois</placeName></hi>, either by night, or by day, so active a <hi rend="italics">surveillance</hi> as you [I] desire</q>; and you tell me, that I ought to have <q direct="unspecified">confidence in the strict execution of a promise, made by a commander in the military marine of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, so long as he has not shown to me the evidence that this engagement has not been scrupulously fulfilled.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>It would appear from these expressions, that the only protection I am to receive against the blockade of the enemy, is a simple promise exacted by you, from that enemy, that he will keep himself without the marine league, the <rs>Governor</rs>, in the meantime, exercising no watch, by night or by day, to see whether this promise is complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>In addition to the violations of neutrality reported by me, yesterday, I have, this morning, to report, that <num value="1">one</num> of my officers being on shore, in the northern environs of the town, last night, between <time value="8">eight</time> and <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, saw <num value="2">two</num> boats, each pulling <num value="8">eight</num> oars, the men dressed in dark blue clothing, with the caps usually worn by the sailors of the <rs>Federal Navy</rs>, pulling quietly in toward the beach; and that he distinctly heard a conversation, in <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0133.0020.00256.00592" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, between them&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of them saying to the other, <q direct="unspecified">Look <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>there she is, I see her,</q>&mdash; in allusion, doubtless, to this ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>These boats are neither more nor less than scout, or sentinel boats, sent to watch the movements, within neutral waters, of their enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>Now, with all due deference to his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, I cannot see the difference between the violation <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> of the neutrality of these waters, by the enemy's boats, and by his ship; and if no surveillance is to be exercised, either by night or by day, I am receiving very much such protection as the wolf would accord to the lamb.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>It is an act of war for the enemy to approach me, with his boats, for the purpose of reconnoissance, or watch, and especially during the night, and I have the same right to demand that he keep his boats beyond the marine league, as that he keep his ship, at that distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Nor am I willing to rely upon his promise, that he will not infringe my rights, in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>If <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 10" reg="france">France</placeName> owes me protection, it is her duty to accord it to me, herself, and not remit me to the good faith, or bad faith, of my enemy; in other words, I respectfully suggest, that it is her <hi rend="italics">duty</hi>, to exercise <hi rend="italics">surveillance</hi> over her own waters, both <q direct="unspecified">by night, and by day,</q> when <num value="1">one</num> belligerent is blockading another, in those waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>I have, therefore, respectfully to request, that you will keep a watch, by means of guard boats, at both points of the harbor, to prevent a repetition of the hostile act, which was committed against me last night; or if you will not do this, that you will permit me to arm boats, and capture the enemy, when so approaching me. It would seem quite plain, either that I should be protected, or be permitted to protect myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>I was obliged to degrade him, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> of the run; and, from that time, onward, he never heard the last of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Iroquois, Wyoming, West Virginia" key="tgn,2414564">Iroquois</placeName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half hour's run was a very anxious <num value="1">one</num> for us, as the reader may suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>It was a marvel, indeed, that she had not seen us. Our chimney was vomiting forth dense volumes of black smoke, that ought to have betrayed us, even if our hull had been invisible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>I was quite relieved, therefore, as I saw the lights of the town fading, gradually, in the distance, and no pursuer near; and when a friendly rain squall overtook us, and enveloping us in its folds, travelled along with us, for some distance, I felt assured that our run had been a success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>The sea continued smooth, and nothing could exceed the beauty of that night-scene, as we ran along this picturesque coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>The chief feature of the landscape was its weird-like expression, and aspect of most profound repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>Mountain, hill, and valley lay slumbering in the moonlight; no living thing except ourselves, and now and then, a coasting vessel close in with the land, that seemed also to be asleep, being seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>Dense, black clouds rolled up, from every direction, and amid the crashing, and rattling of thunder, and rapid, and blinding lightning, the rain began to fall in torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>I desired to double the north end of the island, and to enable me to do this, I endeavored, in sea phrase, to <q direct="unspecified">hold on to the land.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>The weather was so thick, and dark, at times, that we could scarcely see the length of the ship, and we were obliged often to slow down, and even stop the engine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>I slept late, nothing having been seen to render it necessary to call me. When I came on deck, the weather still looked angry, with a dense bank of rain-clouds hanging over the islands we had left, and the stiff northeaster blowing as freshly as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>In the afternoon, a large ship was descried running down in our direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>When she approached sufficiently near, we hoisted again the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, and hove her to with a gun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>The wind was blowing quite fresh, but the master and his papers were soon brought on board, when it appeared <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> that our prize was the <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Montmorency</rs>, of <placeName reg="Bath, Sagadahoc, Maine" key="tgn,7015765">Bath, Maine</placeName>, from <placeName key="tgn,7008844;tgn,7008843" n="0.012 000000.1240	placename;tgn,7008844;name,Newport,Wales,United Kingdom,Europe;0.012 000000.1240	placename;tgn,7008843;name,Pembrokeshire,Wales,United Kingdom,Europe" reg="name,Newport,Wales,United Kingdom,Europe;name,Pembrokeshire,Wales,United Kingdom,Europe">Newport, in Wales</placeName>, and bound to <placeName key="tgn,7005136;tgn,7013107" n="0.066 000000.1983	placename;tgn,7005136;Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America;0.033 000000.0992	placename;tgn,7013107;saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America" reg="Saint Thomas, Virgin Islands,Virgin Islands of the United States,North and Central America;saint thomas, ontario,Ontario,Canada,North and Central America">St. Thomas</placeName>, with a cargo of coal, for the <rs>English</rs> mail-steamers rendezvousing at that island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Her cargo being properly documented, as <name>English</name> property, we could not destroy her, but put her under a ransom bond, for her supposed value, and released her.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>I began, now, to find that the <rs>Yankee</rs> masters, mates, and sailors rather liked being parolled; they would sometimes remind us of it, if they thought we were in danger of forgetting it. It saved them from being conscripted, unless the enemy was willing <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to exchange them; and nothing went so hard with the enemy as to exchange a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>With cold-blooded cruelty, the enemy had already counted his chances of success, as based upon the relative numbers of the <num value="2">two</num> combatants, and found that, by killing a given number of our prisoners by long confinement&mdash;the same number of his being killed by us, by the same process&mdash;he could beat us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>In pursuance of this diabolical policy, he threw every possible difficulty in the way of exchanges, and toward the latter part of the war put a stop to them nearly entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>Our prisons were crowded with his captured soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>We were hard pressed for provisions, and found it difficult to feed them, and we were even destitute of medicines and hospital stores, owing to the barbarous nature of the war that was being made upon us. Not even a bottle of quinine or an ounce of calomel was allowed to cross the border, if the enemy could prevent it. With a full knowledge of these facts, he permitted his soldiers to sigh and weep away their lives in a hopeless captivity&mdash;coolly <q direct="unspecified">calculating,</q> that <num value="1">one</num> Confederate life was worth, when weighed in the balance of final success, from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="4">four</num> of the lives of his own men!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>The enemy, since the war, has become alarmed at the atrocity of his conduct, and at the judgment which posterity will be likely to pass upon it, and has set himself at work, to falsify <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> history, with his usual disregard of truth.

A ship of war being seen to windward, running down in our direction, we beat to quarters, and hoisted the U. S. colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>She was a heavy ship, but being a sailing vessel, we had nothing to fear, even if she should prove to be an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>Indeed, it would have been only sport for us, to fall in with <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's old time sailing-frigates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>Our agile little steamer, with her single longrange gun, could have knocked her into pie, as the printers say, before the majestic old thing could turn round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>It was in the morning watch, when holystones and sand, and scrubbing-brushes and soap were the order of the hour, and we surprised the stranger, consequently, in her morning dishabille, for her rigging was filled with scrubbed hammocks, and a number of well-filled clothes-lines were stretched between her main and mizzen shrouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>She proved to be Spanish; and was steering apparently for the island of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>By the way, <num value="1">one</num> of my amusements, now, was to wind and compare a number of chronometers, daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>The nautical instruments were almost the only things, except provisions, and clothing for the crew, that we could remove from our prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>I never permitted any other species of property to be brought on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>We had no room for it, and could not have disposed of it, except by violating the laws of neutral nations, and converting our ship into a trader; neither <num value="1">one</num> of which comported with the duties which I had in hand, viz., the rapid destruction <pb id="p.269" n="269"/> of the enemy's commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>I should have had no objection to receiving, on deposit, for safe keeping, any funds that I might have found on board the said prizes, but the beggarly <name>Yankee</name> masters never carried any. A few <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure> for ship's expenses was all that was ever found, and sometimes not even this&mdash;the master having, generally, an order on his consignee, for what moneys he might need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>I sometimes captured these orders, and a stray bill of exchange for a small amount, but of course I could make no use of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>The steamship has not only revolutionized commerce, and war, but exchanges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>Long before the arrival of the tardy sailing-ship, at her destined port, with her ponderous cargo, the nimble mail-steamer deposits a duplicate of her invoice, and bill of lading, with the merchant to whom she is consigned; and when the ship has landed her cargo, the same, or another steamer, takes back a bill of exchange, for the payment of the freight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2963"/>The masters of my prizes frequently remonstrated against my capturing their chronometers; in some instances claiming them as their own individual property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2964"/>When they would talk to me about private property, I would ask to whom their ships belonged&mdash;whether to a private person, or the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2965"/>They at once saw the drift of the question, and there was an end of the argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2966"/>I was making war upon the enemy's commerce&mdash;and especially upon the ship, the vehicle of commerce, and the means and appliances by which she was navigated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2967"/>If her chronometers, sextants, telescopes, and charts were left in possession of the master, they would be transferred to, and used in the navigation of some other ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2968"/>The fact that these instruments belonged to other parties, than the shipowners, could not make the least difference&mdash;ship and instruments were all private property, alike, and alike subject to capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2982"/>The owner of the staves had not thought it worth while to certify, that his property was neutral, and so we had no difficulty with the papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2983"/>We had not made much of a prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>I clambered to the weather side of the ship, and seeing that she must go down in a few minutes, set my first lieutenant at work to extricate the only boat that was available&mdash;the weather-quarter boat, all <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> the others being submerged&mdash;from her fastenings, to save as much life as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>This was fortunately done, and the boat being put in charge of a midshipman, the non-combatant officers, as the surgeon and paymaster; the midshipmen, and such of the boys of the ship as could not swim, were permitted to get into her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3110"/>The next day, the weather culminated, sure enough, in a gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3111"/>The barometer began to settle, in the morning watch, and dense black clouds, looking ragged and windy, soon obscured the sun, and spread an ominous pall over the entire heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3112"/>I at once put the ship under easy sail; that is to say, clewed up everything but the topsails and trysails, and awaited the further progress of the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3113"/>The wind was as yet light, but the barometer, which had stood at <num value="29">29</num>&deg; <num value="70">70</num>&prime; at <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, had fallen to <num value="29">29</num>&deg; <num value="59">59</num>&prime; by <time value="2pm">two P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3114"/>It was time to reef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3115"/>All hands were turned up, and the close reefs were taken, both in topsails and trysails; the jib hauled down and stowed, and the top-gallant yards sent down from aloft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3117"/>It now began to blow furiously from this latter quarter, the squalls being accompanied by a driving, blinding rain; the barometer going down, ominously down, all the while.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3118"/>As the night closed in, an awful scene presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3119"/>The aspect of the heavens was terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3120"/>The black clouds overhead were advancing and retreating like squadrons of opposing armies, whilst loud peals of thunder, and blinding flashes of lightning that would now and then run down the conductor, and hiss as they leaped into the sea, added to the elemental strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3121"/>A streaming scud, which you could almost touch with your hand, was meanwhile hurrying past, screeching and screaming, like so many demons, as it rushed through the rigging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3122"/>The sea was mountainous, and would now and then strike the little <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> with such force as to make her tremble in every fibre of her frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3123"/>I had remained on deck during most of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> watch, looking anxiously on, to see what sort of weather we were going to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3124"/>The ship <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> behaved nobly, but I had no confidence in her strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3125"/>Her upper works, in particular, were very defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3126"/>Her bends, above the main deck, were composed of light pine stanchions and inch plank, somewhat strengthened in the bows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3127"/>Seeing the fury of the gale, and that the barometer was still settling, I went below about midnight, and turned in to get a little rest, with many misgivings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3128"/>I had scarcely fallen into an uneasy slumber, when an old quartermaster, looking himself like the demon of the storm, with his dishevelled hair and beard dripping water, and his eyes blinking in the light of his lantern, shook my cot, and said, <q direct="unspecified">We've stove in the starboard bowport, sir, and the gun-deck is all afloat with water!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3129"/>Here was what I had feared; unless we could keep the water out of the between-decks, all the upper works, and the masts along with them, would be gone in a trice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3130"/>I hurried at once to the scene of disaster, but before I could reach it, my energetic and skilful first lieutenant had already, by the aid of some planks and spare spars, erected a barricade that would be likely to answer our purpose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>The gale lulled somewhat in an hour or <num value="2">two</num> afterward, and I now got some sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>I was on deck again, however, at daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>The same thick gloom overspread the heavens, the scud was flying as furiously, and as low as before, and the gale was raging as fiercely as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>But we had <num value="1">one</num> great comfort, and that was <hi rend="italics">daylight</hi>. We could see the ship and the heavens&mdash;there was nothing else visible&mdash;and this alone divested the gale of half its terrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>At last, at <time value="6am">six A. M.</time>, the barometer reached its lowest point, <num value="29.32">29.32</num>, which, in the latitude we were in, was a very low barometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who has watched a barometer under similar circumstances, will understand the satisfaction with which I saw the little tell-tale begin to rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>It whispered to me as intelligibly as if it had been a living thing, <q direct="unspecified">the gale is broken!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>We had been lying to, all this time, under a close-reefed main-topsail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>We now bore up under a reefed foresail, and kept the ship on her course, east by south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>She scudded as beautifully as she had lain to, darting ahead like an arrow, on the tops of the huge waves that followed her like so many hungry wolves, and shaking the foam and spray from her bows, as if in disdain and contempt of the lately howling storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>It is the suddenness with which the idea of danger presents itself, quite as much as the extent of the danger, which intimidates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>We were then beating the enemy, and the nations of the earth were worshipping success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>So large a fleet of ships&mdash;not being a convoy&mdash;so far out at sea, was quite a curiosity, and may serve to show the landsman how accurately we have mapped out, upon the ocean, the <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> principal highways of commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>There were no mile-posts on the road these ships were travelling, it is true, but the road was none the less <q direct="unspecified">blazed</q> out, for all that&mdash;the blazes being on the wind and current charts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>The night succeeding this busy day set in cloudy and ugly, with a fresh breeze blowing from the eastward; and so continuous was the stream of ships, all sailing in the contrary direction from ourselves, that we had serious apprehensions of being run over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>To guard against this, we set our side-lights, and stationed extra lookouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>Several ships passed us during the night, hurrying forward on the wings of the wind, at a rapid rate, and sometimes coming so close, in the darkness, as almost to make <num value="1">one</num>'s hair stand on end. The next morning the weather became clear and beautiful, and the stream of ships had ceased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>The reader may be curious to know the explanation of this current of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>It is simple enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>They were all Mediterranean ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>At the <placeName reg="Strait of Gibraltar" key="tgn,1115137">strait of Gibraltar</placeName> there is a constant current setting into the <name>Mediterranean</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>This current is of considerable strength, and the consequence is, that when the wind also sets into the strait&mdash;that is to say, when it is from the westward&mdash;it is impossible for a sailing-ship to get out of the strait into the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>She is obliged to come to anchor in the bay of <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName>, and wait for a change of wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>This is sometimes a long time in coming&mdash;the westerly winds continuing here, not unfrequently, <num value="2">two</num> and <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>As a matter of course, a large number of ships collect in the bay, waiting for an opportunity of exit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>I have seen as many as a <num value="100">hundred</num> sail at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>In a few hours after a change of wind takes place, this immense fleet will all be under way, and such of them as are bound to the equator and the coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000047;tgn,2031163" n="0.012 000000.7068	placename;tgn,1000047;brasil,South America;0.010 000000.6316	placename;tgn,2031163;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="brasil,South America;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America">Brazil</placeName>, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, and <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, will be found travelling the blazed road of which I have spoken; some taking the forks of the road, at their respective branching-off places, and others keeping the main track to the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>Hence the exodus the reader has witnessed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>Perhaps the reader needs another explanation&mdash;how it was, that amid all that fleet of ships, there was not <num value="1">one</num> Yankee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>This explanation is almost as easy as the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>Commerce <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> is a sensitive plant, and at the rude touch of war it had contracted its branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>The enemy was fast losing his Mediterranean trade, under the operation of high premiums for war risks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>We began now to observe a notable change in the weather, as affected by the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>Along the entire length of the <rs>American</rs> coast, the clear winds are the west winds, the rainwinds being the east winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>Here the rule is reversed; the west winds bringing us rains, and the east winds clear weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>The reason is quite obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>The east winds, sweeping over the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, have nearly all of their moisture wrung out of them before they reach the sea; hence the dryness of these winds, when they salute the mariner cruising along the <rs type="place">European coasts</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>Starting now from the <rs type="place">European seas</rs> as dry winds, they traverse a large extent of water before they reach the coasts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>During the whole of this travel, these thirsty winds are drinking their fill from the sea, and by the time they reach <placeName reg="Portland, Cumberland, Maine" key="tgn,7014272">Portland</placeName> or <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, they are heavily laden with moisture, which they now begin to let down again upon the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>Hence, those long, gloomy, rainy, rheumatic, easterly storms, that prevail along our coast in the <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>The reader has now only to take up the west wind, as it leaves the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName>, as a wet wind, and follow it across the <rs>American</rs> continent, and see how dry the mountains wring it before it reaches the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, to see why it should bring us fair weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/>The change was very curious to us at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, until we became a little used to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>Another change was quite remarkable, and that was the great difference in temperature which we experienced with reference to latitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>Here we were, in midwinter, or near it, off the south coast of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, in latitude <num value="36">36</num>&deg;, nearly that of <placeName key="tgn,2114427;tgn,1010773" n="0.074 000000.1488	placename;tgn,2114427;Stuart, Patrick, Virginia,Patrick,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.074 000000.1488	placename;tgn,1010773;Cape Henry, Virginia Beach, Virginia,Virginia Beach,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Stuart, Patrick, Virginia,Patrick,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Cape Henry, Virginia Beach, Virginia,Virginia Beach,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">Cape Henry</placeName> at the entrance of the <rs type="place">Chesapeake Bay</rs>, and unless the weather was wet, we had not felt the necessity of a pea-jacket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>Whence this difference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>The cause, or causes, whatever they are, must, of course, be local; for other things being equal, the heat should be the same, on the same parallel of latitude; all around the globe which we inhabit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/></p> 
<p>Modern ingenuity has suggested a beautiful mode of warming houses in winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>It is done by means of hot water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/>The furnace and the caldron are sometimes placed at a distance from the apartment to be warmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>It is so at the <name>Observatory</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>In this case, pipes are used to conduct the heated water from the caldron under the <rs>Superintendent</rs>'s dwelling, over into <num value="1">one</num> of the basement rooms of the <name>Observatory</name>, a distance of <measure n="100feet" type="distance">one hundred feet</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>The boilers were a good deal out of condition, it is true, but as they were capable of bearing a low pressure of steam, sufficient to take us to sea, the officials would not listen to my proposals to repair them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/><num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3426"/>It has been and is the uniform custom of all nations to arrest, upon request, and to hand over to their proper officers, deserters from ships of war, and this without stopping to inquire into the nationality of the deserter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3428"/>If this be the practice in peace, much more necessary does such a practice become in war, since otherwise the operations of war might be tolerated in a neutral territory, as will be seen from my next position.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3429"/><num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3430"/>Without a violation of neutrality, an enemy's consul in a neutral territory cannot be permitted to entice away seamen, from a ship of the opposite belligerent, or to shelter or protect the same: for if he be permitted to do this, then his domicil becomes an enemy's camp in a neutral territory.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>With reference to the question in hand, I respectfully submit that the only facts, which your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> can take cognizance of, are that these deserters entered the waters of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> under my flag, and that they formed a part of my crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>The inquiry cannot pass a step beyond, and <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> cannot undertake to decide, as between the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>In other words, she has no right to look into any plea set up by a deserter, that he is a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and not of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3437"/>The nationality of the deserters not being Spanish, <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> cannot, as I said before, inquire into it. To recapitulate: the case which I present is simply this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>Our Southern movement, in the eyes of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, was a mere political revolution, and like all absolute governments, she had no sympathy with revolutionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3479"/>It was too late to attempt the run to <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName> that night, with the hope of arriving at a seasonable hour, and so we <q direct="unspecified">held on,</q> in nautical phrase, to the light&mdash;that beautiful red flash which I have before described&mdash;until <time value="12am">midnight</time>, when we gave the ship her steam, and turned her head in the direction of the famous Strait, or Gut, as the sailors sometimes less euphoniously call it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3490"/>To these, therefore, we directed our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3491"/>It was a couple of hours before we came up with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>The cat ran close enough to parley with the mouse, before she put her paw upon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>And then only to think, that the sly little mouse, looking so pretty and so innocent, should have so much of that villanous material called sulphur in its little pouch!</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>The object of so wording the deposition was, of course, to save the cargo as neutral property, but as I happened to know that the <rs type="place">Boston house</rs> of the <name>Barings</name>, instead of being an agent merely, was a partner of the <rs type="place">London house</rs>, the master took nothing by his deposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>Besides, if there had been no doubt as to the <rs>British</rs> ownership, sulphur going to an enemy's country is contraband of war; and in this case the contraband of war was not only condemnable of itself, but it tainted all the rest of the cargo, which belonged to the same owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>I now found it diversified with fields, full of clover and fragrant grasses, long, well-shaded avenues, of sufficiently gentle ascent for carriage-drives, beautifully laid-out pleasuregrounds, and well-cultivated gardens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>The parade-ground is a level space just outside the southern wall, of sufficient capacity for the manoeuvre and review of <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men; and rising just south of this is the <name>Alameda</name>, consisting of a series of parterres of flowers, with shade-trees and shrubbery, among which wind a number of serpentine walks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/>There is no end to the pipe-claying, and brushing, and burnishing, in the different barracks, on the morning of this day. The officers get out their new uniforms, and horses are groomed with more than ordinary care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/>The citizens turn out, as well as the military, and all the beauty and fashion of the town are collected on the <name>Alameda</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>On the occasion of the review which I witnessed, the troops&mdash;nearly all young, fine-looking men&mdash;presented, indeed, a splendid appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3692"/>A neat little box of a house, with a signal-mast and yard, and a small plot of ground, about as large as a pocket-handkerchief, used as a garden, occupied the whole space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>And they did indeed look sad and disconsolate enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>Not so, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>These Englishmen are a sort of cross between <pb id="p.326" n="326"/> the <name>Centaur</name> and the <rs>North American Indian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>And so we rode to the <q direct="unspecified">neutral ground.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/></p> 
<p>This is a narrow strip of territory, accurately set off by metes and bounds, on the isthmus that separates the <rs type="place">Rock</rs> from the <rs>Spanish</rs> territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>I got back to my ship just in time for a <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> dinner, astonished <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> by drinking an extra glass of sherry, and could hardly walk for a week afterward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/>A day or <num value="2">two</num> after my visit to the <rs type="place">Rock</rs>, I received a visit from a Spanish naval lieutenant, sent over, as he stated, by the <rs>Admiral</rs> from Algeziras, to remonstrate with me against the burning of the <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Neapolitan within Spanish jurisdiction</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>The reader who has read the description of the burning of that ship, will be as much astonished as I was at this visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/>The Spanish Government owns the fortress of Ceuta, on the <pb id="p.327" n="327"/> <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> shore opposite <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName>, and by virtue of this ownership claims, as it would appear, jurisdiction for a marine league at sea, in the neighborhood of the fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>It was claimed that the <hi rend="italics">Neapolitan</hi> had been captured within this league.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>The lieutenant having thus stated his case, I demanded to know on what testimony the <rs>Admiral</rs> relied, to establish the fact of the burning within the league.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>He replied that the <orgName n="U. S. Consul" type="org">United States Consul</orgName> at <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName> had made the statement to the <rs>Admiral</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>Here was the <q direct="unspecified">cat out of the bag</q> again; another <orgName n="U. S. Consul" type="org">United States Consul</orgName> had turned up, with his intrigues and false statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>The nice little piece of diplomacy had probably been helped on, too, by the commanders of the <rs>Federal</rs> ships of war, that had made Algeziras a rendezvous, since I had been anchored in the <rs type="place">Bay of Gibraltar</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/>When the <rs>Spanish</rs> officer had done stating his case, I said to him:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">I do not recognize the right of your <rs type="role2">Admiral</rs> to raise any question with me, as to my capture of the <hi rend="italics">Neapolitan</hi>. The capture of that ship is an accomplished fact, and if any injury has been done thereby to <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 11" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, the <rs>Spanish Government</rs> can complain of it to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>It has passed beyond the stage, when the <rs>Admiral</rs> and I could manage it, and has become an affair entirely between our <num value="2">two</num> Governments.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/></p> 
<p>This was all the official answer I had to make, and the lieutenant, whose bearing was that of an intelligent gentleman, assented to the correctness of my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>I then said to him:&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">But aside from the official aspect of the case, I desire to show you, that your <rs type="role2">Admiral</rs> has had his credulity played upon by his informant, the <rs>Consul</rs>, and whatever other parties may have approached him on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>They have made false statements to him. It is not only well known to hundreds of citizens of the <rs type="place">Rock</rs>, who were eye-witnesses of the burning of the <hi rend="italics">Neapolitan</hi>, that that vessel was burned at a distance of from <num value="6">six</num> to <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> from the <rs type="place">African coast</rs>, but I have the testimony of the master of the captured vessel himself, to the same effect.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>I then sent for my clerk, whom I directed to produce and read the deposition of the master, which, according to custom, we had taken immediately upon effecting the capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>In that deposition, after <pb id="p.328" n="328"/> having been duly sworn, the master had stated that the capture was made about <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Europa Point,Gibraltar,Europe" key="tgn,1011865">Europa Point</placeName></placeName>, the southern extremity of the <rs type="place">Rock of Gibraltar</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>The <rs type="place">Strait</rs> is about <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> wide at this point, which would put the ship, when captured, <placeName><distance reg="9miles">nine miles</distance> from Ceuta</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>The lieutenant, at the conclusion of the reading, raised both hands, and with an expressive smile, ejaculated, <hi rend="italics"><q direct="unspecified">Es possible?</q></hi> <q direct="unspecified">Yes,</q> I replied, <q direct="unspecified">all things are possible to Federal Consuls, and other Federal pimps and spies, when the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> and <name>Yankee</name> ships are concerned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>In other words, this article has been pronounced, like provisions, innoxious; and this being the case, it can make no difference whether it be supplied by the <rs>Government</rs> or an individual (the <rs>Government</rs> being reimbursed the expense), and this even though the market were open to me. Much more then may the <rs>Government</rs> supply me with an innocent article, the market not being open to me.

<p>The true criterion is, not whether the <rs>Government</rs> or an individual may supply the article, but whether the article itself be noxious or innoxious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3781"/>The Government may not supply me with powder&mdash;why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3782"/>Not because I may have recourse to the market, but because the article itself is interdicted.

<p>Whilst I thank you for the courtesy of delivering my letter, as requested, I must be permitted to express to you my disappointment at the course which you have prescribed to yourself, of refraining from expressing any opinion to the <rs>Moorish Government</rs>, of the legality or illegality of its act, lest you should be charged with undue interference.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>I had supposed that the <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics"><persName n="Trent,,,,," id="n0133.0026.00337.00760" reg="mostcommon:Trent,nomatch:0"><surname>Trent</surname></persName></hi> affair,</q> of so recent occurrence, had settled, not only the right, but the duty of the civilized nations of the earth to <q direct="unspecified">interfere,</q> in a friendly manner, to prevent wars between nations.

In that affair a quarrel arose between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the belligerents in the existing war, and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, a neutral in that war; and instead of <q direct="unspecified">refraining</q> from offering advice, all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> made haste to volunteer it to both parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>Neither the nation giving the advice nor the nation advised, supposed for a moment that there was a breach of neutrality in this proceeding; on the contrary, it was the general verdict of mankind, that the course pursued was not only legal, but eminently humane and proper, as tending to allay excitement, and prevent the effusion of blood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>If you will run a parallel between the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Trent,,,,," id="n0133.0026.00337.00761" reg="mostcommon:Trent,nomatch:0"><surname>Trent</surname></persName></hi> case, and the case in hand, you will find it difficult, I think, to sustain the reason you have assigned for your forbearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>In that case, the quarrel rel was between a neutral, and a belligerent, as in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>In that case, citizens of a belligerent State were unlawfully arrested <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> on the high seas, in a neutral ship, by the opposite belligerent, and imprisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>In this case, citizens of a belligerent State have been unlawfully arrested by a neutral, in neutral territory, and imprisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>Does the fact that the offence was committed in the former case, by a belligerent against a neutral, and in the latter ease, by a neutral against a belligerent, make any difference in the application of the principle we are discussing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>And if so, in what does the difference consist?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>If A strikes B, is it lawful to interfere to preserve the peace, and if B strikes A, is it unlawful to interfere for the same purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>Can the circumstance, that the prisoners seized by the <num value="1">one</num> belligerent, in the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Trent,,,,," id="n0133.0026.00338.00762" reg="mostcommon:Trent,nomatch:0"><surname>Trent</surname></persName></hi> affair, were citizens of the other belligerent, alter the application of the principle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>The difference, if any, is in favor of the present case, for whilst the belligerent in the former case was compelled to release its enemies, whom, under proper conditions it would have had the right to capture, in the latter case I requested you to advise a neutral to release prisoners, who were not the enemies of the neutral, and whom the neutral could have no right to capture under any circumstances whatever.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>Upon further inquiry, I learn that my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression, that the <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen in question had been arrested under some claim of extradition, was not exactly correct.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4200"/>We must now pause, for we have brought the thread of the war down to the commissioning of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and the reader will see with what forebodings, as well as hopes, we took the sea, in that ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4201"/>The war may be said now to have been at its height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4202"/>Both the belligerents were thoroughly aroused, and a few blows, well struck, on the water, might be of great assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4203"/>I resolved to attempt to strike these blows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4204"/>A few words, now, as to the <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/>As remarked in the opening of these memoirs, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had no navy at the beginning of the war, and the <rs>South</rs> being almost entirely agricultural, with few or no ships, and but little external commerce, except such as was conducted in Northern bottoms, had but very indifferent means of creating <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4206"/>Whilst the <rs>North</rs> was <num value="1">one</num> busy hive of manufacturing industry, with its ship-yards and work-shops, resounding, by night and by day, with the busy-strokes of the hammer, the adze, and the caulking-iron; whilst its steam-mills and foundries were vomiting forth their thick smoke from their furnaces, and deafening the ears of their workmen by the din of the trip-hammer and the whirr of the lathe; and whilst foreign material of every description was flowing into open ports, the <rs>South</rs> had neither ship-yards nor work-shops, steam-mills nor foundries, except on the most limited scale, and all her ports were as good as hermetically sealed, so far as the introduction of the heavy materials of which she stood in need was concerned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4207"/>It will be seen what a difficult task the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> had before him, and how unjust are many of the censures that were cast upon him, by persons unconversant with naval affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4208"/>Indeed, it is rather a matter of surprise, that so much was accomplished with our limited means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/>Work-shops <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> and foundries were improvised, wherever it was possible to establish them; but the great difficulty was the want of the requisite heavy machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>We had not the means, in the entire Confederacy, of turning out a complete steam-engine, of any size, and many of our naval disasters are attributable to this deficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>Well-constructed steamers, that did credit to the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> and its agents, were forced to put to sea, and to move about upon our sounds and harbors, with engines disproportioned to their size, and incapable of driving them at a speed greater than <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> the hour.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4212"/>The casting of cannon, and the manufacture of small arms, were also undertaken by the <rs>Secretary</rs>, under the direction of skilful officers, and prosecuted to considerable efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4213"/>But it took time to accomplish all these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4214"/>Before a ship could be constructed, it was necessary to hunt up the requisite timber, and transport it considerable distances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>Her armor, if she was to be armored, was to be rolled also at a distance, and transported over long lines of railroad, piecemeal; her cordage was to be picked up at <num value="1">one</num> place, and her sails and hammocks at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4216"/>I speak knowingly on this subject, as I had had experience of many of the difficulties I mention, in fitting out the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4217"/>I was <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> in preparing this small ship for sea, practising, all the while, every possible diligence and contrivance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4218"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> had other difficulties to contend with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4219"/>By the time he had gotten many of his ship-yards well established, and ships well on their way to completion, the enemy would threaten the <hi rend="italics">locus in quo</hi>, by land, and either compel him to attempt to remove everything movable, in great haste, and at great loss, or destroy it, to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4220"/>Many fine ships were, in this way, burned on the very eve of completion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4221"/>It must be recollected, too, that in the early days of the war, we had no finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4222"/>These were to be improvised along with other things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4223"/>I travelled to the <rs>North</rs>, on the mission which has been described in these pages, on money borrowed from a private banker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4224"/>If we had had plenty of funds in the beginning of the war, it is possible that we might have accomplished more than we did, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in the matter of getting out <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> ships to prey upon the enemy's commerce&mdash;that is, in the way of purchase, for it soon became evident, from the experience we had had, in building the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and other ships contracted for by the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName>, that we could not rely upon constructing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4225"/>The neutral powers became too watchful, and were too much afraid of the <rs>Federal</rs> power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4226"/>When the <rs>Government</rs> did put the <rs>Secretary</rs> in funds, several months had elapsed, the war had begun, the coast was blockaded, and all the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> were on the alert.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4227"/>With reference to the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>, a few words will describe the changes which had taken place in its organization, since I last referred to the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4228"/>It will be recollected that it then consisted of but <num value="4">four</num> captains, <num value="4">four</num> commanders, and about <num value="30">thirty</num> lieutenants, and that the writer was the junior, but <num value="1">one</num>, of the <num value="4">four</num> commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4229"/>A considerable accession was made to the navy-list, as <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and other States seceded, and joined their fortunes with those of their more impulsive sisters, the <rs>Cotton States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4230"/>A number of old officers, past service, disdaining to eat the bread of ignoble pensioners upon the bounty of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, which were seeking to subjugate the <name>States</name> of their birth or adoption, came South, bringing with them nothing but their patriotism and their gray hairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4231"/>These all took rank, as has been remarked, according to the positions they had held in the old service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4232"/>These old gentlemen, whilst they would have commanded, with great credit, fleets and squadrons of well-appointed and well-officered ships, were entirely unsuited for such service as the <rs>Confederacy</rs> could offer them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4233"/>It became necessary, in consequence, to re-organize the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>; and although this was not done until <dateStruct value="1863-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, some months after the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was commissioned, I will anticipate the subject here, to avoid the necessity of again referring to it. I had been promoted to the rank of captain in the <rs>Regular Navy</rs>, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4234"/>The Act of <dateStruct value="1863-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, established what was called the <rs>Provisional Navy</rs>; the object being, without interfering with the rank of the officers in the <rs>Regular Navy</rs>, to cull out from that navy list, younger and more active men, and put them in the <rs>Provisional Navy</rs>, with increased rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4235"/>The Regular Navy became, thus, a kind of retired list, and the <rs>Secretary</rs> of the <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> Navy was enabled to accomplish his object of bringing forward younger officers for active service, without wounding the feelings of the older officers, by promoting their juniors over their heads, <hi rend="italics">on the same list</hi>. As late as <dateStruct value="1861-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, we had had no admirals in our Navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4236"/>On the <dateStruct value="--24"><day reg="2">24th</day></dateStruct> of that month, the <name>Act</name> organizing the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> was so amended, as to authorize the appointment of <num value="4">four</num> officers of this grade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4237"/>There was but <num value="1">one</num> of these admirals appointed, up to the time of which I am writing&mdash;Buchanan, who was promoted for his gallant fight in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi>, with the enemy's fleet in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4239"/>I was thus, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> in rank in the <rs>Provisional Navy</rs>, soon after I hoisted my pennant on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. In reviewing these matters, my only regret now is, that the older officers of whom I have spoken, and who made so many sacrifices for principle&mdash;sacrifices that have hastened several of them to the tomb, were not made admirals on the regular or retired list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4240"/>The honors would have been barren, it is true, as no commands, commensurate with the rank, could have been given them, but the bestowal of the simple title would have been a compliment, no more than due to veterans, who had commanded squadrons in the old service, and who had abandoned all for the sake of their States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4269"/>The reader will see, in a moment, that there is nothing in this objection, when he reflects that a ship of war, in the light in which we are considering her, is a <hi rend="italics">personification</hi>, and not a mere material thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4271"/>It is the commission which a sovereign puts on board a ship, that causes her to personify the sovereign power, and it is obviously of no importance how the sovereign becomes possessed of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4293"/>Our question, then; will be reduced to this, Was she commissioned by a sovereign power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4294"/>The answer to this question is, that a <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> government is sovereign, for all the purposes of war, and that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were a <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> government; so acknowledged by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> themselves, as well as by the other nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4295"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> made this acknowledgment, the moment <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0133.0029.00375.00942" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:8"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> issued his proclamation declaring a blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports; and they acted upon the doctrine that we were belligerents during the whole war, by treating with us for the exchange of <hi rend="italics">prisoners of war</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4296"/>This was no concession on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4297"/>We had become strong enough to compel them to this course, in spite of themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4298"/>In other words, we had become strong enough to make <hi rend="italics">war</hi>, and when this is the case, let us see what Vattel says is the duty of the other party: <q direct="unspecified">The sovereign indeed, never fails to bestow the appellation of <q direct="unspecified">rebels</q> on all such of his subjects as openly resist him; but when the latter have acquired sufficient strength to give him effectual opposition, and to oblige him to carry on the war against them, according to the established rules, he must necessarily submit to the use of the term <quote>civil war.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4299"/>It is foreign to our purpose in this place, to weigh the reasons which may authorize and justify a civil war. We have elsewhere treated of cases in which subjects may resist their sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4300"/>Setting, therefore, the justice of the case wholly out of the question, it only remains for us to consider the maxims which ought to be observed in a civil war, and to explain whether the sovereign is, on such occasions, <pb id="p.376" n="376"/> bound to conform to the established laws of war. A civil war breaks the bands of society and government, or at least suspends their force and effect; it produces in the nation <num value="2">two</num> independent parties, which consider each other as enemies, and acknowledge no common judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4301"/>These <num value="2">two</num> parties, therefore, must necessarily be considered as constituting, at least for a time, <num value="2">two</num> separate bodies, <num value="2">two</num> distinct societies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4302"/>Though <num value="1">one</num> of the parties may have been to blame in breaking the unity of the <rs>State</rs>, and resisting the lawful authority, they are not the less divided in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4303"/>Besides, who shall judge them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4304"/>Who shall pronounce on which side the right or wrong lies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4305"/>On earth they have no common superior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4306"/>They stand, therefore, in precisely the same predicament as <num value="2">two</num> nations, who engage in a contest, and being unable to come to an agreement, have recourse to arms.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4307"/>This was the law of nations as expounded by Vattel more than a century ago. He tells us that when even a revolt or rebellion has acquired sufficient magnitude and strength, to make <q direct="unspecified">effectual opposition to the sovereign,</q> it is the duty of that sovereign to talk of <q direct="unspecified">civil war,</q> and not of <q direct="unspecified">rebellion,</q> and to cease to call his former subjects <q direct="unspecified">rebels.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4308"/>How much more was it the duty of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, in a war which was a war from the beginning, waged by States against States, with all the forms and solemnities of war, and with none of the characteristics of a secret revolt or rebellion, to treat us as belligerents, even if they denied the <hi rend="italics">de jures</hi> of our movement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4309"/>But even according to the law laid down by Vattel, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> stood <q direct="unspecified">precisely in the same predicament,</q> with regard to all the rights, duties, and obligations growing out of the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4310"/>Hence it follows, that if the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could build <hi rend="italics">Alabamas</hi>, and capture the ships of her enemy, so could the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4333"/>In St. Bartholomew we found at anchor a Buenos Ayrean cruiser called the <hi rend="italics">Federal</hi>. This was a Baltimore-built schooner&mdash;Baltimore in those days being famous above all the other American ports, for building fast vessels of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>This vessel, we ascertained, had boarded an American ship a few days before, and taken from on board of her a portion of her cargo, under the pretence that it was Spanish property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>This being in our view a violation of the laws of nations (as whether the property was Spanish or not, we held that <q direct="unspecified">free ships made free goods</q> ), we resolved to commit <num value="1">one</num> of those outrages against neutral rights which have become so common our day, by seizing the cruiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>Admitting the act of the cruiser to have been wrongful, the argument, so far as her seizure by us was concerned, was all against us, and might have been contained in a <pb id="p.380" n="380"/> <q direct="unspecified">nutshell;</q> but our captain, if he had ever read any international law, which was exceedingly doubtful, had read it, like <persName n="Wilkes,,,,," id="n0133.0029.00380.00958" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, wrong end foremost, and <q direct="unspecified">went it blind,</q> being quite sure of popular applause from the b'hoys at home, and standing in no fear of consequences so far as <placeName key="tgn,2204227" n="1.000 10" reg="Buenos Aires, Pima, Arizona">Buenos Ayres</placeName> was concerned, as she was so weak that the <orgName n="Great Republic" type="newspaper">Great Republic</orgName> might kick her with impunity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4338"/>We <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> demanded her of the <rs>Governor</rs> of the island, as a <q direct="unspecified">pirate.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4339"/>The Governor replied, that she was a commissioned ship, with a <hi rend="italics">defacto</hi> government behind her, and that she could not, so long as she retained this character, be guilty of piracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4340"/>Further, that if she were a pirate, she was <hi rend="italics">hostis humani generis</hi>, and <placeName key="tgn,1000097" n="1.000 73" reg="sverige">Sweden</placeName>, within whose waters she was, was as competent to deal with her, as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4345"/>I have mentioned the incident to show, that the very cruisers which the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> was protecting by its decisions, were nothing more than American vessels, under belligerent flags, holding commissions under <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> governments.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>But I have another precedent or <num value="2">two</num>, to which to call the attention of the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>It is a very useful practice for nations to pause occasionally, and look back upon their own history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4348"/>It teaches them many lessons, which they would not otherwise learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4349"/>It shows them how to avoid inconsistencies, and prevents them from becoming dishonest as circumstances change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4350"/>But, above all, it teaches them that man is a poor, weak creature, <pb id="p.381" n="381"/> selfish and corrupt, guided by the instincts and inspirations of the moment; and that his reason&mdash;that <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-like attribute, which distinguishes him from the brute&mdash;is so fallible, that he rarely sees a truth, if that truth militate against his supposed interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4351"/>It makes all the difference in the world, whether a man's bull gores his neighbor's ox, or his neighbor's bull gores his ox. The <name n="United States">Yankee</name> ship-owners and ship-masters cried out, in pain, as the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> and <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> were capturing and destroying their ships, and called both of these <term type="ship">cruisers</term> <rs type="ship">pirates.</rs> I design now to show how the <name n="United States">Yankee</name> ship-owners and ship-masters, of a generation or <num value="2">two</num> back, captured and burned <name>English</name> ships, and took great credit to themselves for their exploits, not dreaming that they were pirates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4352"/>The precedents which I design to cite will be drawn from the history of the war of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>; it will be necessary, therefore to run a brief parallel between that war and the war of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, to show that the precedents established in the former are applicable to the circumstances of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4353"/>To lay aside, entirely, the question of the right of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to secede, and to put the war between the <name>States</name> on no higher ground than that between the <name>Colonies</name> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, which was a mere rebellion, the following parallel appears:&mdash; The original <num value="13">thirteen</num> Colonies, when they formed a part of the <rs>British Government</rs>, declared their independence of that Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4354"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> did the same against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> made war upon the <name>Colonies</name> in consequence of this declaration; so did the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4355"/>The Colonies claimed and exercised the rights of war. So did the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4356"/>The Colonies, in the exercise of these rights, destroyed much of the commerce of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4357"/>So did the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, with regard to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4358"/>Both the <name>Colonies</name> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> governments, when this property was destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4359"/>Now, it can obviously make no difference that the <name>Colonies</name> achieved their independence, and that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> failed to achieve theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>If what the <name>Colonies</name> did <hi rend="italics">was right, when they did it&mdash;that</hi> is to say, when they were still a <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> government&mdash;what the <rs>Confederate</rs> <pb id="p.382" n="382"/> States did must have been right for the same reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>The acknowledgment of the independence of the <name>Colonies</name> by the parent country, whilst it had the effect to make them so many nations of the earth, could add nothing to any rights they before possessed, as belligerents, for they did not derive these rights from their status <hi rend="italics">de jure</hi>, but from their status <hi rend="italics">de facto;</hi> nor did they derive them from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, but from the laws of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4362"/>It follows, that if nothing could be added to these rights by the successful termination of the war, so nothing could be taken away from them, by its unsuccessful termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>The parallel thus appears perfect, in every particular, so far as belligerent rights are concerned, and, of course, it is only of these rights that we are now speaking.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>With reference to this class of vessels, the historian tells us that <q direct="unspecified">Most of the <name>Colonies</name> had their respective cruisers at sea or on their own coasts, and the ocean literally began to swarm with privateers from all parts of the country, though <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> took the lead in that species of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/><pb id="p.383" n="383"/></p> 
<p>In another place, the historian tells us, that <q direct="unspecified">As soon as the struggle commenced in earnest, the habits of the people, their aptitude for sea-service, and the advantages of both a public and <hi rend="italics">private</hi> nature, that were to be obtained from successful cruising, induced <num value="1000">thousands</num> to turn their longing eyes to an element that promised so many flattering results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>Nothing but the caution of Congress, which body was indisposed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to act as if general warfare, instead of a redress of grievances, was its object, prevented a rushing toward the <hi rend="italics">private cruisers</hi>, that would probably have given the commerce of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> a heavier and more sudden blow than it had ever yet received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4378"/>The rush was not, it seems, to the ships of war of the regular navy, to fight the battles of the country, but to the privateers, which promised so many <q direct="unspecified">flattering results.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4403"/>The consequence was, that there was no such thing known, as a stringent blockade; for the simple reason, that every gale of wind which arose, blew off the blockading ships from before the blockaded ports, and it was, sometimes, days before they could regain their stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>Besides, it is well known to readers of American history, that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> did not, at any time during the <name>Colonial</name> war, attempt to blockade all the ports of the <name>Colonies</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>The Colonial cruisers had, therefore, at all times during the entire war, some of their ports open into which to send their prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4409"/>In the meantime, the great and powerful steamship has made her appearance upon the scene, revolutionizing not only the commerce of the world, but the navies of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> months of the war, all the principal ports of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> were blockaded, and it was not long before every little nook and inlet was either in possession of the enemy, or had <num value="1">one</num> or more ships watching it. These ships were not the old-time sailing ships, dependent upon the winds and the weather for efficiency&mdash;they were steamers, independent of both, having the ability <q direct="unspecified">to hold on</q> to the blockaded port, both by day and by night, with a tenacity little less than that of fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>Though it was possible for fast steam blockade-runners, taking advantage of the darkness, sometimes to elude the vigilance of these patient watchers, it was utterly impossible for a sailing vessel to do so&mdash;and with a rare exception, here and there, all my prizes would be sailing ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>Not only were all the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports thus hermetically sealed to me, but the ports of neutrals had also been closed against me, as the reader has seen, by unfriendly proclamations and orders in council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>In short, during my whole career upon the sea, <hi rend="italics">I had not so much as a single port open to me, into which I could send a prize</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>What was expected of me under these circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>I had shown every disposition, as the reader has seen, to avoid the necessity of burning my prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>There was nothing left for me but to destroy my prizes, and this course had been forced upon me, by the nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>How senseless and unjust, then, was the clamor raised against me on this subject; especially in the light of the precedents which the enemy himself had set me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>Some senseless prints even went so far as to declare that it was in violation of the laws of war; but what is it that newspapers will not says during such a contest as that through which we have passed, when reason is dethroned by the passions, and no longer sits in the judgment seat?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>The right to destroy is as perfect, as the <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> right to sell, or make any other disposition of the captured ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>But has a captor the right to destroy before adjudication?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>the reader may ask. Certainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>The enemy has no right to adjudication at all. Courts of Admiralty are not established for him. He has, and can have no standing in such court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>He cannot even enter an appearance there, either in person, or by attorney; and if he could, he would have nothing to show, for his very <hi rend="italics">status</hi> as an enemy would be sufficient ground for condemning all the property he might claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>It is only neutrals who can claim adjudication, and it is for the benefit of these alone that Courts of Admiralty have been established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4427"/>And if any neutrals have suffered in the late war, for want of adjudication, the fault is with their own government, and not with the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> cruisers, as the reader has just seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4518"/></p> 
<p>There is <num value="1">one</num> other point in the legal history of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, which it is necessary to notice, and to which I propose to adduce another of those awkward precedents, which I have exhumed from those musty old records, which our Northern brethren seem so thoroughly to have forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4519"/>It has been charged against the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, that her crew was composed mostly of foreigners, and that this was another reason why she was not entitled to be considered as a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> ship of war. Let us look a little into this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>A sovereign is not only not obliged to account to other nations, for the manner in which he becomes possessed of his ships of war, as we have seen, but he cannot be questioned as to the nativity or naturalization of the persons serving on board of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>It could have been of no sort of consequence to any foreign officer, demanding to see my commission, whether I was a native of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, or of any other foreign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>All that he could demand of me, in order to satisfy himself that I was entitled to exercise belligerent rights, was a sight of my commission as a <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> naval officer</hi>. Nationality is presumed in all such commissions, and the presumption cannot be inquired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/><persName n="Story,Mister-Justice,,,," id="n0133.0030.00396.01043" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister-Justice">Mr. Justice</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName>, in the decision quoted a few pages back, says, as the reader will recollect, that the commission of a ship of war imports such <q direct="unspecified">absolute verity,</q> that it cannot be inquired into, or contradicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>It is like proving a fact by a record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>No other proof than the production of the record is required, or indeed permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/>The commission of the commander is the commission <pb id="p.397" n="397"/> of his ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>Neither the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi> nor the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had any other commission than my own, and the orders assigning me to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>If this be the law with regard to the commander of a ship, <hi rend="italics">a fortiori</hi>, must it be the law with reference to the subordinate officers and crew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>The writers on international law, without exception, lay down the rule, that a sovereign may enlist foreigners to assist him in his wars; and that the men thus enlisted are entitled to all the protection of belligerents, equally with native citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/>The <persName><foreName>Swiss</foreName></persName> foreign legions, so well known in history, are notable illustrations of this doctrine; and no <num value="1">one</num> has ever heard of a Swiss being hung because he served under a foreign flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>Vattel, who has the rare merit of having so thoroughly exhausted all these subjects, that he has left scarcely anything for those who have followed him to say, lays down the doctrine as follows: <q direct="unspecified">Much has been said on the question whether the profession of a mercenary soldier be lawful or not,&mdash;whether individuals may, for money, or any other reward, engage to serve a foreign prince in his wars?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>This question does not appear to me to be very difficult to be solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>Those who enter into such engagements, without the express or tacit consent of their sovereign, offend against their duty as citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>But if their sovereign leaves them at liberty to follow their inclination for a military life, they are perfectly free in that respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>[Modern nations, and especially the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, have left their citizens free to expatriate themselves at pleasure.] Now, every free man may join whatever society he pleases, according as he finds it most to his advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>He may make its cause his own, and espouse its quarrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>He becomes, in some measure, at least for a time, a member of the <rs>State</rs> in whose service he engages.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>Again: <q direct="unspecified">The sovereign has no right to compel foreigners; he must not even employ stratagem or artifice, in order to induce them to engage in a contract, which, like all others, should be founded on candor and good faith.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>With reference to the conduct of the enemy in this particular, I deem it not amiss to introduce a short extract or <num value="2">two</num>, from a speech made by <persName n="Cairnes,Sir,Hugh,,," id="n0133.0030.00398.01045" reg="default:Cairnes,Hugh,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Hugh</foreName> <surname>Cairnes</surname></persName>, her Britannic Majesty's <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, on the <dateStruct value="1864-05-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>The discussion grew out of the case of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> steamer <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName></hi>, which had recently returned to <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, after a cruise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>The case of the <hi rend="italics">Kearsarge</hi> was a case of this character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>Beyond all question, a considerable amount of recruiting was carried on, at <placeName reg="Cork, Cork, Munster" key="tgn,7007168">Cork</placeName>, for the purposes of that ship, she being employed at the time, in our own waters, or very near them, in looking out for the enemy; and she was furnished with a large addition to her crew from <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>The men were afterward relanded, and there can be no doubt that there had been a violation of our neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>Still there was some <hi rend="italics">physique</hi> among these fellows, and soap, and water, and clean shirts would make a wonderful difference in their appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>As night approached, I relieved <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> <pb id="p.406" n="406"/> Butcher of his command, and removing my baggage on board, took possession of the cabin, in which I was to spend so many weary days, and watchful nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/>I am a good sleeper, and slept soundly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>This quality of sleeping well in the intervals of harassing business is a valuable <num value="1">one</num> to the sailor, and I owe to it much of that physical ability, which enabled me to withstand the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of excitement and toil, to which I was subjected during the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> harbors called Angra, in <placeName key="tgn,1009414" n="1.000 10" reg="Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe">Terceira</placeName>&mdash;<placeName reg="East Angra">East Angra</placeName>, and West Angra.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>We were anchored in the latter, and the authorities notified us, the next morning, that we must move round to <placeName reg="East Angra">East Angra</placeName>, that being the port of entry, and the proper place for the anchorage of merchant-ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>We were <hi rend="italics">playing</hi> merchant-ship as yet, but had nothing to do, of course, with ports of entry or custom-houses; and as the day was fine, and there was a prospect of smooth water under the lee of the island, I got under way, and went to sea, the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> and the transport accompanying me. Steaming beyond the marine league, I hauled the transport alongside, and we got on board from her the remainder of our armament, and stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>The sea was not so smooth, as we had expected, and there was some little chafing between the ships, but we accomplished our object, without serious inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>This occupied us all day, and after nightfall, we ran into <placeName reg="East Angra">East Angra</placeName>, and anchored.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>As we passed the fort, we were hailed vociferously, in very bad <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0133.0031.00406.01078" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, or Portuguese, we could not distinguish which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>But though the words were unintelligible to us, the manner and tone of the hail were evidently meant to warn us off. Continuing our course, and paying no attention to the hail, the fort presently fired a shot over us; but we paid no attention to this either, and ran in and anchored&mdash;the bark accompanying us, but the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> hauling off, seaward, and lying off and on during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/>There was a small Portuguese schooner of war at anchor in the harbor, and about midnight, I was aroused from a deep sleep, into which I had fallen, after a long day of work and excitement, by an officer coming below, and informing me, very coolly, that the <name>Portuguese</name> man-of-war was firing into us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/><q direct="unspecified">The d&mdash;l she is,</q> said I; <pb id="p.407" n="407"/> <quote>how many shots has she fired at us?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>I knew very well, that the little craft would not dare to fire <hi rend="italics">into</hi> us, though I thought it probable, that, after the fashion of the <name>Chinese</name>, who sound their gongs to scare away their enemies, she might be firing <hi rend="italics">at</hi> us, to alarm us into going out of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>I said therefore to the officer, <q direct="unspecified">Let him fire away, I expect he won't hurt you,</q> and turned over and went to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>In the morning, it was ascertained, that it was not the schooner at all, that had been firing, but a passing mail steamer which had run into the anchorage, and fired <num value="3">three</num> signal guns, to awaken her sleeping passengers on shore&mdash;with whom she departed before daylight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>We were not further molested, from this time onward, but were permitted to remain and coal from the bark; though the custom-house officers, accompanied by the <rs>British Consul</rs>, paid us a visit, and insisted that we should suspend our operation of coaling, until we had entered the <num value="2">two</num> ships at the custom-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>This I readily consented to do. I now called the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> in, by signal, and she ran in and anchored near us. Whilst the coaling was going forward, the carpenter, and gunner, with the assistance of the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Engineer">chief engineer</rs>, were busy putting down the circles or traverses for the pivot guns; and the boatswain and his gang were at work, fitting side and train tackles for the broadside guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>The reader can understand how anxious I was to complete all these arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>I was perfectly defenseless without them, and did not know at what moment an enemy's ship might look in upon me. The harbor of <placeName reg="East Angra">East Angra</placeName>, where we were now anchored, was quite open, but fortunately for us, the wind was light, and from the S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>To cast an eye, for a moment, now, from the ship to the shore, I was charmed with the appearance of <placeName key="tgn,1009414" n="1.000 10" reg="Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe">Terceira</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4660"/>Every square foot of the island seemed to be under the most elaborate cultivation, and snug farm-houses were dotted so thickly over the hill-sides, as to give the whole the appearance of a rambling village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4661"/>The markets were most bountifully supplied <pb id="p.408" n="408"/> with excellent beef and mutton, and the various domestic fowls, fish, vegetables, and fruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/>My steward brought off every morning in his basket, a most tempting assortment of the latter; for there were apples, plums, pears, figs, dates, oranges, and melons all in full bearing at <placeName key="tgn,1009414" n="1.000 10" reg="Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe">Terceira</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>The little town of <placeName reg="Angra do Heroismo,Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe" key="tgn,1049694">Angra</placeName>, abreast of which we were anchored, was a perfect picture of a Portuguese-Moorish town, with its red-tiled roofs, sharp gables, and parti-colored verandas, and veranda curtains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>And then the quiet, and love-in-a-cottage air which hovered over the whole scene, so far removed from the highways of the world's commerce, and the world's alarms, was charming to contemplate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>I had arrived on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, we had, by the dint of great labor and perseverance, drawn order out of chaos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>We only awaited the following morning to steam out upon the high seas, and formally put the ship in commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>Saturday had been dark and rainy, but we had still labored on through the rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> dawned bright and beautiful, which we hailed as a harbinger of future success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>All hands were turned out at early daylight, and the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">first lieutenant</rs>, and the officer of the deck took the ship in hand, to prepare her for the coming ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>She was covered with coal dust and dirt and rubbish in every direction, for we had hitherto had no time to attend to appearances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>But by dint of a few hours of scrubbing, inside and out, and of the use of that wellknown domestic implement, the holy-stone, that works so many wonders with a dirty ship, she became sweet and clean, and when her awnings were snugly spread, her yards squared, and her rigging hauled taut, she looked like a bride, with the orange-wreath about her brows, ready to be led to the altar.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>I had as yet no enlisted crew, and this thought gave me some anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>All the men on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, as well as those who had come out with me, on board the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi>, had been brought thus far, under articles of agreement that were to be no longer obligatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>Some of them had been shipped for <num value="1">one</num> voyage, and some for another, but none of them for service <pb id="p.409" n="409"/> on board a Confederate cruiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>This was done to avoid a breach of the <rs>British Foreign Enlistment Act</rs>. They had, of course, been undeceived from the day of our departure from <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/><hi rend="italics">They</hi> knew that they were to be released from the contracts they had made, but <hi rend="italics">I</hi> could not know how many of them would engage with me for the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. It is true I had had a talk with some of the leaders of the crew, who had promised to go with me, and to influence others, but no creature can be more whimsical than a sailor, until you have bound him past recall, unless indeed it be a woman.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>The ship having been properly prepared, we steamed out, on this bright <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, under a cloudless sky, with a gentle breeze from the southeast, scarcely ruffling the surface of the placid sea, and under the shadow of the smiling and picturesque island of <placeName key="tgn,1009414" n="1.000 10" reg="Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe">Terceira</placeName>, which nature seemed to have decked specially for the occasion, so charming did it appear, in its checkered dress of a lighter and darker green, composed of corn-fields and orange-groves, the flag of the new-born <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was unfurled, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, from the peak of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. The <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> accompanied us. The ceremony was short but impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>The officers were all in full uniform, and the crew neatly dressed, and I caused <q direct="unspecified">all hands</q> to be summoned aft on the quarter-deck, and mounting a guncarriage, I read the commission of <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0031.00409.01079" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, appointing me a captain in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Navy, and the order of <persName n="Mallory,Mister,Stephen,R.,," id="n0133.0031.00409.01080" reg="default:Mallory,Stephen,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Stephen</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, directing me to assume command of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. Following my example, the officers and crew had all uncovered their heads, in deference to the sovereign authority, as is customary on such occasions; and as they stood in respectful silence and listened with rapt attention to the reading, and to the short explanation of my object and purposes, in putting the ship in commission which followed, I was deeply impressed with the spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, the grand old mother of many of the <name>States</name>, who afterward died so nobly; <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, were all represented in the persons of my officers, and I had some of as fine specimens of the daring and adventurous seaman, as any ship of war could boast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>While the reading was going on, <num value="2">two</num> small balls might <pb id="p.410" n="410"/> have been seen ascending slowly, <num value="1">one</num> to the peak, and the other to the main-royal mast-head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>These were the ensign and pennant of the future man-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>These balls were so arranged, that by a sudden jerk of the halliards by which they had been sent aloft, the flag and pennant would unfold themselves to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>A curious observer would also have seen a quartermaster standing by the <rs>English</rs> colors, which we were still wearing, in readiness to strike them, a band of music on the quarter-deck, and a gunner (lock-string in hand) standing by the weather-bow gun. All these men had their eyes upon the reader; and when he had concluded, at a wave of his hand, the gun was fired, the change of flags took place, and the air was rent by a deafening cheer from officers and men; the band, at the same time, playing <q direct="unspecified">Dixie,</q>&mdash; that soul-stirring national anthem of the new-born government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>The <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> also fired a gun and cheered the new flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>Thus, amid this peaceful scene of beauty, with all nature smiling upon the ceremony, was the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> christened; the name <q direct="unspecified"><num value="290">290</num></q> disappearing with the <rs>English</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>This had all been done upon the high seas, more than a marine league from the land, where <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0031.00410.01081" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> had as much jurisdiction as <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,Abraham,,," id="n0133.0031.00410.01082" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>Who could look into the horoscope of this ship&mdash;who anticipate her career?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>From the cradle to the grave there is but a step; and that I may group in a single picture, the christening and the burial of the ship, let the reader imagine, now, some <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> to have rolled over&mdash;and such a <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of carnage and blood, as the world had never before seen&mdash;and, strangely enough, another <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, equally bright and beautiful, to have dawned upon the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>Many of the manly figures who had stood with uncovered heads, and listened with respectful silence to the christening, went down in the ship, and now lie buried with her, many fathoms deep, with no other funeral dirge than the roar of cannon, and the howling winds of the <rs type="place">North Sea</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>Such were the birth and death of the ship, whose adventures I propose to sketch in the following pages.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>My speech, I was glad to find, had produced considerable effect with the crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>I informed them, in the opening, that they were all released from the contracts under which they had come thus far, and that such of them as preferred to return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> could do so in the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi>, without prejudice to their interests, as they would have a free passage back, and their pay would go on until they were discharged in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>I then gave them a brief account of the war, and told them how the <rs>Southern States</rs>, being sovereign and independent, had dissolved the league which had bound them to the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and how they were threatened with subjugation by their late confederates, who were the stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>They would be fighting, I told them, the battles of the oppressed against the oppressor, and this consideration alone should be enough to nerve the arm of every generous sailor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>Coming nearer home, for it could not be supposed that <name>English</name>, <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Dutch</placeName>, <name>Irish</name>, <name>French</name>, <persName n="Italian,,,,," id="n0133.0031.00411.01083" reg="mostcommon:Italian,nomatch:0"><surname>Italian</surname></persName>, and Spanish sailors could understand much about the rights or wrongs of nations, I explained to them the individual advantages which they might expect to reap from an enlistment with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>We had a fine ship under us; <num value="1">one</num> that they might fall in love with, as they would with their sweethearts <pb id="p.412" n="412"/> about Wapping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>We should visit many parts of the world, where they would have <q direct="unspecified">liberty</q> given them on proper occasions; and we should, no doubt, destroy a great many of the enemy's ships, in spite of the enemy's cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>With regard to these last, though fighting was not to be our principal object, yet, if a favorable opportunity should offer of our laying ourselves alongside of a ship that was not too heavy for us, they would find me disposed to indulge them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>Finally I came to the finances, and like a skilful <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, I put the budget to them, in its very best aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>came up from several voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/>Democracies may do very well for the land, but monarchies and pretty absolute monarchies at that, are the only successful governments for the sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4765"/>My <q direct="unspecified">steerage officers,</q> who are too numerous to be named individually, were a capital set of young men, as were the <q direct="unspecified">forward officers.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/>Indeed, with the exception of the black sheep in the ward-room, with Federal propensities, to whom I have alluded, I had reason to be satisfied with my officers of all grades.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>I must not forget to introduce to the reader <num value="1">one</num> humble <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> individual of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>'s</hi> crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4768"/>He was my steward, and my household would not be complete without him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>He was an obedient, respectful, and attentive major-domo, but, unfortunately, was rather too much addicted to the use of the wine which he set on the table, every day, for the guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>Poor Bartelli&mdash;I thus designate him, because of his subsequent sad fate, which the reader will learn in due time&mdash;did not seem to have the power of self-restraint, especially under the treatment he received, which was not gentle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>The captain was rough toward him, and the poor fellow seemed very much cowed and humbled, trembling when spoken to harshly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>His very forlornness drew me toward him. He was an Italian, evidently of gentle blood, and as, with the <name>Italians</name>, drinking to intoxication is not an ineradicable vice, I felt confident that he could be reformed under proper treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4773"/>And so, when we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,1009414" n="1.000 10" reg="Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe">Terceira</placeName>, I asked Bartelli how he would like to go with me, as steward, on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4774"/><q direct="unspecified">There is <num value="1">one</num> understanding, however,</q> I said to him, <q direct="unspecified">which you and I must have: you must never touch a drop of liquor, on board the ship, on duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4778"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> of the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> had no objection, and Bartelli was duly installed as my steward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4779"/>I found him, as I had expected, a capital servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4780"/>He was faithful, and became attached to me, and kept his promise, under strong temptation; for there was always in the cabin-lockers of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> the best of wines and other liquors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4781"/>He took care of my linen like a woman, washing it himself when we were at sea, and sending it to some careful laundress when in port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4782"/>I shall, perhaps, astonish a great many husbands and heads of families, when I tell them, that every shirt-button was always in its place, and that I never had to call for needle and thread under difficulties!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4783"/>My mess affairs never gave me the least trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4784"/>My table <pb id="p.419" n="419"/> was always well supplied, and when guests were expected, I could safely leave the arrangements to Bartelli; and then it was a pleasure to observe the air, and grace of manner and speech, with which he would receive my visitors and conduct them into the cabin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4785"/>Poor Bartelli!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4786"/>The day after the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Bahama</rs></hi> left us was cloudy, and cheerless in aspect, with a fresh wind and a rough sea. The ship was rolling and tumbling about, to the discomfort of every <num value="1">one</num>, and confusion still reigned on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4787"/>Below decks everything was dirt and disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>Nobody had as yet been berthed or messed, nor had any <num value="1">one</num> been stationed at a gun or a rope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4789"/>Spare shot-boxes and other heavy articles were fetching way, and the ship was leaking considerably through her upper works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>She had been put together with rather green timber, and, having been caulked in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, in winter, her seams were beginning to gape beneath the ardent heats of a semi-tropical climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>I needed several days yet, to put things <q direct="unspecified">to rights,</q> and mould the crew into a little shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>I withdrew, therefore, under easy sail, from the beaten tracks of commerce; and my first lieutenant went to work berthing, and messing, and quartering, and stationing his men. The gun-equipments were completed, and such little alterations made as were found necessary for the easy and efficient working of the battery, and the guns were sealed with blank cartridges, and put in a proper condition for being loaded promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4793"/>We now devoted several days to the exercise of the crew, as well at general, as division, quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>Some few of the guns' crews had served in ships of war before, and proved capital drill-sergeants for the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>The consequence was, that rapid progress was made, and the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was soon in a condition to plume her wings for her flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>It only remained to caulk our upper works, and this occupied us but a day or <num value="2">two</num> longer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>I was much gratified to find that my new ship proved to be a fine sailer, under canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>This quality was of inestimable advantage to me, as it enabled me to do most of my work under sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>She carried but an <measure n="18days" type="date">eighteen days</measure> supply of fuel, and if I had been obliged, because of her dull sailing qualities, to chase every thing under steam, the reader can see how I should have been hampered in my movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>I should have <pb id="p.420" n="420"/> been half my time running into port for fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>This would have disclosed my whereabouts so frequently to the enemy, that I should have been constantly in danger of capture, whereas I could now stretch into the most distant seas, and chase, capture, and destroy, perfectly independent of steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4802"/>I adopted the plan, therefore, of working under sail, in the very beginning of my cruise, and practised it unto the end. With the exception of half a dozen prizes, all my captures were made with my screw hoisted, and my ship under sail; and with but <num value="1">one</num> exception, as the reader will see hereafter, I never had occasion to use steam to escape from an enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4803"/>This keeping of the sea, for <num value="3">three</num>, and <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> at a time, had another great advantage&mdash;it enabled me to keep my crew under better drill, and discipline, and, in every way, better in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>Nothing demoralizes a crew so much as frequent visits to port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>The sailor is as improvident, and incapable of self-government as a child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4806"/>Indeed he is regarded by most nations as a ward of the state, and that sort of legislation is thrown around him, which is thrown around a ward in chancery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4807"/>The moment a ship drops her anchor in a port, like the imprisoned bird, he begins to beat the bars of his cage, if he is not permitted to go on shore, and have his frolic; and when on shore, to carry our simile still further, he is like the bird let out of the cage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>He gives a loose rein to his passions, and sometimes plunges so deeply into debauchery, that he renders himself unfit for duty, for days, and sometimes weeks, after he is hunted up and brought on board by the police, which is most frequently the manner in which his captain again gets possession of him. Such is the reckless intemperance into which some of the regular old salts plunge, that I have known them to go on shore, make their way straight to a sailor-boarding-house, which is frequently a dance-house, and always a grog-shop, give what money they have about them to the <q direct="unspecified">landlord,</q> and tell him to keep them drunk as long as it will last, and when they have had the worth of it in a <hi rend="italics">good, long, big</hi> drunk, to pick them up, and send them off to their ship!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4809"/>The very d&mdash;l is to pay, too, when a lot of drunken sailors is brought on board, as every first lieutenant knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4810"/>Frequently they have to be knocked down, disarmed <pb id="p.421" n="421"/> of the dangerous sheath-knives which they wear, and confined in irons until they are sober.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4811"/>When that takes place, <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0032.00421.01116" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> comes out of the <q direct="unspecified">Brig,</q> his place of confinement, very much ashamed of himself; generally with a blackened eye or <num value="2">two</num>, if not with a broken nose, and looking very seedy in the way of apparel, as the chances are that he has sold or exchanged the tidy suit in which he went on shore, for some long-shore toggery, the better to enable him to prolong that delightful drunk of his. It was quite enough to have such scenes as these repeated once in <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4812"/>When I had put my ship in a tolerable state of defence, and given a little practice at the guns, to my crew, I turned her head toward her cruising ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>It so happened that this was not very far off. Following <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0133.0032.00421.01117" reg="mostcommon:Porter,David,,,:1"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s example in the <rs>Pacific</rs>,&mdash;I mean the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0133.0032.00421.01118" reg="mostcommon:Porter,David,,,:1"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>, the father of the present <rs>Admiral</rs> in the <rs>Federal Navy</rs>,&mdash;I resolved to strike a blow at the enemy's whale-fishery, off the <rs>Azores</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>There is a curious and beautiful problem&mdash;that of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> feeding the whale &mdash;connected with this fishery, which I doubt not will interest the reader, as it did the writer of these pages, when it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came under his notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4815"/>It is because of that problem, that the <rs>Azores</rs> are a whaling station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>The food which attracts the whale to these islands is not produced in their vicinity, but is carried thither by the currents&mdash;the currents of the ocean performing the same functions for the finny tribe, that the atmosphere does for the plants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4817"/>The fishes of the sea, in their kingdom beneath the waters, have thus their highways and byways, as well as the animals upon the land, and are always to be found congregated where their great food-bearers, the currents, make their deposits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4818"/>Animalculae, infusoria, small fishes, minute crustacea, and shell-fish found on the algae, or floating sea-weed, sea-nettles, and other food, are produced in the more calm latitudes, where the waters are comparatively still, taken up by the currents, and transported to the more congenial feeding-grounds of the whales, and other fishes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>Much of this food is produced in the tepid waters of the sea, into which, it is well known, some descriptions of whales cannot <pb id="p.422" n="422"/> enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>The equatorial belt of waters surrounding the earth, between the tropics, whose temperature is generally <num value="80">80</num>&deg; of Fahrenheit, is as a sea of fire to the <q direct="unspecified">right</q> whale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4821"/>It would be as certain death for this species of whale to attempt to cross these waters, as for a human being to plunge into a burning lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4822"/>The proof of this is that the <q direct="unspecified">right</q> whale of the northern hemisphere is never found in the southern hemisphere, or <hi rend="italics">e converse</hi>. It is a separate and distinct species of fish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4823"/>See how beneficent, therefore, the arrangement is, by which the food for these monsters of the deep is transported from the tepid waters, into which they cannot enter in pursuit of it, to the cooler waters in which they delight to gambol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/>The <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream is the great food-carrier for the extra-tropical whales of the northern hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4825"/>An intelligent sea-captain, writing to <persName n="Maury,Superintendent,,,," id="n0133.0032.00422.01119" reg="nearbymention:Maury,William,Lewis,,"><roleName n="Superintendent">Superintendent</roleName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName> of the <rs>National Observatory</rs>, some years before the war, informed him, that in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, off the coast of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, he fell in with <q direct="unspecified">such a school of young sea-nettles, as had never before been heard of.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4826"/>The sea was literally covered with them for many square leagues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4827"/>He likened them, in appearance, to acorns floating on the water, but they were so thick as completely to cover the sea. He was bound to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and was <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> in sailing through them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4828"/>In about <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> afterward, on his return voyage, he fell in with the same school off the <rs>Azores</rs>, and here he was <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> in passing them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4829"/>He recognized them as the same, for he had never before seen any quite like them; and on both occasions he frequently hauled up buckets full, and examined them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4830"/>In their adventurous voyage of <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, during which they must have been tossed about in several gales of wind, these little marine animals had grown considerably, and already the whales had begun to devour them; for the school was now so much diminished in size, that the captain was enabled to sail through it, in <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, instead of the <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> which it had formerly taken him. We see, thus, that the fishes of the sea have their seed-time and harvest; that the same beneficent hand that decks the lilies of the field in garments more superb than those of <persName><foreName>Solomon</foreName></persName>, and feeds the young raven, seeds down the great equatorial belt of waters for the fishes; and that <pb id="p.423" n="423"/> when the harvest-time has come, he sends in his reapers and gleaners, the currents, which bind up the sheaves, and bear them off <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure>, to those denizens of the great deep, which, perhaps, but for this beautiful and beneficent arrangement, would die of inanition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>The whaling season ends at the <rs>Azores</rs> about the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> winter gales begin to blow, and the food becomes scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/>The whales then migrate to other feeding-grounds, and the adventurous whaler follows them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>As we were now, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, the reader will see, that we had but a few weeks left, in which to accomplish our purpose of striking a blow at the enemy's whale fishery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/>In the afternoon of <dateStruct value="-09-4"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>, the weather being fine and clear, we made <persName n="Pico,,,,," id="n0133.0032.00423.01120" reg="mostcommon:Pico,nomatch:0"><surname>Pico</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,1007070" n="1.000 1" reg="faial,horta,ilhas dos acores,portugal,europe">Fayal</placeName>, and reducing sail to topsails, lay off and on during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4835"/>The next day, the weather being cloudy, and the wind light from the eastward, we made our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prize, without the excitement of a chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>A ship having been discovered, lying to, with her foretopsail to the mast, we made sail for her, hoisting the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, and approached her within boarding distance, that is to say, within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, without her moving tack or sheet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>She had shown the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors in return, as we approached, and proved to be a whaler, with a huge whale, which she had recently struck, made fast alongside, and partially hoisted out of the water by her yard tackles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/>The surprise was perfect and complete, although <measure n="11days" type="date">eleven days</measure> had elapsed since the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had been commissioned at a neighboring island, less than a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>The captured ship proved to be the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 7" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee</placeName></hi>, of <placeName reg="Edgartown, Dukes, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049741">Edgartown, Massachusetts</placeName>, whose master was a genuine specimen of the <rs>Yankee</rs> whaling skipper; long and lean, and as elastic, apparently, as the whalebone he dealt in. Nothing could exceed the blank stare of astonishment, that sat on his face, as the change of flags took place on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. He had been engaged, up to the last moment, with his men, securing the rich spoil alongside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/>The whale was a fine <q direct="unspecified">sperm,</q> and was a <q direct="unspecified">big strike,</q> and had already been denuded of much of its blubber when we got alongside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>He naturally concluded, he said, when he saw the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors at our peak, that <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> we were <num value="1">one</num> of the new gunboats sent out by <persName n="Welles,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0032.00424.01121" reg="mostcommon:Welles,Gideon,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName> to protect the whale fishery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>It was indeed remarkable, that no protection should have been given to these men, by their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>Unlike the ships of commerce, the whalers are obliged to congregate within small well-known spaces of ocean, and remain there for weeks at a time, whilst the whaling season lasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>It was the most obvious thing in the world, that these vessels, thus clustered together, should attract the attention of the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> cruisers, and be struck at. There are not more than half a dozen principal whaling stations on the entire globe, and a ship, of size and force, at each, would have been sufficient protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>But the whalers, like the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> generally, were abandoned to their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/><persName n="Welles,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0032.00424.01122" reg="mostcommon:Welles,Gideon,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName> did not seem capable of learning by experience even; for the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Shenandoah,,,,," id="n0133.0032.00424.01123" reg="mostcommon:Shenandoah,nomatch:0"><surname>Shenandoah</surname></persName></hi> repeated the successes of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, in the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Pacific</placeName>, toward the close of the war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>It took us some time to remove the crew of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 7" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee</placeName></hi>, consisting of <num value="37">thirty-seven</num> persons, to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>With a little management and caution, I might hope to uncover the birds, no faster than I could bag them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>And so, hoisting a light at the peak of the prize, I permitted her to remain anchored to the whale, and we lay by her until the next morning, when we burned her; the smoke of the conflagration being, no doubt, mistaken by vessels at a distance, for that of some passing steamer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>To those curious in such matters, I may state that a large sperm whale will yield <measure n="25barrels" type="mass">twenty-five barrels</measure> of oil from the head alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>The whale, though a very intelligent fish, and with an affection for its <q direct="unspecified">calf,</q> almost human, has but a small brain, the great cavity of its skull being filled as described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>As the specific gravity of oil is considerably less than that of water, we can be at no loss to conjecture why the monster has so bountiful a supply, nor why it is that it carries the supply in its head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>As is well known, the whale is a warm-blooded mammal, as much so as the cow that roams our pastures, and cannot live by breathing the water alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>Instead of the gill arrangement of other fishes, which enables them to extract from the water sufficient air to vitalize the blood, it has the lungs of the mammal, and needs to breathe the atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>The oil in the head, acting on the principle of the cork, enables it to ascend very rapidly, from great depths in the ocean, when it requires to breathe, or <q direct="unspecified">blow.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/>See how beautiful this oil arrangement is, too, in another aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>It enables the monster, when it requires rest, to lay its head on the softest kind of a pillow, an ocean wave, and sleep as unconcernedly as the child does upon the bosom of its mother.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>After speaking this ship, and telling her that we were a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> cruiser, we bore away north, half west, and in a couple of hours made the island of <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0032.00425.01125" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, the westernmost of the <rs>Azores</rs>, and a favorite island to be sighted by the whalers, for the correction of their chronometers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>Approaching it just at nightfall, we shortened sail, and lay off and on during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>This island is an exceedingly picturesque object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>It rises like a huge mountain from the depths of the sea, with the bluest and deepest of water all around it. It is rock-bound, and there is scarcely any part of it, where a ship might not haul alongside of the rocks, and make fast to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>It rises to the height of a <measure n="1000feet" type="distance">thousand feet</measure> and more, and is covered with a luxuriant <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> vegetation, the substratum of rock being overlaid with a generous soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>The climate is genial for <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the year, but almost a perpetual gale howls over it in winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>At a distance, the island appeared like an unbroken mountain, but as we approached it, many beautiful valleys, and gaps in the mountain presented themselves, with the neat white farmhouses of the lonely dwellers peeping out from beneath the dense foliage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>It was indeed a beautiful scene to look upon, and such was the air of perfect repose and peace that pervaded it, that a ship of war seemed out of place, approaching its quiet shores.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>The reader has now been sufficiently long with us to know, that when we speak of <q direct="unspecified">muster</q> on board a ship of war, we do not mean simply the calling of the roll, but a ceremony of dress and inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>With clean, white decks, with the brass and <rs n="iron work" type="product">iron work</rs> glittering like so many mirrors in the sun, and with the sails neatly trimmed, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> flag at our peak, we spread our awnings and read the <rs>Articles</rs> of War to the crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>A great change had taken place in the appearance of the men, since I made that stump speech to them which has been described Their parti-colored garments had been cast aside, and they were all neatly arrayed in duck frocks and trousers, well-polished shoes, and straw hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>There was a visible improvement in their health, too. They had been long enough out of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> to recover from the effects of their debauches, and regain their accustomed stamina.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reading of the <rs>Articles</rs> of War to them, and it was curious to observe the attention with which they listened to the reading, occasionally eying each other, as they were struck by particular portions of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>It is with a disorderly crew, as with other things, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blows are the most effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>I had <num value="2">two</num> motives in thus landing my prisoners in their own boats, or, to speak more properly, in the boats which had once belonged to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>It saved me the trouble of landing them myself; and, as the boats were valuable, and I permitted the prisoners to put in them as many provisions as they desired, and as much other plunder as they could pick up about the decks of their ships &mdash;excepting always such articles as we needed on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>&mdash;the sale of their boats and cargoes to the islanders gave them the means of subsistence, until they could communicate with their consul in the neighboring island of <placeName key="tgn,1007070" n="1.000 1" reg="faial,horta,ilhas dos acores,portugal,europe">Fayal</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>We had scarcely gotten through with the operation of landing our prisoners, before the cry of <q direct="unspecified">sail ho!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>came to us from the mast-head; and we made sail in chase of a schooner which was approaching the island, hoisting the <rs>English</rs> colors to throw the stranger off his guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>As the <num value="2">two</num> vessels were sailing toward each other, they approached very rapidly, and <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> in the course of an hour we were within a mile of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>Still the schooner did not show any colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>The reason was quite plain; she was American in every feature, and could show us no other colors than such as would subject her to capture, in case we should prove to be her enemy, of which she seemed to be suspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>Indeed, the gallant little craft, with every stitch of canvas set, sails well hoisted, and sheets a little eased, was now edging off a little from us, and endeavoring to gain the shelter of the well-known marine league, the land being distant only about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>. Perceiving her object, and seeing that I had only a couple of miles to spare, I kept my own ship off, the better to throw myself across the stranger's path, changed my colors, and fired a blank cartridge to heave her to. But she neither hove to, nor showed colors, being evidently intent upon giving me a race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>Although I already had the little craft under my guns, I humored her for a few minutes, just to show her that I could beat her in a fair trial of speed, and when I had proved this, by gaining rapidly upon her, I sent a round shot from <num value="1">one</num> of the bow guns between her masts, a few feet only over the heads of her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>If the reader has heard a <num value="32">32</num>-pounder whistle, in such close proximity, he knows very well what it says, to wit, that there must be no more trifling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>And so the captain of the schooner understood it, for in a moment afterward we could see the graceful little craft luffing up in the wind, brailing up her foresail, and hauling her jib sheet to windward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>The welcome stars and stripes fluttered soon afterward from her peak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>The master being brought on board with his papers, the prize proved to be the <term type="ship">schooner</term> <rs type="ship">Starlight</rs>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, from <placeName key="tgn,1007070" n="1.000 1" reg="faial,horta,ilhas dos acores,portugal,europe">Fayal</placeName>, bound to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> by the way of <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00429.01129" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, for which island she had some passengers, several ladies among the number.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>The crew consisted of <num value="7">seven</num> persons&mdash;all good <name>Yankee</name> sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>Having heard, by this time, full accounts of the shameful treatment of my paymaster of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, which has been described, in a former chapter, I resolved to practise a little retaliation upon the enemy, and ordered the crew of the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Starlight</rs></hi> put in irons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>I pursued this practice, painful as it was, for the next <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> captures, putting the masters and mates of the ships, as well as the crews, in irons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>The masters would frequently <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> remonstrate with me, claiming that it was an indignity put upon them; and so it was, but I replied to them, that their countrymen had put a similar indignity upon an officer and a gentleman, who had worn the uniform of the navies of both our countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>By the time that the capture of the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Starlight</rs></hi> had been completed, the sun was near his setting, and it was too late to land the passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>I therefore sent a prize crew on board the captured ship, directing the prize-master to lie by me during the night, and giving him especial charge to inform the passengers that they should be safely landed in the morning, and, in the meantime, to quiet the fears of the ladies, who had been much alarmed by the chase and the firing, we hoisted a light at the peak of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and lay to, all night, in nearly a calm sea. There were some dark clouds hanging over the island, but they had apparently gone there to roost, as no wind came from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>Among the papers captured on board the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Starlight</rs></hi> were a couple of despatches from the <rs>Federal Consul</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,1007070" n="1.000 1" reg="faial,horta,ilhas dos acores,portugal,europe">Fayal</placeName>, to the Sewards-father and son &mdash;in which there was the usual amount of stale nonsense about <q direct="unspecified">rebel privateers,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">pirates.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/></p> 
<p>The weather proved fine, the next morning, and standing in, within a stone's throw of the little town of <placeName reg="Santa cruz, Santa Cruz, California" key="tgn,7014479">Santa Cruz</placeName>, we landed both passengers and prisoners, putting the latter, as usual, under <hi rend="italics">parole</hi>. In the meantime, the <rs>Governor</rs> of the island, and a number of the dignitaries came off to visit us. They were a robust, farmer-looking people, giving evidence, in their persons, of the healthfulness of the island, and were very polite, franking to us the ports of the island, and informing us that supplies were cheap, and abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>Their visit was evidently <num value="1">one</num> of curiosity, and we treated his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> with all due ceremony, notwithstanding the smallness of his dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>We talked to him, however, of bullocks, and sheep, fish and turtles, yams and oranges, rather than of the war between the <name>States</name>, and the laws of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>Bartelli made the eyes of the party dance with flowing goblets of champagne, and when I thought they had remained long enough, I bowed them out of the cabin, with a cigar all round, and sent them on shore, with rather favorable impressions, I do not doubt, of the <q direct="unspecified">pirate.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/><pb id="p.431" n="431"/></p> 
<p>Hauling off, now, from the island, and running seaward for a space, we chased and overhauled a Portuguese whaling <persName n="Seeing,Brigadier,,,," id="n0133.0033.00431.01130" reg="mostcommon:Seeing,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier">brig.</roleName> <surname>Seeing</surname></persName> by her boats and other indications that she was a whaler, I thought, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that I had a prize, and was quite disappointed when she showed me the <name>Portuguese</name> colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>Not being willing to trust to the verity of the flag, I sent a boat on board of her, and invited the master to visit me with his papers, which he did. The master was himself a Portuguese, and I found his papers to be genuine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>Thanking him for his visit, I dismissed him in a very few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>I had no right to command him to come on board of me&mdash;he being a neutral, it was my business to go on board of him, if I desired to examine his papers, but he waived ceremony, and it was for this that I had thanked him. I may as well remark here, in passing, that this was the only foreign whaling-ship that I ever overhauled; the business of whaling having become almost exclusively an American monopoly&mdash;the monopoly not being derived from any sovereign grant, but resulting from the superior skill, energy, industry, courage, and perseverance of the <rs>Yankee</rs> whaler, who is, perhaps, the best specimen of a sailor, the world over.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>Later in the same afternoon, we chased a large ship, looming up almost like a frigate, in the northwest, with which we came up about sunset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>We had showed her the <rs>American</rs> colors, and she approached us without the least suspicion that she was running into the arms of an enemy; the master crediting good old <persName n="Welles,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0033.00431.01131" reg="mostcommon:Welles,Gideon,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName>, as the master of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 7" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee</placeName></hi> had done, with sending a flashy-looking <name>Yankee</name> gunboat, to look out for his whalebone and oil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>She had been out <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> and <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, cruising in various parts of the world, had sent home <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> cargoes of oil, and was now returning, herself, with another cargo, of <measure n="1100barrels" type="mass">eleven hundred barrels</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>The consequence was, as the reader has seen, a little disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/><pb id="p.432" n="432"/> I really felt for the honest fellow, but when I came to reflect, for a moment, upon the diabolical acts of his countrymen of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, who were out-heroding <persName n="Herod,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00432.01132" reg="mostcommon:Herod,nomatch:0"><surname>Herod</surname></persName>, in carrying on against us a vindictive war, filled with hate and vengeance, the milk of human kindness which had begun to well up in my heart disappeared, and I had no longer any spare sympathies to dispose of.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>It being near night when the capture was made, I directed the prize to be hove to, in charge of a prize crew until morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>In the meantime, however, the master, who had heard from some of my men, that I had permitted the master of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,1128000" n="1.000 7" reg="ocmulgee, georgia, united states">Ocmulgee</placeName></hi>, and his crew, to land in their own boats, came to me, and requested permission to land in the same manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>We were <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from the land, and I suggested to him, that it was some distance to pull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>Seeing that the sea was smooth, and that there was really no risk to be run, for a Yankee whale-boat might be made, with a little management, to ride out an ordinary gale of wind, I consented, and the delighted master returned to his ship, to make the necessary preparations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>I gave him the usual permission to take what provisions he needed, the whaling gear belonging to his boats, and the personal effects of himself and men. He worked like a beaver, for not more than a couple of hours had elapsed, before he was again alongside of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, with all his <num value="6">six</num> boats, with <num value="6">six</num> men in each, ready to start for the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>I could not but be amused when I looked over the side into these boats, at the amount of plunder that the rapacious fellow had packed in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>They were literally loaded down, with all sorts of traps, from the seamen's chests and bedding, to the tabby cat and parrot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>Nor had the <q direct="unspecified">main chance</q> been overlooked, for all the <q direct="unspecified">cabin stores</q> had been secured, and sundry barrels of beef and pork, besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>I said to him, <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, your boats appear to me, to be rather deeply laden; are you not afraid to trust them?</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>The boats, shoving off from the side, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, and falling into line, struck out for the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>That night-landing of this whaler's crew was a beautiful spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>I stood on the horseblock, watching it, my mind busy with many thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>The moon was shining brightly, though there were some passing clouds sailing lazily in the upper air, that fleckered the sea. <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00433.01133" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, which was sending off to us, even at this distance, her perfumes of shrub and flower, lay sleeping in the moonlight, with a few fleecy, white clouds wound around the mountaintop, like a turban.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>The rocky islets that rise like so many shafts out of the sea, devoid of all vegetation, and at different distances from the shore, looked weird and unearthly, like sheeted ghosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>The boats moving swiftly and mysteriously toward the shore, might have been mistaken, when they had gotten a little distance from us, for <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 10" reg="Venezia,Venezia,Veneto,Italia,Europe">Venetian</placeName> gondolas, with their peaked bows and sterns, especially when we heard coming over the sea, a song, sung by a powerful and musical voice, and chorussed by all the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>Those merry fellows were thus making light of misfortune, and proving that the sailor, after all, is the true philosopher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>The echo of that night-song lingered long in my memory, but I little dreamed, as I stood on the deck of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and witnessed the scene I have described, that <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> afterward, it would be quoted against me as a violation of the laws of war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>And yet so it was. It was alleged by the malice of my defamers, who never have, and never can forgive me for the destruction of their property, that miles away at sea, in rough and inclement weather, I <hi rend="italics">compelled</hi> my prisoners to depart for the shore, in leaky and unsound boats, at the hazard of their lives, designing and desiring to drown them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>And this was all the thanks I received for setting some of these fellows up as nabobs, among the islanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>Why, the master of the <hi rend="italics">Ocean Rover</hi>, with his <num value="6">six</num> boats, and their cargoes, was richer than the <rs>Governor</rs>, when he landed in <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00433.01134" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>; where the simple islanders are content with a few head of cattle, a cast-net, and a canoe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had now <num value="2">two</num> prizes in company, with which she lay off and on the island during the night, and she was <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> destined to secure another before morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>I had turned in, and was sleeping soundly, when about midnight, an officer came below to inform me that there was another large ship close on board of us. I was dressed and on deck in a few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>The stranger was plainly visible, being not more than a mile distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>She was heading for the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>I wore ship, as quietly as possible, and followed her, but she had, in the meantime, drawn some distance ahead, and an exciting chase now ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>We were both close-hauled, on the starboard tack, and the stranger, seeing that he was pursued, put every rag of sail on his ship that he could spread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>I could but admire her, with her square yards and white canvas, every sheet home, and every leach taut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half hour, it was hard to tell which ship had the heels of the other, but at the end of that time, we began to head-reach the chase very perceptibly, though the latter rather <q direct="unspecified">eat us out of the wind,</q> or, to speak more conformably with the vocabulary of the land, went to windward of us. This did not matter much, however, as when we should be abreast of her, we would be near enough to reach her with a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>After a chase of about <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, day broke, when we hoisted the <rs>English</rs> ensign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>This was a polite invitation to the chase, to show her colors, but she declined to do so. We now felt sure that she was an enemy, and a prize, and as we were still gaining on her, it was only a matter of an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, when she would fall into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>Our polite invitation to the chase, to show her colors, not succeeding, we became a little more emphatic, and fired a blank cartridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>Still she was obstinate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>She was steering for <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00434.01135" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, and probably, like the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Starlight</rs></hi>, had her eye on the marine league.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>Having approached her, in another half hour, within good round-shot range, I resolved to treat her as I had treated the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Starlight</rs></hi>, and threw a <num value="32">32</num>-pounder near enough to her stern to give the captain a shower-bath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/><rs n="shower baths" type="product">Shower-baths</rs> are very efficacious, in many cases, and we found it so in this, for in a moment more, we could see the stars and stripes ascending to the stranger's peak, and that he had started his tacks and sheets, and was in the act of hauling up his courses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>This done, the main-yard was swung aback, and the prize had surrendered herself a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/><pb id="p.435" n="435"/></p> 
<p>Bartelli now came to tell me, that my bath was ready, and descending to the cabin, I bathed, and dressed for breakfast, whilst the boarding-officer was boarding the prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>She proved to be the <hi rend="italics">Alert, of</hi>, and from New London, and bound, by the way of the <rs>Azores</rs>, and <placeName reg="Cape de Verde">Cape de Verde</placeName> Islands, to the <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>She was only <measure n="16days" type="date">sixteen days</measure> from port, with files of late newspapers; and besides her own ample outfit for a large crew, and a long voyage, she had on board supplies for the group known as the <rs type="place">Navigators' Islands</rs>, in the <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682"><rs type="direction">South</rs> Indian Ocean</placeName>, where among icebergs and storms, the <rs>Yankees</rs> had a whaling and sealing station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>This capture proved to be a very opportune <num value="1">one</num>, as we were in want of just such a lot of clothing, for the men, as we found on board the prize; and the choice beef, and pork, nicely put up ship-bread, boxes of soap, and tobacco, and numerous other articles of seaman's supplies did not come amiss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>We had been particularly short of a supply of tobacco, this being a costly article in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and I could see <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00435.01136" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>'s eye brighten, as he rolled aft, and piled up on the quarter-deck, sundry heavy oaken boxes of good <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> twist.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>That night the pipes seemed to have wonderfully increased in number, on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and the song and the jest derived new inspiration from the fragrance of the weed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>We paroled the officers and crew of the <hi rend="italics">Alert</hi>, and sent them ashore, in their own boats, as we had done the others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>I had now <num value="3">three</num> prizes on my hands, viz.: the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Starlight</rs></hi>, the <hi rend="italics">Ocean Rover</hi>, and the <hi rend="italics">Alert</hi>, with a prize crew on board of each, and as I could make no better use of them than to destroy them, thanks to the unfriendly conduct of neutrals, so often referred to, it became necessary to think of burning them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>They were lying at distances, ranging from half a mile to <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and were fired within a short time of each other, so that we had <num value="3">three</num> funeral pyres burning around us at the same moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>The other whalers at a distance must have thought that there were a good many steamers passing <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00435.01137" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, that day. It was still early in the afternoon, and there was more work before us ere night set in. I had scarcely gotten my prize crews on board, and my boats run up, before another sail was discovered standing in for the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>We immediately gave chase, or rather, to speak more correctly, <pb id="p.436" n="436"/> proceeded to meet the stranger, who was standing in our direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>The ships approached each other very rapidly, and we soon discovered the new sail to be a large schooner, of unmistakable Yankee build and rig. We hoisted the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, and she responded soon afterward with the stars and stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>She came on quite unsuspiciously, as the <num value="2">two</num> last prizes had done, until she arrived near enough to see that the <num value="3">three</num> mysterious cones of smoke, at which she had probably been wondering for some time past, proceeded from <num value="3">three</num> ships on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>Coupling this unusual spectacle with the approach toward her of a rakish-looking barkentine, she at once smelt rather a large rat, and wheeled suddenly in flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>But it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>We were already within <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> of her, and a pursuit of half an hour brought her within effective range of our bow-chaser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>We now changed colors, and fired a blank cartridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>This was sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>She saved us the expenditure of a shot, and hove to, without further ado. Upon being boarded, she proved to be the <hi rend="italics">Weathergauge</hi>, a whaler of <placeName reg="Provincetown, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015018">Provincetown, Massachusetts</placeName>, <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> from the land of the <rs>Puritan</rs>, with other files of newspapers, though not so late as those captured on board the <hi rend="italics">Alert</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>In running over these files, it was wonderful to observe the glibness with which these <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> brethren of ours now talked of treason, and of rebels, and traitors, at no greater distance, in point of time, than <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure>, from the <orgName n="Hartford Convention" type="convention">Hartford Convention</orgName>; to say nothing of certain little idiosyncrasies of theirs, that were developed during the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>There were some <q direct="unspecified"><dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct></q> papers among the rest, and all the pious parsons and deacons in the land were overflowing with patriotism, and hurling death and damnation from their pulpits, against those who had dared to strike at the <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Lord</rs>'s anointed,</q> the sainted <rs>Abraham Lincoln</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>But as the papers contained little or no war news, we had no time to bestow upon the crotchets of the <rs>Yankee</rs> brain, and they were promptly consigned to the waste-paper basket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>Another sail being discovered, whilst we were receiving the surrender of the <hi rend="italics">Weathergauge</hi>, we hastily threw a prize crew on board this latter vessel, directing the prize-master to <q direct="unspecified">hold on to the island of Corvo,</q> during the ensuing night, which was now falling, until we <pb id="p.437" n="437"/> should return, and started off in pursuit of the newly discovered sail.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>Chasing a sail is very much like pursuing a coy maiden, the very coyness sharpening the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>The chase, in the present instance, seemed determined to run away from us; and as she was fast, and we were as determined to overhaul her as she was to run away, she led us a beautiful night-dance over the merry waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>The moon rose bright, soon after the chase commenced, and, striking upon the canvas of the fleeing vessel, lighted it up as though it had been a snow-bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>The <name n="United States">American</name> vessels are distinguished, above all others, for the whiteness of their canvas; being clothed, for the most part, in the fibre of our cotton-fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>The cut of the sails, and the taper of the spars of the chase looked American, and then the ship was cracking on every stitch of canvas that would draw, in the effort to escape&mdash;she must surely be American, we thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>And so we <q direct="unspecified">looked on her, to lust after her,</q> and gave our little ship the benefit of all our skill in seamanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>The speed of the <num value="2">two</num> ships was so nearly matched, that, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hour or <num value="2">two</num>, it was impossible to say whether we had gained on her an inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>We were both running dead before the wind, and this was not the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>'s</hi> most favorable sailing-point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>With her tall lower masts, and large fore-and-aft sails, she was better on a wind, or with the wind abeam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>The chase was leading us away from our cruising-ground, and I should have abandoned it, if I had not had my pride of ship a little interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>It would never do for the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> to be beaten in the beginning of her cruise, and that, too, by a merchantman; and so we threw out all our <q direct="unspecified">light kites</q> to the wind, and gave her the studding-sails <q direct="unspecified">alow and aloft.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>To make a long story short, we chased this ship nearly all night, and only came up with her a little before dawn; and when we did come up with her, she proved to be a Dane!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>She was the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Overman</rs>, from Bankok, in <placeName reg="Siam, Seneca, Ohio" key="tgn,2662003">Siam</placeName>, bound to <placeName reg="Hamburg, Aiken, South Carolina" key="tgn,2095935">Hamburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>There had been no occasion, whatever, for this neutral ship to flee, and the long chase which she had given me was evidently the result of a little spleen; and so, to revenge myself, in a goodnatured way, I insisted upon all my belligerent rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>Though satisfied from her reply to my hail, that she was what she proclaimed <pb id="p.438" n="438"/> herself to be, I compelled her to heave to, which involved the necessity of taking in all that beautiful white canvas, with which she had decoyed me so many miles away from my cruising-ground, and sent a boat on board of her to examine her papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>She thus lost more time than if she had shortened sail earlier in the chase, to permit me to come up with her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>It was late next day before I rejoined the <hi rend="italics">Weathergauge</hi> off Corvo, and I felt, as I was retracing my steps, pretty much as Music or <placeName key="tgn,2101344" n="1.000 5" reg="rover, bedford, tennessee">Rover</placeName> may be supposed to feel, as he is limping back to his kennel, after a run in pursuit of a fox that has escaped him. Bartelli failed to call me at the usual hour, that morning, and I need not say that I made a late breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>We now landed the crew of the <hi rend="italics">Weathergauge</hi>, in their own boats, with the usual store of provisions, and traps, and burned her. <measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> elapsed now without a capture, during which we overhauled but <num value="1">one</num> ship, a Portuguese bark homeward bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>Having beaten the <q direct="unspecified">cover</q> of which <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00438.01138" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName> was the centre, pretty effectually, I now stretched away to the north-west, and ran the island out of sight, intending to skirt it, at the distance of <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>. On the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="2">third</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time>, the welcome cry of <q direct="unspecified">sail ho!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>again rang from the masthead, and making sail in the direction indicated by the look-out, we soon discovered that the chase was a whaler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>Resorting to the usual <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi> of the enemy's flag, the stranger did not attempt to escape, and in an hour or <num value="2">two</num> more, we were alongside of the <rs>American</rs> whaling <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Altamaha,Brigadier,,,," id="n0133.0033.00438.01139" reg="mostcommon:Altamaha,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier">brig</roleName> <surname>Altamaha</surname></persName></hi>, from New Bedford, <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>She did not make so beautiful a bonfire, therefore, as the other whalers had done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>In the afternoon, we overhauled a Spanish ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>Our position, to-day, was latitude <num value="40">40</num>&deg; <num value="34">34</num>&prime; N., and longitude <num value="35">35</num>&deg; <num value="24">24</num>&prime; <num value="15">15</num>&Prime; W. The barometer stood at <measure n="30.3inches" type="distance">30.3 inches</measure>, and the thermometer at <num value="75">75</num>&deg;; from which the reader will see that the weather was fine and pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/>It was now the middle of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, however, and a change might be looked for at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>On the night after capturing the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Altamaha,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00438.01141" reg="mostcommon:Altamaha,nomatch:0"><surname>Altamaha</surname></persName></hi>, we had another night-chase, with more success, however, than the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5008"/>It was my habit, when there was no <q direct="unspecified">game up,</q> to turn in <pb id="p.439" n="439"/> early, usually at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, to enable my <hi rend="italics">physique</hi> to withstand the frequent drafts upon its energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>I was already in a sound sleep, when about <time value="11:30">half-past 11</time>, an old quartermaster came below, and giving my cot a gentle shake, said: <q direct="unspecified">There has a large ship just passed to windward of us, on the opposite tack, sir.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5010"/>I sprang out of bed at once, and throwing on a few clothes, was on deck almost as soon as the quartermaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5011"/>I immediately wore ship, and gave chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5012"/>My ship was under topsails, and it took us some little time to make sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5013"/>By this time the chase was from <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> to <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles distant</measure>, but quite visible to the naked eye, in the bright moonlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>We were both close-hauled on the starboard tack, the chase about <num value="3">three</num> points on the weather bow. The stranger, who was probably keeping a better look-out than is usual with merchant-ships, in consequence of the war, had discovered our movement, and knew he was pursued, as we could see him setting his royals and flying jib, which had been furled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was now at her best point of sailing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>The sailors used to say, when we drew aft the sheets of those immense trysails of hers, and got the fore-tack close aboard, that she was putting on her <num value="7">seven</num>-league boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5017"/>She did, indeed, then seem <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/></p><l>To walk the waters like a thing of life,</l></quote> and there were few sailing ships that could run away from her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5019"/>We gained from the start upon the chase, and in a couple of hours, were on his weather-quarter, having both headreached, and gone to windward of him. He was now no more than about a mile distant, and I fired the accustomed blank cartridge to heave him to. The sound of the gun broke upon the stillness of the night, with startling effect, but the chase did not stir tack or sheet in obedience to it. She was evidently resolved to try conclusions with me a little farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>Finding that I had the advantage of him, on a wind, he kept off a little, and eased his sheets, and we could see, with our nightglasses, that he was rigging out his studding-sail booms preparatory to setting the sails upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/>We kept off in turn, bringing the wind a little forward of the beam, and such good use did the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> make of her <num value="7">seven</num>-league boots, that <pb id="p.440" n="440"/> before the stranger could get even his foretopmast studdingsail set, we had him within good point-blank range of a <num value="32">32</num>-pounder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>The moon was shining very poetically, and the chase was very pretty, but it was rather <q direct="unspecified">after hours,</q> and so I I resolved to shift the scenes, cut short the drama an act or <num value="2">two</num>, and bring it to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5023"/>I now fired a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> gun, though still unshotted, and the smoke had hardly blown away before we could see the stranger hauling up his courses, and bringing his ship to the wind, as much as to say, <q direct="unspecified">I see you have the heels of me, and there is no use in trying any longer.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5024"/>I gave the boarding-officer orders, in case the ship should prove to be a prize, of which I had but little doubt, to show me a light as soon as he should get on board of her. The oars of his boat had scarcely ceased to resound, before I saw the welcome light ascending to the stranger's peak, and knew that another of the enemy's ships had fallen into my power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>It was now nearly daylight, and I went below and finished the nap which had been so unceremoniously broken in upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>I may as well observe here, that I scarcely ever disturbed the regular repose of the officers and crew during these night operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>Everything was done by the watch on deck, and <q direct="unspecified">all hands</q> were never called except on emergencies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>When I came on deck the next morning, there was a fine large ship lying under my lee, awaiting my orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/>She proved to be the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Tucker,,Benjamin,,," id="n0133.0033.00440.01142" reg="default:Tucker,Benjamin,,,"><foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName></hi>, of New Bedford, <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> out, with <measure n="340barrels" type="mass">three hundred and forty barrels</measure> of oil. We received from her an additional supply of tobacco, and other small stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5030"/>As early as <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, the crew of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Tucker,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00440.01143" reg="nearbymention:Tucker,Benjamin,,,"><surname>Tucker</surname></persName></hi>, numbering <num value="30">thirty</num> persons, were on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and the ship was on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5031"/>The remainder of this day, and the next, passed without incident, except the incidents of wind, and weather, which have so often been recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5032"/>We improved the leisure, by exercising the men at the guns, and caulking the decks, which were again beginning to let water enough through them, to inconvenience the men in their hammocks below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5033"/>Just as the sun was setting, on the evening of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, we caught a glimpse from the mast-head of the island of <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00440.01144" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, distant about <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5034"/>The next morning dawned bright and clear, with a smooth <pb id="p.441" n="441"/> sea, and summer clouds sailing lazily overhead, giving us just breeze enough to save us from the <hi rend="italics">ennui</hi> of a calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5035"/>As soon as the morning mists lifted themselves from the surface of the waters, a schooner appeared in sight, at no great distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5036"/>We had approached each other unwittingly during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5037"/>We immediately gave chase, hoisting the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, for the schooner was evidently <persName n="Yankee,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00441.01145" reg="mostcommon:Yankee,nomatch:0"><surname>Yankee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5038"/>She did not attempt to escape, and when, as early as <time value="7:30">half-past 7</time> A. M., we came near enough to fire a gun, and change colors, she hove to, and surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5039"/>She was the whaling-<term type="ship">schooner</term> <rs type="ship">Courser</rs>, of <placeName reg="Provincetown, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015018">Provincetown, Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5040"/>Her master was a gallant young fellow, and a fine specimen of a seaman, and if I could have separated him, in any way, from the <q direct="unspecified">Universal Yankee Nation,</q> I should have been pleased to spare his pretty little craft from the flames; but the thing was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5041"/>There were too many white-cravatted, long-haired fellows, bawling from the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New-England</placeName> pulpits, and too many house-burners and pilferers inundating our Southern land, to permit me to be generous, and so I steeled my heart, as I had done on a former occasion, and executed the laws of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5042"/>Having now the crews of the <num value="3">three</num> last ships captured, on board, amounting to about <num value="70">seventy</num>, who were not only beginning, on account of their number, and the limited accommodations of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, to be uncomfortable themselves, but were inconveniencing my own people, and hindering more or less the routine of the ship, I resolved to run back to <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00441.01146" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName>, and land them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5043"/>I had <num value="8">eight</num> whale-boats in tow, which I had brought away from the burning ships, for the purpose of landing these prisoners, and, no doubt, the islanders, as they saw my wellknown ship returning, with such a string of boats, congratulated themselves upon the prospect of other good bargains with the <rs>Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5044"/>The traffic must now have been considerable in this little island; such was the avalanche of boats, harpoons, cordage, whales' teeth, whalebones, beef, pork, tobacco, soap, and jackknives that I had thrown on shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5045"/>When we had reached sufficiently near, I shoved all the boats off at once, laden with my <measure n="70" type="prisoners">seventy prisoners</measure>, and there was quite a regatta under the lee of <persName n="Flores,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00441.01147" reg="mostcommon:Flores,nomatch:0"><surname>Flores</surname></persName> that afternoon, the boats of each ship striving to beat the others to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5046"/>The fellows seemed to be so well <pb id="p.442" n="442"/> pleased, that I believe, with a little coaxing, they would have been willing to give <num value="3">three</num> cheers for the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5047"/>We had some sport ourselves, after the prisoners had departed; for we converted the <hi rend="italics">Courser</hi> into a target, before setting fire to her, and gave the crew a little practice at her, with the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5048"/>They did pretty well for green hands, but nothing to boast of. They were now becoming somewhat familiar with the gun exercise, and in the evolutions that are usually taught sailors at general quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>Not only my excellent first lieutenant, but all the officers of the divisions, took great pains with them, and their progress was quite satisfactory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5050"/>We again stood away to the northward and westward, under easy sail, during the night, and the next day, the weather being still fine, and the breeze moderate from the south-west, in latitude about <num value="40">40</num>&deg;, and longitude <num value="33">33</num>&deg;, we chased a large ship which tried her heels with us&mdash;to no purpose, however&mdash;as we overhauled her in about <measure n="3.5hours" type="date">three hours and a half</measure>. It was another American whaling ship, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi>, only <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> out, from New Bedford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5051"/>She brought us another batch of late newspapers, and being fitted out, like the <hi rend="italics">Alert</hi>, for a long cruise, we got on board some more supplies from her. The master of this ship expressed great surprise at the speed of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, under sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5052"/>His own ship, he said, was fast, but he had stood <q direct="unspecified">no chance</q> with the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. It was like a rabbit attempting to run away from a greyhound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5053"/>We burned the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi>, when we had gotten our supplies on board, and despoiled her of such cordage, and spare sails as we needed, and stood away to the north-west again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5054"/>The torch having been applied to her rather late in the afternoon, the burning wreck was still visible some time after nightfall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5055"/>The next morning the weather had changed considerably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5056"/>It was cloudy, and rather angry-looking, and the wind was fresh and increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5057"/>We overhauled a French brig, during the day, and after detaining her no longer than was necessary to examine her papers, permitted her to depart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>We had barely turned away from the <name>Frenchman</name>, when a bark was announced from the mast-head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5059"/>We immediately gave chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5060"/>We had to wear ship for this purpose, and the bark, which seemed to have descried us, quite as soon as we had descried <pb id="p.443" n="443"/> her, observing the evolution, made all sail at once in flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>Here was another chase, and under different circumstances from any of those that had preceded it. It was blowing half a gale of wind, and it remained to be proved whether the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was as much to be dreaded in rough weather as in smooth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5062"/>Many smooth-water sailers lose their quality of speed entirely, when the seas begin to buffet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5063"/>I had the wind of the chase, and was thus enabled to run down upon her, with a flowing sheet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>I held on to my topgallant sails, though the masts buckled, and bent as though the sticks would go over the side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/>The chase did the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5066"/>It was soon quite evident that my gallant little ship was entirely at home in the roughest weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5067"/>She seemed, like a trained racer, to enjoy the sport, and though she would tremble, now and then, as she leaped from sea to sea, it was the tremor of excitement, not of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5068"/>We gained so rapidly upon the chase, that in <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> from the time the race commenced, we had her within the range of our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/>By way of a change, I had chased this ship under <name>English</name> colors, but she obstinately refused to show any colors herself, until she was compelled, by the loudmouthed command of a gun. She then ran up that <q direct="unspecified">flaunting lie,</q> the <q direct="unspecified">old flag,</q> and clewed up her topgallant sails, and hauled up her courses, and submitted to her fate, with such resignation as she might.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>I now not only took in my topgallant sails, and hauled up my courses, but furled the latter, and took a single reef in my topsails, so fresh was the wind blowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>Indeed it was so rough, that I hesitated a moment about launching my boats; but there was evidently a gale brewing, and if I did not take possession of my prize, she would in all probability escape during the darkness and tempest of the ensuing night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>I had a set of gallant, and skilful young officers around me, who would dare anything I told them to dare, and some capital seamen, and with the assistance I could give them, by manoeuvring the ship, I thought the thing could be managed; and so I ordered <num value="2">two</num> of the best boats to be launched, and manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5073"/>We were lying to, to windward of the prize, and the boats had nothing to do, of course, but to pull before the wind and sea to reach her. I directed the boarding-officers to bring off nothing <pb id="p.444" n="444"/> whatever, from the prize, in the way of property, except her chronometer, and her flag, and told them when they should have gotten the prisoners on board and were ready to return, that I would run down to leeward of the prize to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>They would thus, still, only have to pull before the wind, and the sea, to regain their ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5075"/>The prize was to be fired just before leaving her. This was all accomplished successfully; but the reader may well conceive my anxiety, as I watched those frail, tempest-tossed boats, as they were returning to me, with their human freight; now thrown high on the top of some angry wave, that dashed its foam and spray over them, as though it would swamp them, for daring thus to beard it, and now settling entirely out of sight in the trough of the sea. When they pulled under the lee of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and we threw them a rope, I was greatly relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/>This was the only ship I ever burned, before examining her papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>But as she was a whaler, and so could have no neutral cargo on board, the risk to be run was not very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5078"/>She proved to be the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Dunbar,,Elisha,,," id="n0133.0033.00444.01148" reg="default:Dunbar,Elisha,,,"><foreName>Elisha</foreName> <surname>Dunbar</surname></persName></hi> of New Bedford, <measure n="24days" type="date">twenty-four days</measure> out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5079"/>This burning ship was a beautiful spectacle, the scene being wild and picturesque beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>The black clouds were mustering their forces in fearful array.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5081"/>Already the entire heavens had been overcast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5082"/>The thunder began to roll, and crash, and the lightning to leap from cloud to cloud in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> eccentric lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5083"/>The sea was in a tumult of rage; the winds howled, and floods of rain descended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/>Amid this turmoil of the elements, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Dunbar,,,,," id="n0133.0033.00444.01149" reg="nearbymention:Dunbar,Elisha,,,"><surname>Dunbar</surname></persName></hi>, all in flames, and with disordered gear and unfurled canvas, lay rolling and tossing upon the sea. Now an ignited sail would fly away from a yard, and scud off before the gale; and now the yard itself, released from the control of its braces, would swing about wildly, as in the madness of despair, and then drop into the sea. Finally the masts went by the board, and then the hull rocked to and fro for a while, until it was filled with water, and the fire nearly quenched, when it settled to the bottom of the great deep, a victim to the passions of man, and the fury of the elements. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>I had thrown ashore there, nearly as many <name>Yankee</name> sailors as there were original inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>The gale which was described in the last chapter, did not prove to be very violent, though it blew sufficiently fresh to reduce the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> to close-reefed topsails, with the bonnets off her trysails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>It was but the forerunner of a series of gales, occurring about the period of the equinox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>The bad weather <pb id="p.446" n="446"/> had the effect to put an end to the whaling season, a little in advance of the regular time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>From the <num value="19" type="ordinal">19th</num> to the <dateStruct value="-09-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, we were constantly under reefed sails, and the wind being from the northward, we drifted as far south as the <num value="34" type="ordinal">34th</num> degree of latitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>We were now in a comparatively unfrequented part of the ocean, and had not seen a sail since the capture of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Dunbar,,Elisha,,," id="n0133.0034.00446.01154" reg="default:Dunbar,Elisha,,,"><foreName>Elisha</foreName> <surname>Dunbar</surname></persName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/>The steamer's guns being kept run out, the side ports could not be shut, and when the sea was a little rough, or the vessel rolled, the water was continually coming in on both sides, and washing across the deck where we were, so that our feet and clothing were wet all the time, either from the water below, or the rain above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5111"/>The above statement is substantially correct, with the exception that the prisoners were not drenched with sea-water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5112"/>or with the rain, all the time, as is pretended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5113"/>It is quite true that they were compelled to live, and sleep on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5114"/>We had nowhere else to put them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5115"/>My berth-deck was filled with my <pb id="p.447" n="447"/> own crew, and it was not possible to berth prisoners there, without turning my own men out of their hammocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5116"/>To remedy this difficulty, we spread a tent, made of spare sails, and which was quite tight, in the lee waist, and laid gratings upon the deck, to keep the men and their bedding as dry as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>Ordinarily they were very comfortable, but sometimes, during the prevalence of gales, they were, no doubt, a little disturbed in their slumbers by the water, as <persName n="Tilton,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0034.00447.01158" reg="mostcommon:Tilton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Tilton</surname></persName> says.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5118"/>But I discharged them all in good physical condition, and this is the best evidence I could give, that they were well cared for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5119"/>He was, as he says, ordered off the quarter-deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5120"/>That is a place sacred to the officers of the ship, where even their own crew are not permitted to come, except on duty, and much less a prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5121"/>He explains, himself, as I had previously explained to the reader, how he came to be put in irons.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5157"/>The change from <num value="1">one</num> cruising-ground to another, during which no vessels were sighted, afforded my crew a muchneeded relaxation of a few days, for they had been much fagged and worn during the last month, by a succession of captures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>That which had been but a pleasurable excitement, in the beginning, soon became a wearing and exhausting labor, and they were glad to be relieved, for a time, from the chasing and burning of ships, hard service in boats during all kinds of weather, and the wet jackets and sleepless nights, which had sometimes been the consequences of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5159"/>I will avail myself of this comparative calm, in the moral atmosphere on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, to introduce the reader, more particularly, to our interior life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>I propose to give him a sight of my military family, and show him how my children played as well as worked; how I governed them, and with what toys I amused them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>From the very beginning of our captures, an order had been issued, that no sailor should lay his hand on any article of property, to appropriate it to his own use, unless by permission of an officer; and especially that no spirituous liquors should be brought on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. It was made the duty of every boarding-officer, upon getting on board a prize, to demand possession of the keys of the liquor-lockers, and either to cause the liquor to be destroyed, or thrown overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5163"/>To the rigid enforcement of this rule, I attribute much of the good order which prevailed on board my ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5164"/>It was enforced against the officers, as well the men, and no officer's mess was allowed to supply itself with liquor, by purchase, or otherwise, unless by my consent; and I never gave this consent <pb id="p.451" n="451"/> to the midshipmen's mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5165"/>We burned, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, a ship, whose entire cargo consisted of <name>French</name> brandies, and champagne, and other wines, without allowing a bottle of it to be brought on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5166"/>But whilst I used these precautions, I caused a regular allowance of <q direct="unspecified">grog</q> to be served out to the crew, twice in each day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5167"/>Such articles of clothing and supplies as were captured, were turned over to the paymaster, to be credited to the <rs>Government</rs>, and duly issued and charged to the crew, as if they had been purchased in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5168"/>In spite of all these precautions, however, a sailor would now and then be brought on board from a prize, drunk, would manage to smuggle liquor to his comrades, and would be found arrayed in all sorts of strange garbs, from whaler's boots, and <rs n="red flannel" type="product">red flannel</rs> shirts and comforters, to longtailed coats and beaver hats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5169"/>Notwithstanding the discipline of the ship, the gravity of the crew would sometimes give way to merriment, as <num value="1">one</num> of these fellows, thus ludicruously apparelled, would have to be hoisted or lifted on board, being too comfortably drunk to attend to his own locomotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5170"/>Each offender knew that he would have to walk straight into the <q direct="unspecified">Brig,</q> upon being thus detected in the violation of these orders, and that punishment would speedily follow the offence; and yet I found it <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult parts of my duty, to convince some of these free-and-easy fellows, who had mistaken the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, when they signed the articles off <placeName key="tgn,1009414" n="1.000 10" reg="Terceira,Angra do Heroismo,Ilhas dos Acores,Portugal,Europe">Terceira</placeName>, (after that stump speech before referred to,) for what <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0034.00451.01171" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> and <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0034.00451.01172" reg="mostcommon:Adams,Charles,Francis,,:5"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> insisted she was, a <q direct="unspecified">privateer,</q> that everything was captured in the name of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and that nothing belonged to them personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5171"/>The California-bound ships frequently had on board boxes and bales of fine clothing, boots, shoes, and hats, but not a garment was allowed to be brought on board except such as the paymaster might need for issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5172"/>It seemed hard to consign all these tempting articles to the flames, without permitting the sailors to help themselves, but if such license had been permitted, disorder and demoralization would have been the consequence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5173"/>I had no chaplain on board, but Sunday was always kept as <pb id="p.452" n="452"/> a day of abstinence from labor, when the exigencies of war and weather would permit, and it was my uniform practice on this day, to have the ship thoroughly cleansed, in every part, for inspection&mdash;particularly the sleeping apartments, and the engineroom&mdash;and to require the officers and seamen to appear on the quarter-deck for muster; the former in their appropriate uniforms, and the latter in clean duck frocks and trousers, or other clothing adapted to the latitude and climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5174"/>The reader has already been present at several of these musters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5175"/>The boys of the ship, of whom I had quite a number on board, were placed under the special charge of the master-at-arms&mdash; a subordinate officer, with police-powers, in charge of the berth-deck&mdash;whose duty it was to inspect them, in every morning watch, with reference to personal cleanliness; turning down the collars, and rolling up the trousers of the youngsters, to see that they had duly performed their ablutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5176"/>These boys had been taken from the stews, and haunts of vice about <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, and were as great a set of scamps as any disciplinarian could desire to <q direct="unspecified">lick into shape,</q> but it is astonishing what a reformation soap and water and the master-at-arms effected in them, in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5177"/>Many of them became very respectable young fellows, for which they were indebted almost entirely to the free use of soap and water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5178"/>As a hygienic precaution, when we were cruising in warm latitudes, where the dews were heavy, the whole crew was required to appear, every evening, at sunset muster, in blue flannel shirts and trousers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5179"/>They could then sleep in the dews, without the fear of colds or rheumatisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5180"/>We were always supplied with the best of provisions, for, being at war with a provision-producing people, almost every ship we captured afforded us a greater or less supply; and all the water that was drank on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was condensed by the engine from the vapor of sea-water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5181"/>The consequence of all this care was highly gratifying to me, as, in the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> I was afloat, I did not lose a man by disease, in either of my ships!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5182"/>When it is recollected that I cruised in all parts of the world, now fencing out the cold, and battling with the storms of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">North Atlantic</placeName> and South Indian Oceans, and now being fried, and baked, and stewed within the tropics, <pb id="p.453" n="453"/> and on the equator, and that, besides my own crews, some <num value="2000">two thousand</num> of the enemy's sailors passed through my hands, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and last, as prisoners, this is a remarkable statement to be able to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5184"/>On week days we mustered the crew at their quarters twice a day&mdash;at <time value="9am">nine A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5185"/>This not only gave them efficiency in the use of their weapons, but kept them employed&mdash;the constant employment of my men being a fundamental article of my philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5186"/>I found the old adage, that <q direct="unspecified">Idleness is the parent of vice,</q> as true upon the sea as upon the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5187"/>My crew were never so happy as when they had plenty to do, and but little to think about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5188"/>Indeed, as to the thinking, I allowed them to do very little of that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5189"/>Whenever I found I had a sea-lawyer among them, I got rid of him as soon as possible&mdash;giving him a chance to desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5190"/>I reserved the <hi rend="italics">quids</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">quos</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">pros</hi> and <hi rend="italics">cons</hi>, exclusively for myself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>But though I took good care to see that my men had plenty of employment, it was not all work with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5192"/>They had their pastimes and pleasures, as well as labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5193"/>After the duties of the day were over, they would generally assemble on the forecastle, and, with violin, and tambourine&mdash;and I always kept them supplied with these and other musical instruments&mdash;they would extemporize a ball-room, by moving the shot-racks, coils of rope, and other impediments, out of the way, and, with handkerchiefs tied around the waists of some of them, to indicate who were to be the ladies of the party, they would get up a dance with all due form and ceremony; the ladies, in particular, endeavoring to imitate all the airs and graces of the sex&mdash;the only drawback being a little hoarseness of the voice, and now and then the use of an expletive, which would escape them when something went wrong in the dance, and they forgot they had the aprons on. The favorite dancingtunes were those of Wapping and <address><street n="Wide Water Street">Wide Water Street</street></address>, and when I speak of the airs and graces, I must be understood to <pb id="p.454" n="454"/> mean those rather demonstrative airs and graces, of which Poll and <persName n="Peggy,,,,," id="n0133.0034.00454.01175" reg="mostcommon:Peggy,nomatch:0"><surname>Peggy</surname></persName> would be likely to be mistresses of.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5194"/>Sometimes the recreation of the dance would be varied, and songs and story-telling would be the amusements of the evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5195"/>The sea is a wide net, which catches all kinds of fish, and in a man-of-war's crew a great many odd characters are always to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5197"/>These gentlemen play a very unimportant <hi rend="italics">role</hi> in seamanship, but they take a high rank among the crew, when fun and frolic, and not seamanship, are the order of the day&mdash;or rather night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5200"/>Some of these latter were equal to the <rs>Italian</rs> <hi rend="italics">lazzaroni</hi>, and could extemporize yarns by the hour; and there is nothing of which a sailor is half so fond as a yarn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5201"/>It was my custom, on these occasions, to go forward on the bridge&mdash;a light structure spanning the deck, near amidships &mdash;which, in the twilight hours, was a sort of lounging-place for the officers, and smoke my single cigar, and listen to whatever might be going on, almost as much amused as the sailors themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/>So rigid is the discipline of a ship of war, that the captain is necessarily much isolated from his officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>He messes alone, walks the quarter-deck alone, and rarely, during the hours of duty, exchanges, even with his first lieutenant, or officer of the deck, other conversation than such as relates to the ship, or the service she is upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>On the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, the following record is found upon my journal: <q direct="unspecified">The gale moderated during the last night, but the weather, to-day, has been thick and rainy, with the wind from the north-west, and a confused, rough sea. No observation for latitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5219"/>The barometer, which had gone down to <num value="29.8">29.8</num> is rising, and stands at <time value="9pm">nine P. M.</time> at <num value="29.9">29.9</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5220"/>The ship being about <measure n="200miles" type="distance">two hundred miles</measure> only, from the <name>Banks</name> of <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>, we are trying the temperature of the air and water every hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5221"/>At <time value="9pm">nine P. M.</time> we found the temperature of the former to be <num value="63">63</num>&deg;, and of the latter <num value="70">70</num>&deg;, indicating that we have passed into the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5222"/>The thick, rainy weather is almost as unerring a sign of the presence of this stream as the thermometer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5223"/>The stream into which we have now passed is, literally, an immense salt-water river in the sea. Coming out of the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>, it has brought the temperature of the tropics, all the way to the <name>Banks</name> of <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>, in the latitude of <num value="50">50</num>&deg; north, and it has run this distance between banks, or walls of cold water, on either side, parting with very little of its warmth, by the way. When it is recollected that this salt-water river in the sea is about <num value="3000">three thousand</num> times larger than the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName>, that is to say, that it brings out of the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName>, <num value="3000">three thousand</num> times as much water, as that river empties into it, and that all this great body of water is carried up into the hyperborean regions of <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>, at a temperature, even in mid-winter, ranging from <num value="73">73</num> to <num value="78">78</num> degrees, it will be seen at once what a powerful weather-breeder it must be. Accordingly, no port of the world is more stormy than the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, off the north-eastern coast of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the <name>Banks</name> of <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5224"/>Such is the quantity of heat brought daily by this stream, and placed in juxtaposition with the rigors of a Northern winter, that it is estimated, that if it were suddenly stricken from it, it would <pb id="p.457" n="457"/> be sufficient to make the column of superincumbent atmosphere hotter than melted iron!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5225"/>With such an element of atmospheric disturbance, it is not wonderful that the most terrific gales, that rage on the ocean, are wont to sweep over the surface of this stream.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5226"/>Indeed, this stream not only generates hurricanes of its own, it seems to attract to it such as are engendered in the most distant parts of our hemisphere; for hurricanes known to have originated near <placeName reg="Cape St. Roque">Cape St. Roque</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,1000047;tgn,2031163" n="0.012 000000.7068	placename;tgn,1000047;brasil,South America;0.006 000000.3636	placename;tgn,2031163;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="brasil,South America;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America">Brazil</placeName>, have made their way straight for the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, and followed it, in its course, for a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> and more, spreading shipwreck and disaster, broadcast, in their track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5227"/>The violence of these gales is inconceivable by those who have not witnessed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5228"/>The great hurricane of <dateStruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></dateStruct> originated to the eastward of the island of <placeName key="tgn,7004770" n="1.000 8" reg="barbados">Barbadoes</placeName>, and made straight for the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5229"/>As it passed over the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India Islands</placeName>, trees were uprooted, and the bark literally blown from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5230"/>The very bottom and depths of the sea, in the vicinity of some of the islands, were uncovered, and rocks torn up, and new channels formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5231"/>The waves rose to such a height, that forts, and castles, removed, as it was thought, far out of the reach of the water, were washed away, and the storm, taking hold of their <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>, played with it, as with so many straws, throwing it to considerable distances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5232"/>Houses were razed, and ships wrecked, and the bodies of men and beasts were lifted up into the air and dashed to pieces in the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5233"/>Still, the European-bound ships defy all the bad weather, so prevalent in this stream, on account of the easterly current which accelerates their passage, at the rate of from <num value="2">two</num>, to <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, per hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5234"/>The stream, therefore, has been literally bearded by commerce, and has become <num value="1">one</num> of its principal highways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5235"/>It is because it is a highway of commerce that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> now finds herself in it. Nor was she long in it, before the travellers on the highway began to come along.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5236"/>Early on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-10-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, <num value="2">two</num> sail were simultaneously reported by the look-out at the mast-head&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> right ahead, and the other on the lee-bow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5237"/>As both the ships were standing in our direction, there was no necessity for a chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5238"/>We had nothing to do but await their approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>As <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> their hulls were lifted above the horizon, we could see that they were fine, large ships, with a profusion of tapering spars and white canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5240"/>We at once pronounced them American; and so, after a little, they proved to be. They were, in fact, the <hi rend="italics">avant courriers</hi> of the <q direct="unspecified">unk fleet,</q> for which we had come to look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5241"/>The wind was light, and they came on, with all their sails set, from truck to rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5242"/>We, on our part, put on an air of perfect indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5243"/>We made no change in our sail, and it was not necessary to alter our course, as the strangers would pass sufficiently near us, unless they altered their own courses, which they did not seem inclined to do. They apparently had no suspicion of our real character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5244"/>We did not hoist any colors, until the vessels were nearly abreast of us, and only a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards distant</measure>, when, suddenly wheeling, we fired a gun, and hoisted the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5245"/>The capture of these <num value="2">two</num> ships must have been a perfect surprise to them, judging by the confusion that was visible on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5246"/>There was a running about the decks, and an evident indecision for a few moments, as to what was best to be done; but it did not take the masters long to take an intelligent view of the <q direct="unspecified">situation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5247"/>There was nothing to be done, but surrender; and this they did, by hoisting their colors, and heaving to their ships.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5248"/>We now shortened sail, and laying the maintopsail to the mast, lowered a couple of quarter boats, and boarded the prizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5249"/><num value="1">One</num> of them proved to be the <hi rend="italics">Brilliant</hi>, from New York, for <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, laden with flour and grain; and the other, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Farnum,,Emily,,," id="n0133.0034.00458.01181" reg="default:Farnum,Emily,,,"><foreName>Emily</foreName> <surname>Farnum</surname></persName></hi>, from New York, for <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, with a similar cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5250"/>The cargo of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Farnum,,,,," id="n0133.0034.00458.01182" reg="nearbymention:Farnum,Emily,,,"><surname>Farnum</surname></persName></hi> being properly documented as neutral property, I released her on ransom-bond, and converting her into a cartel, sent on board of her all my prisoners, of whom I had <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, besides those just captured in the <hi rend="italics">Brilliant</hi>. The latter ship was burned, and her destruction must have disappointed a good many holders of bills of exchange, drawn against her cargo, as this was large and valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5251"/>The owners of the ship have since put in a claim, in that little bill, which <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0034.00458.01183" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> has pressed with so little effect hitherto against the <rs>British Government</rs>, for indemnity for the <q direct="unspecified">depredations of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>,</q> <pb id="p.459" n="459"/> for the ship alone, and the freight-moneys which they lost by her destruction, to the amount of <measure n="93000dollars" type="currency">$93,000</measure>. The cargo was probably even more valuable than the ship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5252"/>I made a positive stipulation with the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Farnum,,,,," id="n0133.0034.00459.01184" reg="nearbymention:Farnum,Emily,,,"><surname>Farnum</surname></persName></hi>, upon releasing her, that she should continue her voyage to <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, and not put back into any American port; the master pledging me his word that he would comply with it. My object was, of course, to prevent him from giving news of me to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5253"/>He had no sooner passed out of sight, however, steering his course for <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, than he dodged and put into <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and reported me. This being nothing more than a clever <q direct="unspecified"><name>Yankee</name> trick,</q> of course there was no harm done the master's honor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5254"/>I was much moved by the entreaties of the master of the <hi rend="italics">Brilliant</hi> to spare his ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5255"/>He was a hard-working seaman, who owned a <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> interest in her. He had built her, and was attached to her, and she represented all his worldly goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5256"/>But I was forced again to steel my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>He was, like the other masters who had remonstrated with me, in the same boat with the <q direct="unspecified">political rascals,</q> who had egged on the war; and I told him he must look to those rascals for redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>The ship made a brilliant bonfire, lighting up the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, for many miles around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5259"/>Having been set on fire near night, and the wind falling to nearly a calm, we remained in sight of the burning wreck nearly all night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5260"/>Among the many slanders against me, to which the <rs>Northern</rs> press gave currency during the war, it was stated, that I decoyed ships into my power, by setting fire to my prizes at night, and remaining by them in ambuscade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5261"/>Of course, when seamen discover a ship on fire at sea they rush, with all their manly sympathies aroused, to the rescue of their comrades, who are supposed to be in danger; but if they should find, it was said, that they were waylaid, and captured, none would go to the rescue in future, and thus many seamen would perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5262"/>It can scarcely be necessary for me to say, that I never purposely lay by a burning ship, by night, or by day, longer than <hi rend="italics">to see her well on fire</hi>. The substantial answer to the slander is, that I never captured a ship, under the circumstances stated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5263"/>For the next few days we had fine, clear weather, and chased and overhauled a number of neutral ships, most of them out of <pb id="p.460" n="460"/> New York, and bound for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, laden with grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5265"/>These were not the sort of <q direct="unspecified">junks</q> that we were in quest of, but they compensated us, somewhat, for the time and labor lost in chasing and boarding them, by supplying us with late newspapers of the enemy, and giving us valuable information concerning the progress of the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5266"/>On the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="-10-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, the weather being fine, and the breeze light, we chased and captured the <name n="United States">American</name> <term type="ship">bark</term>, <rs type="ship">Wave Crest</rs>, from New York, bound for <placeName reg="Cardiff,Cardiff,Wales,United Kingdom,Europe" key="tgn,7008742">Cardiff, in Wales</placeName>, with flour and grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>In the language of the enemy, we <q direct="unspecified">plundered her,</q> that is, we received on board from her, such articles as we needed, and after having made use of her for a while, as a target, at which to practise the men at the battery, we burned her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5268"/>Filing away, we again made sail to the north-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5269"/>We were now, in about latitude <num value="41">41</num>&deg;, and longitude <num value="54">54</num>&deg;, and were working our way, under easy sail, toward the coasts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5270"/>Just before nightfall, on the same afternoon, another sail was cried from aloft, and we made all sail in pursuit, immediately, anxious to draw sufficiently near the chase before dark, to prevent losing sight of her. By this time, the wind, which had been very light all day, had freshened to a stiff breeze, and the chase, soon perceiving our object, spread a cloud of canvas, with studding-sails <q direct="unspecified">alow and aloft,</q> in the effort to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5271"/>She had seen the fire of the burning <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Crest,,Wave,,," id="n0133.0034.00460.01186" reg="default:Crest,Wave,,,"><foreName>Wave</foreName> <surname>Crest</surname></persName></hi>, and knew full well the doom that awaited her, if she were overtaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5272"/>As night threw her mantle over the scene, the moon, nearly at the full, rose with unusual splendor and lighted up the sea for the chase; and a beautiful, picturesque chase it was. Although it lasted several hours, our anxiety as to the result was relieved, in a very short time, for we could see, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that we gained upon the fleeing ship, although her master practised every stratagem known to the skilful seaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5273"/>As soon as we approached sufficiently near to get a good view of her through our excellent night-glasses, which, in the bright moonlight, brought out all her features almost as distinctly as if we had been viewing them by the rays of the sun, we discovered <pb id="p.461" n="461"/> that she was <num value="1">one</num> of those light, and graceful hermaphrodite brigs, that is, a rig between the brig and the schooner, so peculiarly American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5274"/>Her sails were beautifully cut, well hoisted, and the clews well spread; her masts were long and tapering, and her yards more square than usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>There was just sea enough on, to give her, now and then, a gentle motion, as she rose upon a wave, and scudded forward with renewed impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>Her sails looked not unlike so many silver wings, in the weird moonlight, and with a little effort of the imagination, it would not have been difficult to think of her as some immense water-fowl, which had been scared from its roost and flown seaward for safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/>I sat astride of the hammock-cloth on the weather-quarter, and watched the beautiful apparition during the whole chase, only taking off my eye, now and then, to give some order to the officer of the deck, or to cast it admiringly upon the buckling and bending masts and spars of my own beautiful ship, as she sped forward, with all the animation of a living thing, in pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>The poor little, affrighted fawn ahead of us, how its heart must have gone pit-a-pat, as it cast its timid eyes behind it, and saw its terrible pursuer looming up larger, and larger, and coming nearer and nearer!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/>Still there might be some hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5280"/>The pursuing vessel might be some peaceful merchantship, bound on the same errand of commerce with herself, and only trying heels with her, in sport, over these dancing waves, and by this bright moonlight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>Alas! the hope was short-lived; for presently, in the stillness of near <time value="12am">midnight</time>, a flash was seen, followed by the sound of a booming gun, and there could no longer be any doubt, that the pursuer was a ship of war, and most likely a Confederate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5282"/>Halliards and tacks, and sheets were let fly on board the brigantine, and as soon as her seamen could gather in the folds of the flapping sails, and haul up clew-garnets, her helm was put down, and she rounded gracefully to the now whistling wind, with fore-topsail aback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5283"/>So rapidly had this been done, and so close was the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> upon the chase, that we had just time to sheer clear of her by a little trick of the helm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5284"/>Our own sail was now shortened, and the boarding-officer dispatched on board the prize.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5285"/>She proved to be the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2068864" n="1.000 13" reg="dunkirk, chautauqua, new york">Dunkirk</placeName></hi>, from New York, with a cargo <pb id="p.462" n="462"/> of grain for <placeName reg="Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,7010978">Lisbon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5286"/>There being no evidence of neutral ownership of the cargo, among the papers, she was burned, as soon as her crew could be transferred to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. We made <num value="2">two</num> novel captures on board this ship&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> was a deserter from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, a worthless sailor out of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, whom we afterward discharged from the <rs>Confederate Naval</rs> service, in disgrace, instead of hanging him, as we might have done under our Articles of War; and the other a number of very neatly put up <hi rend="italics">tracts</hi> in the <name>Portuguese</name> language; our Northern brethren dealing in a little piety as well as trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5287"/>These tracts had been issued by that pious corporation, the <q direct="unspecified"><orgName n="American Tract Society" type="society">American Tract Society</orgName>,</q> of New York, whose fine fat offices are filled with sleek, well-fed parsons, of the <name>Boynton</name> stripe, whose business it is to prey upon the credulity of kind-hearted American women, and make a pretence of converting the heathen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5288"/>On the cover of these tracts was printed the following directions, as to how the doses were to be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5289"/><q direct="unspecified">Portuguese tracts, from the <quote><orgName n="American Tract Society" type="society">American tract society</orgName>,</quote> for distribution among Portuguese passengers, and to give, upon the coast, to visitors from the shore, &amp;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5290"/>A pen had been run through the last injunction, as though the propagandists of <q direct="unspecified">grand moral ideas</q> had become a little bolder since the war, and were determined to thrust their piety down the throats of the <name>Portuguese</name>, whether they would or not.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5341"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013989">Manchester</placeName></hi> brought us a batch of late New York papers, and I was much obliged to the editors of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <name>Herald</name></orgName>, for valuable information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5344"/>The reader will observe, that I received my mails quite regularly, now, from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5345"/>They were sometimes daily, and rarely less frequent than tri-weekly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5347"/>They might give valuable information of the objects and designs of the enemy, and throw some light upon the true ownership of cargoes, falsely documented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5348"/>I therefore took the liberty, which the laws of war gave me, of breaking the seals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5349"/>There were some curious developments made in some of these letters, nor were they all written on business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5350"/>Sometimes, as I would break a seal, a photograph would tumble out, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few lines of the letter would inform me of a tender passion <pb id="p.468" n="468"/> that was raging in the heart of the writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5355"/>When the nationality of these was distinctly marked, as generally it was, we forbore to chase them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5356"/>The weather began now to give unmistakable signs, of a general disturbance of the atmospheric machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5357"/>On the <dateStruct value="-10-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, we captured our next ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5358"/>It was blowing half a gale of wind, with a thick atmosphere, and rain-squalls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5359"/>We were lying to, under topsails, when she was reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5360"/>As in the case of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Manchester, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,7013989">Manchester</placeName></hi>, we had only to await her approach, for we were still in the beaten track of these lone travellers upon the sea. She came along quite fast, before the gale, and when within reach, we hove her to, with the accustomed gun. She proved, upon being boarded, to be the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Lamplighter</rs>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, from New York, for <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Berks, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2088729">Gibraltar</placeName>, with a cargo of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5361"/>There was no attempt to cover the cargo, and when we had removed the crew to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, we burned her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5362"/>From the frequent mention which has been made of <q direct="unspecified">uncovered cargoes,</q> the reader will see how careless the enemy's merchants were, and how little they dreamed of disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5363"/>They had not yet heard of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, except only that she had escaped from <placeName reg="Liverpool, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2070247">Liverpool</placeName>, as the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="290">290</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5364"/>They looked upon her, yet, as a mere myth, which it was not necessary to take any precautions against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5365"/>But the reader will see how soon their course will change, and in what demand British Consular certificates, vouching for the neutrality of good American cargoes, will be, in the good city of <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">Gotham</placeName>, toward which, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> is slowly working her way.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5366"/>We captured the <hi rend="italics">Lamplighter</hi> early in the day, and it was well for us she came along when she did. If she had delayed <pb id="p.469" n="469"/> her arrival a few hours, we should probably not have been able to board her, so much had the gale increased, and the sea risen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5367"/>For the next few days, as the reader will speedily see, we had as much as we could do to take care of ourselves, without thinking of the enemy, or his ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5368"/>We had a fearful gale to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5369"/>As this gale was a cyclone, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> really severe gale that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had met with, it is worthy of a brief description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5370"/>We begin, in our generation, to have some definite knowledge of the atmospheric laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5371"/>To our ancestors, of only a generation or <num value="2">two</num> back, these laws were almost a sealed book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5372"/>It is now well ascertained, that all the great hurricanes which sweep over the seas, are cyclones; that is, circular gales, revolving around an axis, or vortex, at the same time that they are travelling in a given direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5373"/>These gales all have their origin in warm latitudes, or, as has been prettily said, by an officer of the <rs>Dutch Navy</rs> writing on the subject, they <q direct="unspecified">prefer to place their feet in warm water.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5374"/>They do not, however, confine themselves to the places of their origin, but, passing out of the tropics, sweep over large tracts of extra-tropical seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5375"/>These circular gales are the great regulators, or balancewheels, as it were, of the atmospheric machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5376"/>They arise in seasons of atmospheric disturbance, and seem necessary to the restoration of the atmospheric equilibrium.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5377"/>In the <name>East Indian</name> and <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> seas, the cyclone is called a typhoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5378"/>It prevails there with even more destructive effect than in the western hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5379"/>It takes its origin during the change of the monsoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5380"/>Monsoons are periodical winds, which blow <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the year from <num value="1">one</num> direction&mdash;the north-east for example&mdash;and then change, and blow the other half of the year, from the opposite direction, the south-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5381"/>When these monsoons are changing, there is great disturbance in the atmospheric equilibrium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5382"/>A battle of the winds, as it were, takes place; the out-going wind struggling for existence, and the in-coming wind endeavoring to throttle it, and take its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5383"/>Calms, whirlwinds, water-spouts, and heavy and drenching rains set in; the black, wild-looking clouds, sometimes rent and torn, sweeping with their heavy burdens of vapor over the very surface of the sea. Now, the out-going, <pb id="p.470" n="470"/> or dying monsoon will recede, for days together, its enemy, the in-coming monsoon, greedily advancing to occupy the space left vacant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5384"/>The retreating wind will then rally, regain its courage, and drive back, at least for a part of the way, the pursuing wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5385"/>In this way, the <num value="2">two</num> will alternate for weeks, each watching the other as warily, as if they were opposing armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5386"/>It is during these struggles, when the atmosphere is unhinged, as it were, that the typhoon makes its awful appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5387"/>Every reader is familiar with the phenomenon of the miniature whirlwind, which he has so often seen sweep along a street or road, for a short distance, and then disappear; the want of local equilibrium in the atmosphere, which gave rise to it, having been restored.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5388"/>These little whirlwinds generally occur at street-corners, or at cross-roads, and are produced by the meeting of <num value="2">two</num> winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5389"/>When these winds meet, the stronger will bend the weaker, and a whirl will ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5390"/>The <num value="2">two</num> winds still coming on, the whirl will be increased, and thus a whirlwind is formed, which immediately begins to travel&mdash;not at random, of course, but in the direction of least pressure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5391"/>The meeting of <num value="2">two</num> currents of water, which form a whirlpool, may be used as another illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5392"/>It is just so, that the typhoon is formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5393"/>It steps in as a great conservator of the peace, to put an end to the atmospherical strife which has been going on, and to restore harmony to nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5394"/>It is a terrible scourge whilst it lasts; the whole heavens seem to be in disorder, and that which was only a partial battle between outposts of the aerial armies, has now become a general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5395"/>The great whirl sweeps over a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> or more, and when it has ceased, nature smiles again; the old monsoon has given up the ghost, and the new monsoon has taken its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5396"/>All will be peace now until the next change&mdash;the storms that will occur in the interval, being more or less local.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5397"/>We have monsoons in the western hemisphere, as well as in the eastern, though they are much more partial, both in space and duration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5398"/>The cyclones which sweep over the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">North Atlantic</placeName> are generated, as has been remarked, to the eastward of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India Islands</placeName>&mdash;somewhere between them and the coast of <placeName key="tgn,2031163;tgn,1000047" n="0.016 000000.9916	placename;tgn,2031163;brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.012 000000.7068	placename;tgn,1000047;brasil,South America" reg="brazil, clay, indiana,Clay,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;brasil,South America">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5400"/>In these months, the sun has drawn after him, into the northern hemisphere, the south-east trade-winds of the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">South Atlantic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5401"/>These tradewinds are now struggling with the north-east trade-winds, which prevail in these seas, for <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the year, for the mastery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5402"/>We have, thus, another monsoon struggle going on; and the consequence of this struggle is the cyclone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5403"/>The reader may recollect the appearances of the weather, noted by me, some chapters back, when we were in these seas, in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct>, of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; to wit, the calms, light, baffling winds, water-spouts, and heavy rains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5404"/>If the reader will pay a little attention to the diagram on <ref n="page 473">page 473</ref>, it will assist him, materially, in comprehending the nature of the storm into which the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had now entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5405"/>The outer circle represents the extent of the storm; the inner circle, the centre or vortex; the arrows along the inner edge of the outer circle represent the direction, or gyration of the wind, and the dotted line represents the course travelled by the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5406"/>The figures marked, <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="2">2</num>, and <num value="3">3</num>, represent the position of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, in the different stages of the storm, as it passed over her; the arrow-heads on the figures representing the head of the ship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5407"/>If the reader, being in the northern hemisphere, will turn his face toward the sun, at his rising, and watch his course for a short time, he will observe that this course is from left to right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5408"/>As the course of the arrows in the figure is from right to left, the reader observes that the gyration of the wind, in the storm, is <hi rend="italics">against the course of the sun</hi>. This is an invariable law in both hemispheres; but, in the southern hemisphere, the reader will not fail to remark, that the gyration of the wind is in the opposite direction from its gyration in the northern hemisphere, for the reason, that, to an observer in the southern hemisphere the sun appears to be moving, not from left to right, but from right to left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5409"/>Whilst, therefore, the storm, in the northern hemisphere, gyrates from right to left, in the southern hemisphere, it gyrates from left to right; both gyrations being <hi rend="italics">against the course of the sun</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5410"/>This is a curious phenomenon, which has, thus far, puzzled all the philosophers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5411"/>It is a double puzzle; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, why the <pb id="p.472" n="472"/> storm should gyrate always in the same direction, and secondly, why this gyration should be different in the <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5412"/>The law seems to be so subtle, as utterly to elude investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5413"/>There is a curious phenomenon, in the vegetable world, which seems to obey this law of storms, and which I do not recollect ever to have seen alluded to by any writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5414"/>It may be well known to horticulturists, for aught that I know, but it attracted my attention, in my own garden, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, since the war. It is, that all creeping vines, and tendrils, when they wind themselves around a pole, invariably wind themselves from right to left, or <hi rend="italics">against the course of the sun</hi>! I was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> struck with the fact, by watching, from day to day, the tender unfolding of the <name>Lira</name> bean&mdash;each little creeper, as it came forth, feeling, as with the instinct of animal life, for the pole, and then <hi rend="italics">invariably</hi> bending around it, in the direction mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5415"/>I have a long avenue of these plants, numbering several <num value="100">hundred</num> poles, and upon examining them all, I invariably found the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5416"/>I tried the experiment with some of these little creepers, of endeavoring to compel them to embrace the pole from left to right, or <hi rend="italics">with the course of the sun</hi>, but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5417"/>In the afternoon I would gather blades of grass, and tie some of the tendrils to the poles, in a way to force them to disobey the law, but when I went to inspect them, the following morning, I would invariably find, that the obedient little plants <hi rend="italics">had turned back</hi>, and taken the accustomed track!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5418"/>What is the subtle influence which produces this wonderful result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5419"/>May it not be the same law which rides on the whirlwind, and directs the storm?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5420"/>The cyclone, of which I am writing, must have travelled a couple of <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure>, before it reached the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. Its approach had been heralded, as the reader has seen, by several days of bad weather; and, on the morning of the gale, which was on the <dateStruct value="-10-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, the barometer&mdash;that faithful sentinel of the seaman&mdash;began to settle very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5421"/>We had been under short sail before, but we now took the close reefs in the topsails, which tied them down to about <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of their original size, got up, and bent the main storm-staysail, which was made of the stoutest <num value="1">No. 1</num> canvas, and scarcely larger than a pocket-handkerchief, swung in the quarter-boats, <pb id="p.473" n="473"/> <figure id="fig.473"> 
<head>Diagram of the cyclone experienced by the <rs>Alabama</rs> on the <dateStruct value="1862-10-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</head></figure> <pb id="p.474" n="474"/> and passed additional lashings around them; and, in short, made all the requisite preparations for the battle with the elements which awaited us. If the reader will east his eye upon the diagram, at <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, <num value="1">No. 1</num>, he will see that the ship has her head to the eastward, that her yards are braced up on the starboard tack, and that she took the wind, as indicated by the arrows, from S. to S. S. E.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5422"/>The ship is lying still, and the storm, which the reader sees, by the dotted line, is travelling to the north-east, is approaching her. She was soon enveloped in its folds; and the winds, running around the circle, in that mad career represented by the arrows, howled, and whistled, and screeched around her like a <num value="1000">thousand</num> demons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5423"/>She was thrown over, several streaks, and the waves began to assault her with sledge-hammer blows, and occasionally to leap on board of her, flooding her decks, and compelling us to stand knee-deep in water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5424"/>By this time, we had furled the fore-topsail; the fore-staysail had been split into ribbons; and whilst I was anxiously debating with myself, whether I should hold on to the main-topsail, a little longer, or start its sheets, and let it blow to pieces&mdash;for it would have been folly to think of sending men aloft in such a gale, to furl it&mdash;the iron bolt on the weather-quarter, to which the standing part of the main-brace was made fast, gave way; away went the main-yard, parted at the slings, and, in a trice, the main-topsail was whipped into fragments, and tied into a <num value="100">hundred</num> curious knots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5425"/>We were now under nothing but the small storm-staysail, described; the topgallant yards had been sent down from aloft, there was very little top-hamper exposed to the wind, and yet the ship was pressed over and over, until I feared she would be thrown upon her beam-ends, or her masts swept by the board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5426"/>The lee-quarter-boat was wrenched from the davits, and dashed in pieces; and, as the sea would strike the ship, forward or aft, she would tremble in every fibre, as if she had been a living thing, in fear of momentary dissolution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5427"/>But she behaved nobly, and I breathed easier after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half hour of the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5428"/>All hands were, of course, on deck, with the hatches battened down, and there was but little left for us to do, but to watch the course of the storm, and to ease the <pb id="p.475" n="475"/> ship, all it was possible to ease her, with the helm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5429"/>Life-lines had been rove, fore and aft the decks, by my careful first lieutenant, to prevent the crew from being washed overboard, and it was almost as much as each man could do, to look out for his own personal safety.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5430"/>The storm raged thus violently for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, the barometer settling all the while, until it reached <num value="28.64">28.64</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5431"/>It then fell suddenly calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5432"/>Landsmen have heard of an <q direct="unspecified">ominous</q> calm, but this calm seemed to us almost like the fiat of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5433"/>We knew, at once, that we were in the terrible vortex of a cyclone, from which so few mariners have ever escaped to tell the tale!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5434"/>Nothing else could account for the suddenness of the calm, coupled with the lowness of the barometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5435"/>We knew that when the vortex should pass, the gale would be renewed, as suddenly as it had ceased, and with increased fury, and that the frail little <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>&mdash;for indeed she looked frail and small, now, amid the giant seas that were rising in a confused mass around her, and threatening, every moment, to topple on board of her, with an avalanche of water that would bury her a <num value="100">hundred</num> fathoms deep&mdash;might be dashed in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> pieces in an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5436"/>I pulled out my watch, and noted the time of the occurrence of the calm, and causing <num value="1">one</num> of the cabin-doors to be unclosed, I sent an officer below to look at the barometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5437"/>He reported the height already mentioned&mdash;<num value="28.64">28.64</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5438"/>If the reader will cast his eye upon the diagram again&mdash;at figure <num value="2">No. 2</num>&mdash;he will see where we were at this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5439"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>'s</hi> head now lies to the south-east&mdash;she having <q direct="unspecified">come up</q> gradually to the wind, as it hauled&mdash;and she is in the south-eastern hemisphere of the vortex.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5440"/>The scene was the most remarkable I had ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5441"/>The ship, which had been pressed over, only a moment before, by the fury of the gale as described, had now righted, and the heavy storm staysail, which, notwithstanding its diminutive size, had required <num value="2">two</num> stout tackles to confine it to the deck, was now, for want of wind to keep it steady, jerking these tackles about as though it would snap them in pieces, as the ship rolled to and fro!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5442"/>The aspect of the heavens was appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5443"/>The clouds were writhing and twisting, like so many huge serpents engaged in combat, and hung so low, in the thin air of the vortex, as almost <pb id="p.476" n="476"/> to touch our mast-heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5444"/>The best description I can give of the sea, is that of a number of huge watery cones&mdash;for the waves seemed now in the diminished pressure of the atmosphere in the vortex to <hi rend="italics">jut up into the sky</hi>, and assume a conical shape&mdash; that were dancing an infernal reel, played by some necromancer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5445"/>They were not running in any given direction, there being no longer any wind to drive them, but were jostling each other, like drunken men in a crowd, and threatening, every moment, to topple, <num value="1">one</num> upon the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5446"/>With watch in hand I noticed the passage of the vortex.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5447"/>It was just <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure> in passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5448"/>The gale had left us, with the wind from the south-west; the ship, the moment she emerged from the vortex, took the wind from the north-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5449"/>We could see it coming upon the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5450"/>The disorderly seas were now no longer jostling each other; the infernal reel had ended; the cones had lowered their late rebellious heads, as they felt the renewed pressure of the atmosphere, and were being driven, like so many obedient slaves, before the raging blast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5451"/>The tops of the waves were literally cut off by the force of the wind, and dashed hundreds of yards, in blinding spray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5452"/>The wind now struck us <q direct="unspecified">butt and foremost,</q> throwing the ship over in an instant, as before, and threatening to jerk the little storm-sail from its bolt-ropes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5453"/>It was impossible to raise <num value="1">one</num>'s head above the rail, and difficult to breathe for a few seconds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5454"/>We could do nothing but cower under the weather bulwarks, and hold on to the belaying pins, or whatever other objects presented themselves, to prevent being dashed to leeward, or swept overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5455"/>The gale raged, now, precisely as long as it had done before we entered the vortex &mdash;<measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>&mdash;showing how accurately Nature had drawn her circle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5456"/>At the end of this time, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> found herself in position <num value="3">No. 3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5457"/>The reader will observe that she is still on the starboard tack, and that from east, she has brought her head around to nearly west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5458"/>The storm is upon the point of passing away from her. I now again sent an officer below, to inspect the barometer, and he reported <num value="29">29</num>. <num value="70">70</num>; the instrument having risen a little more than an inch in <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>! This, alone, is evidence of the violence of the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5459"/>During the <pb id="p.477" n="477"/> whole course of the storm, a good deal of rain had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5460"/>It is the rain which adds such fury to the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5461"/>These storms come to us, as has been said, from the tropics, and the winds, by which they are engendered, are highly charged with vapor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5462"/>In the course of taking up this vapor from the sea, the winds take up, along with it, a large quantity of latent heat, or heat whose presence is not indicated by the thermometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5463"/>As the raging cyclone is moving onward in its path, the winds begin to part with their burden&mdash;it begins to rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5464"/>The moment the vapor is condensed into rain, the latent heat, which was taken up with the vapor, is liberated, and the consequence is, the formation of a furnace in the sky, as it were, overhanging the raging storm, and travelling along with it. The more rain there falls, the more latent heat there escapes; the more latent heat there escapes, the hotter the furnace becomes; and the hotter the furnace, the more furiously the wind races around the circle, and rushes into the upper air to fill the vacuum, and restore the equilibrium.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5465"/>In <measure n="4.5hours" type="date">four hours and a half</measure>, from the commencement of the gale, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was left rolling, and tumbling about in the confused sea, which the gale had left behind it, with scarcely wind enough to fill the sails, which, by this time, we had gotten upon her, to keep her steady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5466"/>Little more remains to be said of the cyclone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5467"/>If the reader will take a last look at the diagram, he will see how it is, that the wind, which appears to him to change, has not changed in reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5468"/>The wind, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the last, is travelling around the circle, changing not at all. It is the passage of the circle over the ship&mdash;or over the observer upon the land&mdash;which causes it apparently to change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5469"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> lay still during the whole gale, not changing her position, perhaps, half a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5470"/>As the circle touched her, she took the wind from S. to S. S. E., and when it had passed over her, she had the wind at north-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5471"/>In the intermediate time, the wind had <hi rend="italics">apparently</hi> hauled <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and then to the other, of all the intermediate points of the compass, and yet it had not changed a hair's breadth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5472"/>The weather did not become fine, for several days after the gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5473"/>On the following night, it again became thick and cloudy, and the wind blew very fresh from the south-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5474"/><pb id="p.478" n="478"/> The sea, though it had somewhat subsided, was still very rough, and the night was so dark, that the officer of the deck could not see half the length of the ship in any direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5475"/>The south-west wind was a fair wind from the enemy's ports, to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and we kept a very bright look-out, to prevent ourselves from being run over, by some heavy ship of commerce, hurrying, with lightning speed, before wind and sea. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5484"/>We were lying to, as usual, when a large ship was descried, in the north-west, running in our direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5485"/>Though the wind was very fresh, she had her royals and foretopmast studding-sails set, and was, in consequence, running before the wind, with great speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5486"/>I shook the reefs out of my own topsails, and prepared to set the topgallant-sails if it should be necessary, and filled away, and moved toward the path of the stranger as she approached, with the <rs>English</rs> colors at my peak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5487"/>The fine, large ship, as she ran down to us, presented a beautiful picture&mdash;all the more beautiful because we knew her to be <persName n="Yankee,,,,," id="n0133.0036.00480.01197" reg="mostcommon:Yankee,nomatch:0"><surname>Yankee</surname></persName>, although she had not yet shown her colors.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5488"/>We had become now very expert in detecting the nationalities of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5489"/>I had with me a master's mate&mdash;Evans&mdash;who had a peculiar talent in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5490"/>He had been a pilot out of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and had sailed in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName></hi>, privateer, at the beginning of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5491"/>He afterward joined me at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5492"/>Whenever I had any doubt about the nationality of a ship, I always sent for <persName n="Evans,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0036.00480.01198" reg="mostcommon:Evans,William,E.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>, and putting my telescope in his hand, I would say to him, <q direct="unspecified">Look at that ship,</q> pointing in the given direction, <q direct="unspecified">and tell me to what nation she belongs.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5493"/>A glance of a minute or <num value="2">two</num> was <pb id="p.481" n="481"/> all he required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5494"/>Lowering his glass at the end of this time, he would say to me, <q direct="unspecified">She is a Yankee, sir,</q> or, <q direct="unspecified">She is not a Yankee,</q> as the case might be; and if she was not a Yankee, he would say, <q direct="unspecified">I think she is <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0133.0036.00481.01199" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>,</q> or <persName n="French,,,,," id="n0133.0036.00481.01200" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, or <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Dutch</placeName>, or whatever other nation to which he supposed her to belong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5495"/>He sometimes failed, of course, in assigning their proper nationality to neutrals, but his judgment seemed to amount to an instinct, with regard to the question, Yankee, or no Yankee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5496"/>When he pronounced a ship a Yankee, I was always certain of her. I never knew him to fail, in this particular, but once, and that can scarcely be said to have been a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5497"/>He once mistook a <placeName key="tgn,7013172" n="1.000 13" reg="saint john,new brunswick,canada,north and central america">St. John</placeName>'s, <placeName reg="New Brunswick" key="tgn,7005799">New Brunswick</placeName>-built ship, for an enemy; and the ships built in the <rs>British Colonies</rs>, on the <rs>Yankee</rs> border, are such counterparts of American ships, that it is very difficult to distinguish <num value="1">one</num> from the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5498"/>The ship which was now running down for us was, as I have said, a picture, with her masts yielding and swaying to a cloud of sail, her tapering poles shooting skyward, even above her royals, and her well-turned, <hi rend="italics">flaring</hi> bows&mdash;the latter a distinctive feature of New York-built ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5499"/>She came on, rolling gracefully to the sea, and with the largest kind of a <q direct="unspecified">bone in her mouth.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5500"/>She must have suspected something, from our very equivocal attitude in such weather, and in such a place; but she made no change in her course, and was soon under our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5501"/>A blank cartridge brought her to the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5502"/>If the scene was beautiful before, it was still more so now. If she had been a ship of war, full of men, and with hands stationed at sheets, halliards, and braces, she could not have shortened sail much more rapidly, or have rounded more promptly and gracefully to the wind, with her main topsail aback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5503"/>Her cloud of canvas seemed to shrivel and disappear, as though it had been a scroll rolled up by an invisible hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5504"/>It is true, nothing had been furled, and her light sails were all flying in the wind, confined to the yards only by their clew-lines, but the ship lay as snugly and conveniently for boarding, as I could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5505"/>I frequently had occasion, during my cruises, to admire the seamanship of my enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5506"/>The Yankee is certainly a remarkable specimen of the <hi rend="italics">genus homo</hi>. He is at once a duck, and a chicken, and takes to the water, <pb id="p.482" n="482"/> or the land, with equal facility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5509"/>In the development of material wealth he is unsurpassed, and perhaps this is his mission on this new continent of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5510"/>But he is like the beaver, he works from instinct, and is so avid of gain, that he has <hi rend="italics">no time to enjoy the wealth he produces</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5513"/>In fact, from this time onward, I rarely got hold of an enemy's ship, whose cargo was not certificated all over&mdash;oaths for this purpose being apparently as cheap, as the much-derided custom-house oaths, that every ship-master is expected to take, without the least regard to the state of the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5514"/>Upon examination of these certificates, I pronounced them fraudulent, and burned the ship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5515"/>As the burning of this vessel, with her cargo nicely <q direct="unspecified">covered,</q> as the shippers had hoped, with British Consular seals and certificates, seemed to warm up the <rs>Northern</rs> press, and cause it to hurl fresh denunciations of <q direct="unspecified">piracy</q> against me, I will detain the reader, a moment, from the thread of my narrative, to look a little into the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5617"/>These rotary winds were circles of greater or less diameter, obeying the laws of storms, and travelling along in the direction of the current, or about north-east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5618"/>There was an interval of only a few hours between them, the barometer rising regularly as <num value="1">one</num> circle or whirl departed, and falling as the next approached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5619"/>I was much struck with the exceeding regularity of the recurrence of this phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5623"/>We gave chase at once, but as the schooner was to windward of us, a considerable distance, the chase promised to be long, without the aid of steam, and this, for reasons already explained, I was averse to using, though we kept, at all times, banked fires in the furnaces, and warm water in the boilers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5624"/>The stranger hugged his wind very closely, this being always the best point of sailing with schooners; but this was also the best point of sailing with the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5627"/>Elevating the gun some <num value="10">ten</num> degrees, we let fly the bolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5628"/>It threw up the water in a beautiful jet, within less than half a mile of her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5629"/>It was enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5633"/>It was amusing to see how these merchants clung to the <rs>British</rs> seal, and appealed to the <rs>British</rs> power, when their grain sacks were in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5634"/>But it was all to no purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5635"/>I would have respected scrupulously any <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> neutral ownership of property, but I knew all these certificates to be fraudulent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5636"/>Fraudulent as the transactions were, however, some of the shippers might have imposed upon me, if they had only known how to prepare their vouchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5637"/>But they were such bunglers, that they committed the most glaring mistakes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5638"/>The New York merchant is a pretty sharp fellow, in the matter of shaving paper, getting up false invoices, and <q direct="unspecified">doing</q> the custom-house; but the laws of nations, which had had little connection, heretofore, <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> with the debit and credit side of his ledger, rather muddled his brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Crenshaw, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,2000020">Crenshaw</placeName>'s</hi> certificates were precisely like so many others I had, by this time, overhauled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>They simply stated, that the cargo belonged to <q direct="unspecified">subjects of her Britannic Majesty,</q> without naming them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/>To quote the certificates literally, they were in these terms: <q direct="unspecified">The goods specified, in the annexed bills of lading, were shipped on board the <term type="ship">schooner</term> <rs type="ship">Crenshaw</rs>, for, and on account of subjects of her Britannic Majesty, and the said goods are wholly, and <hi rend="italics">bonafide</hi>, the property of <name>British</name> subjects.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>And when I came to look at the bills of lading, I found that the property was consigned <hi rend="italics">to the order of the shippers</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>For aught that appeared from the certificates, the <q direct="unspecified">subjects</q> were all resident in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>The men were, however, <pb id="p.493" n="493"/> cheerful and obedient, were as much excited as ever by the chase and the capture, and were fast becoming a well-disciplined crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5755"/>It comes from heat, and as the sun is the father of heat, he is the father of the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5756"/>Let us suppose the earth, and atmosphere both to be created, but not yet the sun. The atmosphere, being of equal temperature throughout the earth, would be in equilibrium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5757"/>It could not move in any direction, and there would not be the slightest breeze to fan the brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5758"/>Now let us suppose the sun to be called into existence, and to begin to dart forth his rays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5759"/>If he heated the earth, and the atmosphere in all parts alike, whilst there would be a swelling of the atmosphere into greater bulk, there would still be no motion which we could call wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5760"/>But the earth being placed in an elliptical orbit, and made to revolve around the sun, with its axis inclined to the plane in which it revolves, now approaching, and now receding from the sun, and now having the sun in <num value="1">one</num> hemisphere, and now in another, the atmosphere is not only heated differently, in different parts of the earth, but at different seasons of the year; and thus the winds are engendered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5761"/>Let us imagine this heating process to be going on for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5762"/>How we should be astonished?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5763"/>The atmosphere having hitherto had no motion, in our experience, we should <pb id="p.501" n="501"/> have conceived it as immovable as the hills, and would be quite as much astonished to see it putting itself in motion, as to see the hills running away from us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5764"/>Evidently from the <name>north</name>, and <name>south</name> poles toward the equator, because we know that the intertropical portions of the earth are more heated, than the extratropical portions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5765"/>Thus far, we have not given the earth any diurnal motion around its axis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5766"/>Let us give it this motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5767"/>It is revolving now from west to east, at the rate of <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> in a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5768"/>If the atmosphere had been perfectly still when this motion was given to the earth, as we have supposed it to have been before the creation of the sun, the consequence would be a breeze directly from the east, blowing with different degrees of strength, as it was nearer to, or further from the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5769"/>For it is obviously the same thing whether the atmosphere stands still, and the earth revolves, or whether the earth stands still, and the atmosphere moves.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5772"/>But the atmosphere was not still, when we gave the diurnal motion to the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5773"/>There was already a breeze blowing, as we have seen, from the <name>north</name>, and <name>south</name> poles toward the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5774"/>We have thus generated <num value="2">two</num> winds&mdash;a north wind and an east wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5775"/>But these <num value="2">two</num> winds cannot blow in the same place at the same time; and the result will be a wind compounded of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5776"/>Thus in the northern hemisphere <pb id="p.502" n="502"/> we Shall have a north-east wind, and in the southern hemisphere we shall have a south east-wind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5777"/>These are the <num value="2">two</num> trade-winds, enclosed by the <num value="3">three</num> calmbelts which have been described to the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5778"/>The <num value="3">three</num> arrows on the preceding page will illustrate the manner in which the north-east trade-wind is formed by the north wind and the east wind, which our theory puts in motion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5779"/>Why it is that the trade-winds do not extend all the way from the poles to the equator, but take their rise in about the <num value="30" type="ordinal">thirtieth</num> parallel of latitude, <name>north</name> and <name>south</name>, we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5780"/>The theory would seem to demand that they should spring up at the poles, and blow continuously to the equator; in which case we should have but <num value="2">two</num> systems of winds covering the entire surface of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5781"/>This non-conformity of the winds of the extra-tropical regions to our theory, does not destroy it, however, but brings into the meteorological problem other and beautiful features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5782"/>Having put the winds in motion, our next business is to follow them, and see what <q direct="unspecified">circuits</q> they travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5783"/>The quantity of atmosphere carried to the equator by the north-<name>east</name> and <name>south</name>-east trade-winds, must find its way back whence it came, in some mode or other; otherwise, we should soon have all the atmosphere drawn away from the poles, and piled up at the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>We can easily conceive this, if we liken the atmosphere to fleeces of wool, and suppose an invisible hand to be constantly drawing away the fleeces from the poles, and piling them up at the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>But how to get it back is the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>It cannot go back on the surface of the earth, within the tropics, for there is a constant surface current here toward the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> other way, of course, in which it can go back, and that is, as an upper current, running counter to the surface current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5788"/>We may assume, indeed, we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> assume, that there are <num value="2">two</num> upper currents of air, setting out from the equator, and travelling, <num value="1">one</num> of them to the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> degree of north latitude, and the other to the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> degree of south latitude.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5789"/>What becomes of these <num value="2">two</num> upper currents, when they reach these parallels of latitude, is not quite so certain; but there is good reason for believing that they now descend, become surface currents, and continue their journey on to the <pb id="p.503" n="503"/> poles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5790"/>It is further supposed that, when they reach the poles, they <q direct="unspecified">whirl about</q> them, ascend, become upper currents again, and start back to the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> parallel; and that, when they have returned to this parallel, they descend, become a surface current again&mdash;in other words, the trade&mdash;wind-and proceed to the equator as before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5791"/>But there is another, and more beautiful problem still, connected with these winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5792"/>It is their crossing each other at the equator, of which the proofs are so abundant, that there can be but little doubt concerning it. And yet the proposition, looked at apart from the proofs, is a very startling <num value="1">one</num>. <num value="1">One</num> would think that when the <num value="2">two</num> winds met at the equator, there would be a general intermingling, and confounding of particles, and that when they ascended to form the upper currents, of which I have spoken, the northern particle would be <figure id="fig.503"> 
<head></head></figure> <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> as likely to turn back to the north, as to cross the equator and go South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5793"/>The preceding figure will illustrate the crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5794"/>Let a represent the equator, the arrows near the surface of the circle the <num value="2">two</num> trade-winds, and the <num value="2">two</num> cross arrows, <num value="2">two</num> particles of wind in the act of crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5795"/>The difficulty is to conceive how these particles should cross, without mixing with each other, and losing their identity; or why they should not turn back, as well as continue their course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5796"/>What law of nature is it, that makes the particles of atmosphere which have come from the north pole, so separate and distinct from those which have come from the <rs>South</rs> pole, as to prevent the <num value="2">two</num> from fusing, and becoming <num value="1">one</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5797"/>is it because the <num value="2">two</num> particles, as they have gyrated around their respective poles, have received a repulsive polarity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5798"/>whatever may be the reason, there can be no doubt, as remarked, that they do actually cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5799"/><num value="1">One</num> strong proof of their crossing is, that we cannot conceive, otherwise, how the great atmospheric machine could perform its office of distributing rain over the earth in due proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>The reader will recollect that there is from a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, more land than water, in the northern hemisphere, and that there is from a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> more water than land in the southern hemisphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5801"/>The consequence of this unequal distribution of land and water in the <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres is, that the northern hemisphere requires more rain than the southern, in the proportion in which it has more land to be rained upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/>Now it is these mysterious trade-winds, of which we have been speaking, that are the water-carriers of the <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5803"/>These winds, on their way to the equator, generally reach the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> parallel as dry winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>These dry winds, sweeping over the tropical seas, take up, in the shape of vapor, the water with which, in due time, they are to fertilize the fields of the farmer, and make the rose blossom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>The quantity which they take up is in proportion to the sea-surface, or evaporating surface, they have respectively passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>Now, if we will examine the jars of these water-carriers, when they reach the equator, we shall find that the northern jars are not nearly so full as the southern jars; the reason being, that the northern winds have passed over less evaporating surface.

<p>now, if the <num value="2">two</num> systems of winds, with their jars thus filled, were to turn back to their respective hemispheres, and pour down upon them their water, in the shape of rain, the consequence would be, as the reader sees, that we should have less rain in the northern hemisphere, than they would have in the southern hemisphere; whereas, we require more, having more land to be watered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/>The atmospheric machine would thus be at fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>But the all-wise and beneficent ruler of the universe, makes nothing faulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>We know from the evidence of that silent witness, the rain-gauge, that more water falls in the northern hemisphere, than in the southern; in other words, that the more heavily laden of those jars which we examined, a moment ago, at the equator, have come to us, instead of returning to the <rs>South</rs>; the less heavily laden jars going South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/>The crossing of the winds thus satisfies our theory, and nothing else can; which is, of course, the most conclusive of all proofs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5812"/>but we have other proofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>For a number of years past, as the <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East India</placeName> ships would be returning home from their voyages, they would report a curious phenomenon to have befallen them, as they passed the parallel of the <rs type="place">Cape de Verde</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/>This was the falling, or rather silting down upon their decks and rigging, of a brick-dust or cinnamon-colored powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>This dust, which when rubbed between the thumb and forefinger would be impalpable, would sometimes nearly cover the entire deck and rigging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>The ships would be hundreds of miles away from the land, and where could this dust come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5817"/>the fact puzzled the philosophers, but having been reported so often, it ceased to attract attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5818"/>Still it was a fact, and was laid away carefully in the archives of philosophy for future use. Years passed away, and the great traveller and philosopher, <persName n="Humboldt,,,,," id="n0133.0037.00505.01285" reg="mostcommon:Humboldt,nomatch:0"><surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>, arose to instruct and delight mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5819"/>He travelled extensively in <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>; and, among other places, visited the lower <placeName reg="Orinoco Valley">valley of the Orinoco</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5820"/>He happened there in the dry season, and gives a graphic account of the wild and weird spectacle of desolation which met his eye in that season of universal drought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5821"/>all annual vegetation lay dead and desiccated on the immense pampas or plains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5822"/>The earth was cracked open, gaping, <pb id="p.506" n="506"/> as it were, for rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5823"/>The wild cattle were roaming about in herds, bellowing for their accustomed food and water; many of them perishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5824"/>Even the insect world, so numerous and vivacious in all southern climates, had perished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5825"/>Their tiny little organisms lay in heaps, fast disintegrating and being reduced to powder, by the scorching and baking rays of a perpendicular sun, between which and the parched earth, not so much as a speck of cloud appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5826"/>The philosopher examined a number of these little organisms with his microscope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5827"/>They were peculiar to the region in which he found them, and he was struck with the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5828"/>There was another phenomenon which he observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5829"/>A number of little whirlwinds were playing their pranks about the arid waste, sporting, as it were, with dead nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5830"/>These little whirlwinds, as they travelled hither and thither, would draw up into their vortices, and toss high into the upper air, the impalpable dust that lay everywhere, and which was composed, in great measure, of the decomposed and decomposing organisms of which I have spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>The atmosphere, at times, when filled with this dust, would assume a yellowish, or pale straw-colored hue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>the reader probably, by this time, sees my design of connecting the dusty remains, described by <persName n="Humboldt,,,,," id="n0133.0037.00506.01286" reg="mostcommon:Humboldt,nomatch:0"><surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>, with the rain dust reported by the mariners to have fallen on the decks and rigging of their ships, in the neighborhood of the <rs type="place">Cape de Verde</rs> islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>But the <q direct="unspecified">rain-dust</q> was of brick-dust, or cinnamon color, when collected by the masters of the ships, as specimens and the heavens, when filled with the dust thrown up by the whirlwinds, as described by <persName n="Humboldt,,,,," id="n0133.0037.00506.01287" reg="mostcommon:Humboldt,nomatch:0"><surname>Humboldt</surname></persName>, appeared to him to be of a straw color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5834"/>Here is a discrepancy to be rec onciled, and we must call in the aid of another philosopher, <persName n="Maury,Captain,M.,F.,," id="n0133.0037.00506.01288" reg="expanded:Maury,Matthew,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName>, late <rs type="role" reg="Superintendent">Superintendent</rs> of the <rs>National Observatory</rs>, at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, before alluded to in these pages, and to whom I am indebted for many of the facts here quoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5836"/></p> 
<p>there remains but another link in the chain of evidence, to render it complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5837"/>It remains to be shown how the whirlwind dust, of the valley of the lower <rs>Orinoco</rs>, can be identified with the rain-dust of the <rs type="place">Cape de Verde</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5838"/><persName n="Ehrenberg,,,,," id="n0133.0037.00507.01290" reg="mostcommon:Ehrenberg,nomatch:0"><surname>Ehrenberg</surname></persName>, a German philosopher, has done this, in our day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5839"/>These facts correspond entirely with our theory of the crossing of the trade-winds at the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5840"/>The reader has been with us near the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1128153" n="1.000 10" reg="Orinoco,South America">Orinoco</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5841"/>This great river disembogues near the island of <placeName key="tgn,7004789" n="1.000 2" reg="trinidad">Trinidad</placeName>, which we visited in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName></hi>, in about the latitude of <num value="9">9</num>&deg; N. The vernal equinox is the dry season here, and at this season, the north-east trade-wind is quite fresh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5842"/>Running counter to this wind, in the upper atmosphere, there is, according to our theory, a strong South-west wind blowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5843"/>Now, if the reader will inspect a map, he will find that a South-west wind, starting from the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,1128153" n="1.000 10" reg="Orinoco,South America">Orinoco</placeName>, will blow over the <rs type="place">Cape de Verde</rs> islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5844"/>The rest is plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5845"/>The whirlwind-dust is tossed high enough into the upper atmosphere, to be taken in charge by the counter South-west wind, is carried to the <rs type="place">Cape de Verde</rs>, and there silted down upon the decks and rigging of the passing ships, as gently as so many snowflakes, becoming the rain-dust which so long puzzled the philosophers!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5846"/>we have reasoned, hitherto, on the supposition, that the <num value="3">three</num> calm-belts, <num value="1">one</num> of which the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> is now passing, and the <num value="2">two</num> systems of trade-winds which they enclose, are stationary within certain limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5847"/>But this is not so; the whole system of belts and winds is moved <name>north</name> and <name>South</name>, as the sun passes now into <num value="1">one</num> hemisphere, and now into another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5848"/>The calm-belt of Cancer is not always in the latitude of <num value="30">30</num>&deg; N.; nor is the calm-belt of the equator always at the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5850"/>The reason is, that the sun, on that day, was in the southern hemisphere, well advanced toward his extreme limit in that hemisphere, and that he had dragged, as it were, the whole system of belts and winds after him. The figures below will make this idea plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5851"/>Let the broad, dark lines in the circles represent the system of belts and winds, all in <num value="1">one</num>; and in circle a let the sun be in the northern hemisphere, and in circle B let him be in the southern.

<p>The reader will see, how the sun, having hitched this system of belts and winds to his chariot wheels, as it were, has drawn it after him.

This was immediately done, without demur in any instance, and the culprit was ironed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5892"/>In this way I got as many as <num value="20">twenty</num> disorderly fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5893"/>These drunken men, the moment the attempt was made to arrest them, began to show fight, and to be abusive in their language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5894"/>They were, however, soon overpowered, and rendered harmless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5895"/>In this way I passed forward and aft, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, eying the men as I passed, to be certain that I had gotten hold of all the rioters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5896"/>When I had done this, I directed the mutineers to be taken to the gangway, and calling <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the most active of the quartermasters, I made them provide themselves with draw-buckets, and commencing with the most noisy and drunken of the culprits, I ordered them to dash buckets of water over them in quick succession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5897"/>The punishment was so evidently novel to the recipients, that they were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> disposed to deride it. With drunken gravity they would laugh and swear by turns, and tell the <q direct="unspecified">bloody quartermasters</q> to <q direct="unspecified">come on with their water, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> were not afraid of it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5898"/>But I was quite sure of my remedy, for I had tried it before; and as the drunken fellows would call for more water, in contempt and derision, I gratified them, and caused bucketsful to be dashed on them with such rapidity, that pretty soon they found it difficult to catch their breath, in the intervals between the showers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5899"/>The more they would struggle and gasp for breath, the more rapidly the buckets would be emptied upon them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5900"/>The effect was almost electric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5901"/>The maudlin fellows, somewhat sobered by the repeated shocks of the cold water, began now to swear less vociferously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5902"/>In fact, they had no voice to swear with, for it was as much as they could do, to breathe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5903"/>They no longer <q direct="unspecified">bloodied</q> the quartermasters, or called for more water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5904"/>Being reduced thus to silence, and still the water <pb id="p.513" n="513"/> descending upon them as rapidly as ever, with half-sobered brain, and frames shivering with the cold, they would now become seriously alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5905"/>Did the captain mean to drown them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5906"/>Was this the way he designed to punish them for mutiny, instead of hanging them at the yard-arm?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5907"/>They now turned to me, and begged me, for <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake, to spare them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5908"/>If I would only let them go this time, I should never have cause to complain of them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5909"/>I held off a little while, as if inexorable to their prayers and entreaties, the better to impress upon them the lesson I was teaching them, and then ordered them to be released.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5910"/>When their irons were taken off, they were sober enough to go below to their hammocks, without another word, and <q direct="unspecified">turn in</q> like good boys!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5911"/>It took me some time to get through with this operation, for I had the delinquents&mdash;about a dozen of the most noisy&mdash;soused <num value="1">one</num> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5912"/>The officers and crew were all this while&mdash;some <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>&mdash;standing at their guns, at quarters, and I could, now and then, overhear quite an audible titter from some of the sober men, as the drunken ones who were undergoing the shower-bath would now defy my authority, and now beg for mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5942"/>As we ran in to this anchorage, which I remembered well from having visited it once in a ship of war of the old service, I was surprised to see a Yankee whaling schooner at anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5978"/>I had learned from captured Northern papers, that he was fitting out at <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and New York, a large expedition, to consist of not less than <num value="30000">30,000</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5979"/>To transport such an army, a large number of transport-ships would be required.

<p>As there were but <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> of water on the <rs>Galveston</rs> bar, very few of these transport-ships would be able to enter the harbor; the great mass of them, numbering, perhaps, a <num value="100">hundred</num> and more, would be obliged to anchor, pell-mell, in the open sea. Much disorder, and confusion would necessarily attend the landing of so many troops, encumbered by horses, artillery, baggage-wagons, and stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5982"/>My design was to surprise this fleet by a night-attack, and if possible destroy it, or at least greatly cripple it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5983"/>It was to be presumed, of course, that some of the enemy's gun-boats would accompany the expedition, but I hoped to be able to fall so unexpectedly upon their convoy, as to find them off their guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6100"/>There was not only no ship-ofwar of the enemy to be seen, but none of the neutrals that I had spoken, had fallen in with any. We had, therefore, a clear sea before us, for carrying out our design of waylaying a California steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6101"/>In the afternoon, we stretched over to the east end of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, and took our station in <q direct="unspecified">watch and wait.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6102"/></p> 
<p>On the same night, we chased and overhauled a French bark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6103"/>The sea was smooth, and a bright moon shining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6104"/>The chase paid no attention to our blank cartridge, though we were close on board of her, and stood a shot before she would come to the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6105"/>As we threw this purposely between her masts, and pretty close over the heads of her people, she came to the conclusion that it would not be safe to trifle longer, and rounded to and backed her main yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6106"/>When asked by the boardingofficer, why he did not heave to, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal, the master replied naively that he was a Frenchman, and at war with nobody!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6107"/>Philosophical Frenchman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6108"/><pb id="p.529" n="529"/></p> 
<p>We had accurate time-tables of the arrivals and departures of the <rs>California</rs> steamers, in the files of the New York papers, that we had captured, and by these tables, the homeward-bound steamer would not be due for a few days yet. We spent this interval in lying off and on the east end of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, under easy sail, chasing more or less during the day, but without success, all the vessels overhauled being neutrals, and closing in with <placeName reg="Cape Maize">Cape Maize</placeName> during the night, and holding on to its very brilliant light until morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6109"/>The weather was clear, and the moon near her full, so that I had almost as good a view of the passage by night as by day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6110"/>On the <dateStruct value="-12-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, a prize ran into our arms, without the necessity of a chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6111"/>It was a Baltimore schooner called the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi>, old, and of little value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6112"/>She had, besides, a neutral cargo, properly documented, for a small town called <placeName reg="Port Maria,Saint Mary,Middlesex,Jamaica,North and Central America" key="tgn,1016884">Port Maria</placeName>, on the north side of <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6113"/>I transferred the prisoners of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Cooke,,,,," id="n0133.0038.00529.01340" reg="nearbymention:Cooke,Parker,,,"><surname>Cooke</surname></persName></hi> to her, and released her on ransom-bond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6114"/>My original orders were not to capture <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> vessels, but that good old State had long since ceased to occupy the category in which our Congress, and the <rs>Executive</rs> had placed her. She was now ranged under the enemy's flag, and I could make no discrimination in her favor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6115"/>On the next day the <rs>California</rs> steamer was due, and a very bright lookout was kept; a number of the young officers volunteering their services for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6116"/>In the transparent atmosphere of this delightful climate, we could see to great distances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6117"/>The west end of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, about <placeName reg="Cape Tiburon">Cape Tiburon</placeName>, was visible, though distant <measure n="90miles" type="distance">ninety miles</measure>. But not so much as a smoke was seen during the entire day, and the sun went down upon disappointed hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6118"/>The next day was <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and the holy-stones had been busy over my head during all the morning watch, putting the decks in order for muster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6119"/>I had turned out, and dressed, and swept the entire horizon with my telescope, without seeing anything to encourage me. The crew had breakfasted, and the word, <q direct="unspecified">All hands clean yourselves, in white frocks and trousers, for muster!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6120"/>had been growled out by the boatswain, and echoed by his mates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6121"/>The decks were encumbered with clothes-bags, and <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0038.00529.01341" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> was arraying himself as directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6122"/>I had gone down to my own breakfast, and was <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> enjoying <num value="1">one</num> of Bartelli's cups of good coffee, hopeless for that day of my <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> steamer, and my <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6123"/>Suddenly the prolonged cry of <q direct="unspecified">S-a-i-l-h-o!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6124"/>came ringing, in a clear musical voice, from aloft; the look-out having at length descried a steamer, and being anxious to impart the intelligence in as emphatic a manner as possible, to the startled listeners on the deck below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6125"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Where-away?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6126"/>of the officer of the deck, shouted through his trumpet, followed, and in a moment more came the rejoinder, <q direct="unspecified">Broad on the port bow, sir!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6127"/><q direct="unspecified">What does she look like?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6128"/>again inquired the officer of the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6129"/><q direct="unspecified">She is a large steamer, brig-rigged, sir!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6130"/>was the reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6131"/>An officer now came below to announce to me what I had already heard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6132"/>Here was a steamer at last, but unfortunately she was not in the right direction, being in the north-west instead of the southeast&mdash;the latter being the direction in which the <rs>California</rs> steamer should appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6133"/>All was excitement now on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6134"/>The engineers and firemen were set at work, in great haste, to get up their steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6135"/>The sailors were hurried with their <q direct="unspecified">cleaning,</q> and the bags stowed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6136"/><q direct="unspecified">All hands work ship!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6137"/>being called, the first lieutenant took the trumpet, and furled the sails, making a <q direct="unspecified">snug roll &mdash; up of it,</q> so that they might hold as little wind as possible, and lowered the propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6138"/>In <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> we were ready for the chase, with very thing snug <q direct="unspecified">alow and aloft,</q> and with the steam hissing from the gauge-cocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6139"/>The strange steamer came up very rapidly, and we scrutinized her anxiously to see whether she was a ship of war, or a packet-ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6140"/>She showed too much hull out of the water to be a ship of war, and yet we could not be sure, as the enemy had commissioned a great many packetsteamers, and put heavy armaments on board of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6141"/>When she was within <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of us, we showed her the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, and she responded in a few minutes, by hoisting the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6142"/>Like ourselves, she had her sails furled, and was carrying a very large <q direct="unspecified">bone in her mouth</q> under steam alone.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6143"/>We could now see that she was fast, and from the absence of guns at her sides, a packet-ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6144"/>I now put my ship in motion, with a view to lay her across the stranger's path, as <pb id="p.531" n="531"/> though I would speak her. But I missed doing this by about a couple of ship's lengths, the stranger passing just ahead of me. A beautiful spectacle presented itself as I passed under the stern of that monster steamship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6145"/>The weather was charming, there being a bright, clear sky, with only a few fleecy tradeclouds passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6146"/>There was just enough of the balmiest and gentlest of winds, to ruffle, without roughening the surface of the sea. The islands of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>, <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Jamaica" key="tgn,7005556">Jamaica</placeName>&mdash; the <num value="2">two</num> latter, in the blue and hazy distance, and the former robed in the gorgeous green known only to the tropics&mdash;were in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6147"/>The great packet-steamer had all her awnings set, and under these awnings, on the upper deck, was a crowd of passengers, male and female.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6148"/>Mixed with the male passengers were several officers in uniform, and on the forward deck, there were groups of soldiers to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6149"/>This crowd presented a charming picture, especially the ladies, most of whom were gayly dressed, with the streamers from their bonnets, their veils, and their waste ribbons flirting with the morning breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6150"/>We were sufficiently close to see the expression of their countenances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6151"/>Many of them were viewing us with <rs n="opera glass" type="product">opera glasses</rs>, evidently admiring the beautiful proportions, fine trim, and general comeliness of <num value="1">one</num> of their own gun-boats &mdash;for the reader will recollect, we were wearing still the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6152"/>As I passed the wake of the steamer, I wheeled in pursuit, fired a blank cartridge, and hauling down the <rs>Federal</rs>, threw the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6153"/>It was amusing to witness the panic which ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6154"/>If that old buccaneer, Blue <persName n="Beard,,,,," id="n0133.0038.00531.01342" reg="mostcommon:Beard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beard</surname></persName>, himself, had appeared, the consternation could not have been greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6155"/>The ladies screamed&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> of those delightful, dramatic screams, half fear, half acting, which can only ascend from female voices&mdash;and scampered off the deck in a trice; the men running after them, and making quite as good, if not better time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6156"/>The effect of my gun, and change of flags on the steamer herself, seemed to be scarcely less electric.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6157"/>She had no intention, whatever, of obeying my command to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6158"/>On the contrary, I could see from the increased impetus with which she sprang forward, and the dense volumes of black smoke that now came rushing, and whirling from her <pb id="p.532" n="532"/> smoke-stack, that she was making every possible effort to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6159"/>She had gotten a little the start of me, as I was wheeling to pursue her, and might be now, some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards distant</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6160"/>The reader has been on the race-course, and seen <num value="2">two</num> fleet horses, with necks and tails straightened, and running about <q direct="unspecified">neck and neck.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6161"/>This will give him a pretty good idea of the race which is now going on. We had not stretched a mile, when it became quite evident that the stranger had the heels of me, and that, if I would capture her, I must resort to force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6162"/>I ordered my <q direct="unspecified">persuader,</q> as the sailors called my rifled bow-gun, to be cleared away, and sent orders to the officer, to take aim at the fugitive's foremast, being careful to throw his shot high enough above the deck not to take life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6163"/>When the gun was ready to be fired, I yawed the ship a little, though the effect of this was to lose ground, to enable the officer the better, to take his aim. A flash, a curl of white smoke, and a flying off of large pieces of timber from the steamer's mast, were simultaneous occurrences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6164"/>It was sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6165"/>The mast had not been cut quite away, but enough had been done to satisfy the master of the steamer that he was entirely within our power, and that prudence would be the better part of valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6166"/>In a moment after, we could see a perceptible diminution in the motion of the <q direct="unspecified">walking-beam,</q> and pretty soon the great wheels of the steamer ceased to revolve, and she lay motionless on the water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6167"/>We <q direct="unspecified">slowed down</q> our own engine, and began to blow off steam at once, and ranging up alongside of the prize, sent a boat on board of her. It was thus we captured the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Ariel</rs>, instead of going to muster, on <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="1862-12-7"><day reg="7">7th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6168"/>But Fortune, after all, had played us a scurvy trick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6169"/>The <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi> was indeed a California steamer, but instead of being a homeward-bound steamer, with a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars in gold, in her safe, I had captured an outward-bound steamer, with <num value="500">five hundred</num> women and children on board!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6170"/>This was an elephant I had not bargained for, and I was seriously embarrassed to know what to do with it. I could not take her into any neutral port, even for landing the passengers, as this was forbidden, by those unfriendly orders in council I have more than once <pb id="p.533" n="533"/> spoken of, and I had no room for the passengers on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. The most that I could hope to do, was to capture some less valuable prize, within the next few days, turn the passengers of the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi> on board of her, and destroy the steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6171"/>Our capture, however, was not without useful results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6172"/>The officers and soldiers mentioned as being on board of her, were a battalion of marines, going out to the <rs>Pacific</rs>, to supply the enemy's ships of war on that station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6173"/>There were also some naval officers on board, for the same purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6174"/>These were all <hi rend="italics">paroled</hi>, and deprived of their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6175"/>The rank and file numbered <num value="140">140</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6176"/>When my boarding-officer returned, he reported to me that there was a great state of alarm among the passengers on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6177"/>They had been reading the accounts which a malicious, and mendacious Northern press had been giving of us, and took us to be no better than the <q direct="unspecified">plunderers,</q> and <q direct="unspecified">robbers</q> we had been represented to be. The women, in particular, he said, were, many of them, in hysterics, and apprehensive of the worst consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6178"/>I had very little sympathy for the terrors of the males, but the tear of a woman has always unmanned me. And as I knew something of the weakness of the sex, as well as its fears, I resorted to the following stratagem to calm the dear creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6179"/>I sent for my handsomest young lieutenant&mdash;and I had some very handsome young fellows on board the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>&mdash;</hi>and when he had come to me, I told him to go below, and array himself in his newest and handsomest uniform, buckle on the best sword there was in the wardroom, ask of Bartelli the loan of my brightest sword-knot, and come up to me for his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6180"/>Sailors are rapid dressers, and in a few minutes my lieutenant was again by my side, looking as bewitching as I could possibly desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6181"/>I gave him my own boat, a beautiful gig, that had been newly painted, and which my coxswain, who was a bit of a sea-dandy, had furnished with scarlet cushions, and fancy yoke and steering ropes, and directed him to go on board the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi>, and coax the ladies out of their hysterics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6182"/><q direct="unspecified">Oh! I'll be sure to do that, sir,</q> said he, with a charming air of coxcombry, <q direct="unspecified">I never knew a fair creature who could resist me more than <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6183"/>As he shoved off from the side, in my beautiful little <pb id="p.534" n="534"/> cockle-shell of a boat, with its fine-looking, lithe and active oarsmen, bending with the strength of athletes to their ashen blades, I could but pause a moment, myself, in admiration of the picture.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6184"/>A few strokes of his oars put him alongside of the steamer, and asking to be shown to the ladies' cabin, he entered the scene of dismay and confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6185"/>So many were the signs of distress, and so numerous the wailers, that he was abashed, for a moment, as he afterward told me, with all his assurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6186"/>But summoning courage, he spoke to them about as follows:&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">Ladies!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6187"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> has heard of your distress, and sent me on board to calm your fears, by assuring you, that you have fallen into the hands of Southern gentlemen, under whose protection you are entirely safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6188"/>We are by no means the ruffians and outlaws, that we have been represented by your people, and you have nothing whatever to fear.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6189"/>The sobs ceased as he proceeded, but they eyed him askance for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6190"/>As he advanced in their midst, however, they took a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and more favorable glance at him. A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> glance begat <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, more favorable still, and when he entered into conversation with some of the ladies nearest him&mdash;picking out the youngest and prettiest, as the rogue admitted&mdash;he found no reluctance on their part to answer him. In short, he was fast becoming a favorite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6191"/>The ice being once broken, a perfect avalanche of loveliness soon surrounded him, the eyes of the fair creatures looking all the brighter for the tears that had recently dimmed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6192"/>Presently a young lady, stepping up to him, took hold of <num value="1">one</num> of the bright buttons that were glittering on the breast of his coat, and asked him if he would not permit her to cut it off, as a memento of her adventure with the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. He assented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6193"/>A pair of scissors was produced, and away went the button I This emboldened another lady to make the same request, and away went another button; and so the process went on, until when I got my handsome lieutenant back, he was like a plucked peacock&mdash;he had scarcely a button to his coat!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6194"/>There were no more Hebes drowned in tears, on board the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6195"/>But what struck my young officer as very singular was the deportment of the male passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6196"/>Some of these seemed to be overhauling their trunks in a great hurry, as though there <pb id="p.535" n="535"/> were valuables in them, which they were anxious to secrete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6197"/>Their watches, too, had disappeared from some of their vestpockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6198"/><q direct="unspecified">I verily believe,</q> said he, as he was giving me an account of the manner in which he performed his mission, <q direct="unspecified">that these fellows think we are no better than the <rs>Northern</rs> thieves, who are burning dwelling-houses, and robbing our women and children in the <rs>South</rs>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6199"/></p> 
<p>I take pleasure in contrasting, in these memoirs, the conduct of my officers and crew, during the late war, in the uniform respect which they paid to the laws of war, and the dictates of humanity, with that of some of the generals and colonels of the <rs>Federal Army</rs>, who debased our common nature, and disgraced the uniforms they wore by the brutality and pilferings I have described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6200"/>There were <num value="500">500</num> passengers on board the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi>. It is fair to presume, that each passenger had with him a purse, of from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>. Under the laws of war, all this money would have been good prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6201"/>But not <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> of it was touched, or indeed so much as a passenger's baggage examined.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6202"/>I carried out my intention, already expressed, of keeping the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi> in company with me, for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, hoping that I might capture some less valuable ship, into which to turn her passengers, that I might destroy her. I was very anxious to destroy this ship, as she belonged to <persName n="Vanderbilt,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0038.00535.01343" reg="mostcommon:Vanderbilt,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vanderbilt</surname></persName>, of New York, an old steamboat captain, who had amassed a large fortune, in trade, and was a bitter enemy of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6203"/>Lucrative contracts during the war had greatly enhanced his gains, and he had ambitiously made a present of <num value="1">one</num> of his steamers to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, to be called after him, to pursue <q direct="unspecified">rebel pirates.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6204"/></p> 
<p>Failing to overhaul another ship of the enemy in the few days that I had at my disposal, I released the <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ariel</foreName></persName></hi>, on ransombond, and sent her, and her large number of passengers, on their way rejoicing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6292"/>It was just the thing I wanted, however, for I at once conceived the design of drawing this single ship of the enemy far enough away from the remainder of her fleet, to enable me to decide a battle with her before her consorts could come to her relief.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6293"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was still under sail, though, of course, being so near the enemy, the water was warm in her boilers, and in a condition to give us steam in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. To carry out my design of decoying the enemy, I now wore ship, as though I were fleeing from his pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6294"/>This, no doubt, encouraged him, though, as it would seem, the captain of the pursuing ship pretty soon began to smell a rat, as the reader will see presently by his report of the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6295"/>I now lowered my propeller, still holding on to my sails, however, and gave the ship a small head of steam, to prevent the stranger from overhauling me too rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6296"/>We were still too close to the fleet, to think of engaging him. I thus decoyed him on, little by little, now turning my propeller over slowly, and now stopping it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6297"/>In the meantime night set in, before we could get a distinct view of our pursuer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6298"/>She was evidently a large steamer, but we knew from her build and rig, that she belonged neither to the class of old steam frigates, or that of the new sloops, and we were quite willing to try our strength with any of the other classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6299"/><pb id="p.543" n="543"/></p> 
<p>At length, when I judged that I had drawn the stranger out about <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> from his fleet, I furled my sails, beat to quarters, prepared my ship for action, and wheeled to meet him. The <num value="2">two</num> ships now approached each other, very rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6300"/>As we came within speaking distance, we simultaneously stopped our engines, the ships being about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6301"/>The enemy was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6302"/><q direct="unspecified">What ship is that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6303"/>cried he. <q direct="unspecified">This is her Britannic Majesty's <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Petrel</rs>,</q> we replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6304"/>We now hailed in turn, and demanded to know who he was. The reply not coming to us very distinctly, we repeated our question, when we heard the words, <q direct="unspecified">This is the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ship&mdash;&mdash;</q> the name of the ship being lost to us. But we had heard enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6305"/>All we wanted to know was, that the stranger was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ship, and therefore our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6306"/>A pause now ensued&mdash;a rather awkward pause, as the reader may suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6307"/>Presently, the stranger hailed again, and said, <q direct="unspecified">If you please, I will send a boat on board of you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6308"/>His object was, of course, to verify or discredit the answer we had given him, that we were <num value="1">one</num> of her Britannic Majesty's cruisers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6309"/>We replied, <q direct="unspecified">Certainly, we shall be happy to receive your boat;</q> and we heard a boatswain's mate call away a boat, and could hear the creaking of the tackles, as she was lowered into the water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6310"/>Things were now come to a crisis, and it being useless to delay our engagement with the enemy any longer, I turned to my first lieutenant, and said, <q direct="unspecified">I suppose you are all ready for action?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6311"/><q direct="unspecified">We are,</q> he replied; <q direct="unspecified">the men are eager to begin, and are only waiting for the word.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6312"/>I then said to him, <q direct="unspecified">Tell the enemy who we are, for we must not strike him in disguise, and when you have done so, give him the broadside.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6314"/>and turning to the crew, who were all standing at their guns &mdash; the gunners with their sights on the enemy, and lock-strings in handgave the order, fire!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6315"/>Away went the broadside in an instant, our little ship feeling, perceptibly, the recoil of her guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6316"/>The night was clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6317"/>There was no moon, but sufficient star-light to enable the <num value="2">two</num> ships to see each other quite distinctly, at the distance of half a mile, or more, and a state of the atmosphere <pb id="p.544" n="544"/> highly favorable to the conduct of sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6318"/>The wind, besides, was blowing in the direction of the enemy's fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6319"/>As a matter of course, our guns awakened the echoes of the coast, far and near, announcing very distinctly to the <rs>Federal Admiral</rs>&mdash; <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n0133.0039.00544.01364" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bell</surname></persName>, a Southern man, who had gone over to the enemy &mdash; that the ship which he had sent out to chase the strange sail, had a fight on her hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6320"/>He immediately, as we afterward learned, got under way; with the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, his</hi> flag-ship, and <num value="2">two</num> others of his steamers, and came out to the rescue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6321"/>Our broadside was returned instantly; the enemy, like ourselves, having been on his guard, with his men standing at their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6322"/>The <num value="2">two</num> ships, when the action commenced, had swerved in such a way, that they were now heading in the same direction&mdash; the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> fighting her starboard-broadside, and her antagonist her port-broadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6323"/>Each ship, as she delivered her broadside, put herself under steam, and the action became a running fight, in parallel lines, or nearly so, the ships now nearing, and now separating a little from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6324"/>My men handled their pieces with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name> and commendable coolness, and the action was sharp and exciting while it lasted; which, however, was not very long, for in just <hi rend="italics"><measure n="13minutes" type="date">thirteen minutes</measure></hi> after firing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun, the enemy hoisted a light, and fired an off-gun, as a signal that he had been beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6325"/>We at once withheld our fire, and such a cheer went up from the brazen throats of my fellows, as must have astonished even a Texan, if he had heard it. We now steamed up quite close to the beaten steamer, and asked her captain, formally, if he had surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6326"/>He replied that he had. I then inquired if he was in want of assistance, to which he responded promptly that he was, that his ship was sinking rapidly, and that he needed all our boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6327"/>There appeared to be much confusion on board the enemy's ship; officers and crew seemed to be apprehensive that we would permit them to drown, and several voices cried aloud to us for assistance, at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6328"/>When the captain of the beaten ship came on board to surrender his sword to me, I learned that I had been engaged with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Hatteras</rs>, <persName n="Blake,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0039.00544.01365" reg="nearbymention:Blake,H.,C.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Blake</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6332"/>Sir: &mdash;It is my painful duty to inform the <name>Department</name> of the destruction of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Hatteras</rs>, recently under my command, by the <name n="Confederate States">rebel</name> steamer <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, on the night of the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th inst.</day></dateStruct>, off the coast of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6333"/>The circumstances of the disaster are as follows: &mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6334"/>Upon the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="11">11th inst.</day></dateStruct>, at <time value="2:30oclock">half-past 2 o'clock</time>, while at anchor in company with the fleet under <persName n="Bell,Commodore,,,," id="n0133.0039.00545.01367" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, off <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston, Texas" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston, Texas</placeName>, I was ordered by signal from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">flag-ship</term> <rs type="ship">Brooklyn</rs>, to chase a sail to the southward and eastward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6335"/>I got under way immediately, and steamed with all speed in the direction indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6336"/>After some time the strange sail could be seen from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi>, and was ascertained to be a steamer, which fact I communicated to the flag-ship by signal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6337"/>I continued the chase and rapidly gained upon the suspicious vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6338"/>Knowing the slow rate of speed of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi>, I at once suspected that deception was being practised, and hence ordered the ship to be cleared for action, with everything in readiness for a determined attack and a vigorous defence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6339"/>When within about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of the vessel, I observed that she had ceased to steam, and was lying broadside and awaiting us. It was nearly <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, and quite dark; but, notwithstanding the obscurity of the night, I felt assured, from the <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> of the vessel and her manoeuvres, that I should soon encounter the <name n="Confederate States">rebel</name> steamer <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. Being able to work but <num value="4">four</num> guns on the side of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> &mdash;<num value="2">two</num> short <num value="32">32</num>-pounders, <num value="1">one</num> <num value="30">30</num>-pounder rifled <name type="weapon">Parrott gun</name>, and <num value="1">one</num> <num value="20">20</num>-pounder rifled gun &mdash;I concluded to close with her, that my guns might be effective, if necessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6340"/>I came within easy speaking range &mdash; about <measure n="75yards" type="distance">seventy-five yards</measure>&mdash; and upon asking, <q direct="unspecified">What steamer is that?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6341"/>received the answer, <q direct="unspecified">Her Britannic Majesty's <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Vixen</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6342"/>I replied that I would send a boat aboard, and immediately gave the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6343"/>In the meantime, the vessels were changing positions, the stranger endeavoring to gain a desirable position for a raking fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6344"/>Almost simultaneously with the piping away of the boat, the strange craft again replied, <q direct="unspecified">We are the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> steamer <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>,</q> which was accompanied with a broadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6345"/>I, at the same moment, returned the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6346"/>Being well aware of the many vulnerable points of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi>, I hoped, by closing with the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, to be able to board her, and thus rid the seas of the piratical craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6347"/>I steamed directly for the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, but she was enabled by her great speed, and the foulness of the bottom of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi>, and, consequently, her diminished speed, to thwart my attempt when I had gained a distance of but <measure n="30yards" type="distance">thirty yards</measure> from her. At this range, musket and pistol shots were exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6348"/>The firing continued with great vigor on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6349"/>At length a shell entered amidships in the hold, setting fire to it, and, at the same instant&mdash;as I can hardly divide the time &mdash; a shell passed through the sick bay, exploding in an adjoining <pb id="p.546" n="546"/> compartment, also producing fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6350"/>Another entered the cylinder, filling the engine-room and deck with steam, and depriving me of my power to manoeuvre the vessel, or to work the pumps, upon which the reduction of the fire depended.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6351"/>With the vessel on fire in <num value="2">two</num> places, and beyond human power, a hopeless wreck upon the waters, with her walking-beam shot away, and her engine rendered useless, I still maintained an active fire, with the double hope of disabling the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> and attracting the attention of the fleet off <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>, which was only twentyeight miles distant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6352"/>It was soon reported to me that the shells had entered the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> at the water-line, tearing off entire sheets of iron, and that the water was rushing in, utterly defying every attempt to remedy the evil, and that she was rapidly sinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6353"/>Learning the melancholy truth, and observing that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was on my port bow, entirely beyond the range of my guns, doubtless preparing for a raking fire of the deck, I felt I had no right to sacrifice uselessly, and without any desirable result, the lives of all under my command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6354"/>To prevent the blowing up of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> from the fire, which was making much progress, I ordered the magazine to be flooded, and afterward a lee gun was fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6355"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> then asked if assistance was desired, to which an affirmative answer was given.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6356"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> was then going down, and in order to save the lives of my officers and men, I caused the armament on the port side to be thrown overboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6357"/>Had I not done so, I am confident the vessel would have gone down with many brave hearts and valuable lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6358"/>After considerable delay, caused by the report that a steamer was seen coming from <placeName reg="Galveston, Galveston Island, Galveston" key="tgn,7014041">Galveston</placeName>, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> sent us assistance, and I have the pleasure of informing the <name>Department</name> that every living being was conveyed safely from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6359"/><measure n="2minutes" type="date">Two minutes</measure> after leaving the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> she went down, bow <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, with her pennant at the mast-head, with all her muskets and stores of every description, the enemy not being able, owing to her rapid sinking, to obtain a single weapon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6360"/>The battery upon the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> brought into action against the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> numbered <num value="7">seven</num> guns, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> long <num value="32">32</num>-pounders, <num value="100">one 100</num>-pounder, <num value="1">one</num> <num value="68">68</num>-pounder, and <num value="1">one</num> <num value="24">24</num>-pounder rifled gun. The great superiority of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, with her powerful battery and her machinery under the water-line, must be at once recognized by the <name>Department</name>, who are familiar with the construction of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi>, and her total unfitness for a conflict with a regular built vessel of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6361"/>The distance between the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi> and the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> during the action varied from <num value="25">twenty-five</num> to <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>. Nearly <num value="50">fifty</num> shots were fired from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName></hi>, and I presume a greater number from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6619"/>The old city being named in honor of St. Dominic, great pains were evidently bestowed upon the church and convent that were to bear his name; and so substantially was the former built, that it stands entire, and is still used as a place of worship, after the lapse of <measure n="350years" type="date">three hundred and fifty years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6627"/>His name?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6628"/>We cannot make it out. The record of a bishop, carved upon the enduring marble, and placed upon the floor of his own cathedral, has been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6630"/>Raise your eyes now from the floor, and cast them on the wall opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6631"/>In that niche, in the great cathedral wall, sang the choir of ancient days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6632"/>These vaulted roofs have resounded with music from the lips of many generations of beauties, that have faded like the butterfly of the field, leaving no more trace of their <pb id="p.570" n="570"/> names and lineage than that little wanderer of an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6633"/>There stands the silent organ, whose last note was sounded a century or more ago, with its gilding all tarnished, its stately carving tumbled down and lying in debris at its feet, and the bat and the spider building their nests in the cylinders that once mimicked the thunder, and sent thrills of devotion through the hearts of the multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6634"/>There are remains of frescoes on the walls, but the damp and the mildew, in this humid climate, have so effectually performed their office, that the bright colors have disappeared, and only a dim outline of their design is visible.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6635"/>Let us step over from the cathedral, to the conventual portion of the massive block.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6636"/>The walls, as you see, are extensive, and are standing, in a sufficient state of preservation, to enable us to trace out the ground-plan, and reconstruct, in imagination, the ancient edifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6639"/>In the centre of the square, occupying the space, which, in a private house, would have been appropriated to a <hi rend="italics">jet d'eau</hi>, and flowers in vases, is an oblong hall, connected at either end with the main building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6640"/>This was the refectory of the ancient establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6641"/>What scenes does not the very sight of this refectory present to the imagination?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6642"/>We see the table spread, with its naked board, humble service, and still more humble food; we hear the dinner-signal sound; and we see long lines of bearded and hooded monks, with crosses and beads pendent from their girdles, enter, and seat themselves to partake of the wonted refreshment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6643"/>We hear the subdued hum of many voices&mdash; the quiet joke, and half-suppressed merriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6644"/>There, at the head of the board, sits the venerable abbot, whilst the chaplain reads his Latin text, from his stand, during the repast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6710"/>The next day, we had an alarm of fire on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6711"/>It was near <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>. I happened to be standing on the horse-block, at the time, observing the sun for latitude, when suddenly I heard a confusion of voices below, and simultaneously the officer of the deck, with evident alarm depicted in his countenance, came running to me, and said, <q direct="unspecified">The ship is on fire, sir!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6712"/>This is an alarm that always startles the seaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6713"/>The <q direct="unspecified">fire-bell in the night</q> is sufficiently alarming to the landsman, but the cry of fire at sea imports a matter of life and death &mdash;especially in a ship of war, whose boats are always insufficient to carry off her crew, and whose magazine and shell-rooms are filled with powder, and the loaded missiles of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6714"/>The firebell on board a ship of war, whose crew is always organized as a fire company, points out the duty of every officer and man in such an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6715"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be done is to <q direct="unspecified">beat to quarters,</q> and accordingly I gave this order to the officer; but before the drummer could brace his drum for the operation, it was announced that all danger had disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6716"/>When we had a little leisure to look into the facts, it appeared, that the alarm had arisen from the carelessness of the <q direct="unspecified">captain of the hold,</q> who, in violation of the orders of the ship, had taken a naked light below with him, into the spirit-room, to pump off the grog by. The candle had ignited some of the escaping gas, but the flame was suppressed almost immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6717"/>The captain of the hold, who is a petty officer, paid the penalty <pb id="p.576" n="576"/> of his disobedience, by being dismissed from his office; and in half an hour, the thing was forgotten.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6718"/>Since leaving the <rs>Mona Passage</rs>, we had been steering about N. N. W., or as near north as the trade-wind would permit us. We expected, as a matter of course, to meet with the usual calms, as we came up with the <rs>Tropic</rs> of Cancer, but the north-east trade, instead of dying away, as we had expected, hauled to the south-east, and shot us across the calm-belt, with a fine breeze all the way. We carried this wind to the twentyseventh parallel, when we took, with scarcely any intermission, a fresh north-wester.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6719"/>This does not often happen in the experience of the navigator, as the reader has seen, when he has before been crossing the calm-belts with us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6722"/>We gave chase to her, soon after breakfast, and came up with her about <time value="1:30">half-past 1</time> P. M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6724"/>Upon examination of the papers of the schooner, it appeared that the cargo was shipped by the <rs>Spanish</rs> house of Harques &amp; Maseras, domiciled, and doing business in New York, to Vincent Brothers, <placeName reg="San Juan,San Juan,Puerto Rico,North and Central America" key="tgn,7005859">in San Juan, Porto Rico</placeName>, on joint account; the shippers owning <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, and the consignee <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6727"/>The next afternoon we sighted a sail on our weather-bow, close hauled, like ourselves, and continued to gain upon her, until night shut her out from view, when we discontinued the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6728"/>We were satisfied from her appearance, that she was neutral, or we should, probably, have expended a little steam upon her. At night the weather set in thick, and the wind blew so fresh from the north-east, that we took a single reef in the topsails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6729"/>This bad weather continued for the next <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, reducing us, a part of the time, to close reefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6732"/>The next day, the weather being very fine, with the wind light from the southward and eastward, a sail was descried from aloft, and soon afterward another, and another, until <num value="4">four</num> were seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6733"/>We gave chase to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sail announced; standing to the eastward, in pursuit of her, for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, but she being a long distance ahead, and to windward, and the chase being likely, in consequence, to be long, and to draw us away from the other <num value="3">three</num> sail, besides, we abandoned it, and gave chase to <num value="2">two</num> of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6734"/>These were fine, tall ships, under a cloud of canvas, steering, <num value="1">one</num> to the eastward, and the other to the westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6736"/>Coming up with the eastwardbound ship, we hove her to, but not until we had thrown a couple of shot at her, in succession&mdash;the latter whizzing over the master's head on the quarter-deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6737"/>She was evidently endeavoring to draw us after her, as far to the eastward as possible, to give her consort, with whom she had spoken, and who was running, as the reader has seen, to the westward, an opportunity to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6738"/>Throwing a boat's crew hastily on board of her, and directing the prize-master to follow us, we <pb id="p.578" n="578"/> now wheeled in pursuit of the other fugitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6739"/>The latter was, by this time, <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles distant</measure>&mdash;being hull down&mdash; and was running before the wind with studding sails, <q direct="unspecified">alow and aloft.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6740"/>Fortunately for the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, as before remarked, the wind was light, or the chase might have put darkness between us, before we came up with her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6741"/>She was less obstinate than her consort, and shortened sail, and hove to, at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun, hoisting the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors at her peak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6742"/>She proved to be the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Olive Jane</rs>, of New York, from <placeName key="tgn,7008161" n="1.000 4" reg="bordeaux,gironde,aquitaine,france,europe">Bordeaux</placeName>, bound to New York, with an assorted cargo of <name>French</name> wines, and brandies, canned meats, fruits, and other delicacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6743"/>There was no attempt to cover the cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6744"/>There were a great many shippers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6745"/>Some few of these had consigned their goods to their own order, but most of the consignments were to New York houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6746"/>It is possible that some of the consignments, <q direct="unspecified">to order,</q> really belonged to <name>French</name> owners, but if so, I was relieved from the necessity of making the investigation, by the carelessness of the owners themselves, who had taken no pains to protect their property, by proper documentary evidence of its neutral character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6747"/>In the absence of sworn proof, as before remarked, the rule of law is imperative, that all property found on board of an enemy's ship, is presumed to belong to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6748"/>I acted upon this presumption, and set fire to the <hi rend="italics">Olive Jane</hi>. What a splendid libation was here to old <persName n="Neptune,,,,," id="n0133.0041.00578.01449" reg="mostcommon:Neptune,nomatch:0"><surname>Neptune</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6751"/>I should have permitted Bartelli, and the other stewards to have a short run among these delicacies, but for the wine and the brandy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6752"/>A Fouche could not have prevented the boats' crews from smuggling some of it on board, and then I might have had another <placeName key="tgn,7005870" n="1.000 1" reg="martinique,north and central america">Martinique</placeName> grog-watering on my hands.

<p>Amid the crackling of flames, the bursting of brandy casks, the shrivelling of sails, as they were touched by the fire, and the tumbling of the lighter spars of the <hi rend="italics">Olive Jane</hi> from aloft, we turned our head to the eastward again, and rejoined our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prize, coming up with her just as the shades of evening were closing in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6754"/>She, like the <hi rend="italics">Olive Jane</hi>, had shown me the <q direct="unspecified">old flag,</q> and that, of course, had set at rest all doubts as to the nationality of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6755"/>There was as little doubt, as soon appeared, about the cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6758"/>There she had taken in a cargo of guano, for Cork and a market; the guano being owned by, and consigned to the order of the <rs>American Guano Company</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6759"/>This ship had buffeted the gales of the frozen latitudes of <placeName key="possibilities=34" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Cape Horn</placeName>, threaded her pathway among its icebergs, been parched with the heats of the tropic, and drenched with the rains of the equator, to fall into the hands of her enemy, only a few <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> from her port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6760"/>But such is the fortune of war. It seemed a pity, too, to destroy so large a cargo of a fertilizer, that would else have made fields stagger under a wealth of grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6761"/>But those fields would be the fields of the enemy; or if it did not fertilize his fields, its sale would pour a stream of gold into his coffers; and it was my business upon the high seas, to cut off, or dry up this stream of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6762"/>The torch followed the examination of the papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6763"/>The reader may, perhaps, by this time have remarked, how fond the <rs>Yankees</rs> had become of the qualifying adjective, <q direct="unspecified">golden,</q> as a prefix to the names of their ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6783"/>Reaching the blazed road, of which I spoke in the last chapter, I shortened sail, at the crossing mentioned, that I might waylay such of the passengers as chanced to be enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6784"/>There were a great many ships passing, both ways, on this road, some going to the <rs>Pacific</rs>, or the <rs>Far East</rs>, and others returning from those distant points; but they were nearly all neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6788"/>It now became calm, and we were compelled to get up steam, to overhaul the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6789"/>They lay long distances apart, and we were several hours in passing from <num value="1">one</num> to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6790"/>They were all Englishmen, with various histories and destinations, <num value="1">one</num> of them&mdash; a fine frigate-built ship&mdash;being a Melbourne and <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> <pb id="p.582" n="582"/> packet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6791"/>We received a paper from her, printed at the antipodes, but there was not much in it, besides the proceedings of the <rs>Australian Parliament</rs>, news from the gold-diggings, and the price of wool; in neither of which subjects were we much interested.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6792"/>On the next day but a solitary passenger came over the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6793"/>It was late at night when she made her appearance&mdash; there being a bright moon and a brisk breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6794"/>We made sail in chase, and the chase, taking the alarm, gave us a very pretty run for a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6795"/>We overhauled her, however, at length, and fired the usual blank cartridge, to heave her to. She was an hermaphrodite brig, and might be, for aught we could see, in the uncertain light, American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6796"/>The gun had no effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6797"/>We waited a few minutes for a response, but none coming, we fired again&mdash;sending a shot whizzing, this time, over the little craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6798"/>Still no response.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6800"/>All was as silent on board the chase as death, and not a tack or sheet had been started.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6801"/>We ran now almost on board of her, and hailing her, commanded her to heave to. Great confusion followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6802"/>We could hear voices speaking in a foreign tongue, and presently a disorderly array of sails whipping and flapping in the wind, and of yards swinging to and fro, presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6803"/>At last the little craft managed to come to the wind, and make a halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6804"/>She proved to be a Portuguese brig, and the crew had been so alarmed, at being chased and fired at, by night, as to lose all presence of mind, and become incapable of any action whatever, until they were somewhat reassured, by the near presence of our ship and the sound of our voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6809"/>They were all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> bound, and were jogging along, in company, following <persName n="Maury,,,,," id="n0133.0042.00583.01463" reg="mostcommon:Maury,Matthew,F.,,:2"><surname>Maury</surname></persName>'s blazes, like so many passengers on a highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6810"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> stood like a toll-gate before them, and though we could not take toll of them, as they were all neutral, we made each traveller show us his passport, as he came up. <num value="1">One</num> obstinate fellow&mdash;a Hamburger&mdash;refused to show us his colors, until he was commanded to do so by a gun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6811"/>On the present occasion, the <name>Hamburger</name> was detained a considerable time, whilst I exercised, at my leisure, my belligerent right of <hi rend="italics">viseing</hi> his papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6812"/>When his travelling companions were some miles ahead of him, I told the surly fellow to pick up his hat and be off.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6817"/>She was a fine, large ship, and the moment she showed an intention not to pass through the toll-gate, we made sail in pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6818"/>She had heels, but they were not quite as clean as the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>'s</hi>, and we came up with her, in the course of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>; she having approached pretty close, before she smelt the rat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6819"/>The shower-bath made a stir among the bystanders; there was a running hither and thither, a letting go of sheets and halliards, and pretty soon the main-yard swung aback, and the stars and stripes were seen ascending to the stranger's peak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6820"/>When the boarding-officer brought the master of the captured ship on board, with his papers, she proved to be the <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Washington</rs>, of New York, from the <rs type="place">Chincha Islands</rs>, bound to <placeName key="tgn,2078243" n="1.000 6" reg="antwerp, paulding, ohio">Antwerp</placeName>, with a cargo of guano, laden on account of the <name>Peruvian</name> government, and consigned <pb id="p.584" n="584"/> to its agent at <placeName key="tgn,2078243" n="1.000 6" reg="antwerp, paulding, ohio">Antwerp</placeName>, for sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6826"/>The night had been rather dark, and we had been lying &mdash; to under topsails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>In the darkness of the night, an enemy's ship had approached us unawares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6828"/>She had been following the blazes, without seeing the toll-gate, and the revelations made by the morning's light, must have startled her; for she found herself within half a mile of an exceedingly saucy-looking gunboat, lying in wait for somebody, or something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6829"/>It was nearly calm, and she could not help herself if she would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>On the other hand, the gunboat was delighted to see a tall ship, whose masts tapered like a lady's fingers, arrayed in the whitest of petticoats&mdash;to carry out our figure&mdash;and which, from the course she was steering, was evidently just out from Yankee-land, with that mail on board, which we had been anxiously looking for, for several days past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/>We were in the midst of the scrubbing and cleaning of the morning watch, and to effect the capture, it was not even necessary to lay aside a holy-stone, or a scrubbing-brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6832"/>A gun and a Confederate flag, were all that was required to bring the tall ship to a halt, and remove her doubts, if she had had any.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6834"/>There was an affidavit found among her papers, made by <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Snyder,,,,," id="n0133.0042.00584.01466" reg="mostcommon:Snyder,nomatch:0"><surname>Snyder</surname></persName>, before <persName n="Pierrepont,Mister,Edwards,,," id="n0133.0042.00584.01467" reg="default:Pierrepont,Edwards,,,"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edwards</foreName> <surname>Pierrepont</surname></persName>, who appears to have been acting as British Consul, claiming that the cargo was shipped on account of a London house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6835"/>The real facts of the case, however, as gathered from the correspondence, and the testimony of the master, were, that <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.585" n="585"/> <persName n="Davidson,,,,," id="n0133.0042.00585.01468" reg="mostcommon:Davidson,nomatch:0"><surname>Davidson</surname></persName>, a lumber dealer in New York had chartered the ship, and shipped the lumber, in the usual course of his business, to the parties in <placeName reg="Montevideo, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113062">Montevideo</placeName>; that he had paid most of the freight, in advance, and insured himself against the <hi rend="italics">war risk</hi>, both upon the cargo and the freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6836"/>The manner in which this case was <q direct="unspecified">put up,</q> in the papers, was an improvement upon some others I had examined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6837"/>The New York merchants were evidently becoming expert in the preparation of bogus certificates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6838"/>It was no longer merely stated that the property belonged to <q direct="unspecified">neutral owners,</q> but the owners themselves were named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6839"/>In short, the certificate found on board the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Parks,,,,," id="n0133.0042.00585.01469" reg="nearbymention:Parks,John,A.,,"><surname>Parks</surname></persName></hi> was in due form, but unfortunately for the parties who contrived the clever little plot, the master forgot to throw overboard his letter-bag, and among the letters found in that bag, was <num value="1">one</num> written by <persName n="Davidson,,,,," id="n0133.0042.00585.01470" reg="mostcommon:Davidson,nomatch:0"><surname>Davidson</surname></persName>, giving instructions to the consignees, in which the following expressions occur: <q direct="unspecified">The cargo of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Parks,,John,A.,," id="n0133.0042.00585.01471" reg="default:Parks,John,A.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Parks</surname></persName></hi>, I shall have certified to, by the <rs>British Consul</rs>, as the property of <name>British</name> subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6842"/>As well as I recollect, he declined the coffee, but I am quite certain that the ship was burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6843"/>The carpenter of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was thrown into ecstasies by this capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6854"/>I now resolved to fill away, stand down toward the equator, and hold myself stationary, for a few days, at the <q direct="unspecified">crossing</q> of that famous great circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6855"/>I was far enough to the eastward, to make a free wind of the north-east trade, and we jogged along under topsails, making sail only when it became necessary to chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6856"/>We-lost our fine weather almost immediately upon leaving the <q direct="unspecified">crossing,</q> and took a series of moderate gales&mdash; sometimes, however, reducing us to close reefs&mdash;which lasted us for a week or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, or until we began to approach the rains and calms of the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6919"/>We were in chase of a sail at the time, but lost her in the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6920"/>It rained all night, with light airs and calms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6921"/>We have experienced a southeasterly current, setting at the rate of a knot and <num value="0.5">a half</num> the hour, for the last <num value="24">twenty-four</num>-hours.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6923"/>We now encountered a variety of currents, some setting to the south-east as just mentioned, others to the east, others to the south, until finally we fell in with the great equatorial current setting to the westward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6924"/>The study of the phenomena of the currents, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting that can engage the attention of the marine philosopher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6925"/>We have already had occasion to explain the circulation of the atmosphere&mdash;how the wind <q direct="unspecified">cometh and goeth,</q> not at random, but in obedience to certain well-defined natural laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6926"/>The circulation of the sea is no less regular than that of the atmosphere, and has equally important offices to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6927"/>If the sea were a stagnant mass of waters, some portions of the earth which now enjoy temperate climates, and teem with <num value="1000000">millions</num> of population in the enjoyment of an abundant fauna and flora, would be almost uninhabitable because of the extreme cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6928"/>Some portions of the sea would dry up, and become beds of salt, and others again would, from the superabundance of precipitation, become fresh, or nearly so. In short, there would be a general disturbance of the harmonies of creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6929"/>To obviate this, and to put the sea in motion, various agencies have been set at work by the great Architect; chief among which is the unequal distribution of heat over the earth's surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6930"/>We have already called the sun the <rs>Father</rs> of the <name>Winds</name>; he is equally the father of the currents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6931"/>The warm water of the equator is constantly flowing off to the poles, and the cold water of the poles flowing back, as undercurrents, to the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6932"/>This flow is not directly north, or directly south, but by a variety of tortuous channels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6933"/>The different depths of the ocean, the obstructions of islands, and continents, clouds and Sunshine, and a great many other agencies, combine to give this tortuosity and seeming irregularity to the currents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6934"/>Let us take an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6935"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> has just experienced a south-east current in a locality where the current sets, as a general rule, to the westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6936"/>How are we to account for this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6937"/>It may be due to a variety of causes, all working in harmony, however, with the general design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6938"/>In the first place, it may be a counter-current going to fill the place left <pb id="p.592" n="592"/> vacant by some other current; for, as a matter of course, when a given quantity of water flows away from a place, the same quantity must flow back to it. Or it may be a principal, and not an accessory current, set in motion, say by heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6939"/>Let us see how easily this may be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6940"/>Suppose a dense canopy of clouds to overshadow some considerable space of the sea, for a day, or it may be, for a few hours only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6941"/>Whilst the rays of the sun are shut out from this space, they are pouring down their heat with tropical fervor, say to the south of this cloud-bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6942"/>Under the cloud-bank the water is cooling, beyond the bank it is being heated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6943"/>Under the bank evaporation has ceased almost altogether, beyond the bank it is going on at the rate of about an inch in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. Here are powerful agencies at work, changing both the temperature, and specific gravity of the waters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6944"/>Waters to be at rest must have the same temperature and specific gravity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6945"/>These waters therefore cannot remain at rest, and a current is the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/>To-morrow, perhaps, the process will be reversed, the cloud and the sunshine changing places, and the current flowing in a contrary direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6947"/>These are local disturbances of the system of oceanic circulation&mdash; little venous derangements, as it were, the great arterial system not being materially affected by them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6948"/>There are other exceedingly beautiful agencies at work, on a smaller scale, to disturb the oceanic equilibrium, and set the waters in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6949"/>It has puzzled philosophers to account for the saltness of the sea. Whatever may be its cause, it plays a very important part in giving vitality to its circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6950"/>If sea-water were fresh, evaporation would not produce any change in its specific gravity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/><num value="1">One</num> element of motion, therefore, would be wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6952"/>But being salt, and the salts not being taken up by the thirsty air, in the process of evaporation, every rain-drop that is withdrawn from it, helps to put the currents in motion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6953"/>But these are surface operations; let us dive beneath the surface, and witness some of the wonders that are going on in the depths below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/>We have before shown the reader, the coralline insect, that wonderful little stone-mason of the sea, which, in the hands of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, is the architect of islands and continents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6955"/>The sea-water is the quarry from which this little <pb id="p.593" n="593"/> toiler extracts his tiny blocks of masonry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6956"/>If the water were fresh, it would not hold the materials in solution, which he needs for his work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6957"/>But being salt, it has just the materials which he needs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>But how does he affect the currents?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6959"/>the reader will ask. As follows: Every particle of solid matter that he extracts from the sea-water&mdash;and he must have limestone to build those islands and continents of which he is the architect&mdash;alters its specific gravity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6960"/>The little globule of water, from which he has just taken the block of stone that would be scarcely visible under a powerful microscope, has become lighter than the surrounding globules, and ascends to the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>In obedience to the law which we have mentioned, that as much water must flow back to a place, as flows away from it, a globule of water from the surface now descends to take the place of that which has arisen; descends to the little stonemason, that he may rob it, in turn, of the block of stone that it contains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>The globules of water thus become the hod-carriers for these little stone-masons, working away, in countless myriads, at the bottom of the sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>But what becomes of this lighter globule of water, which has arisen to the surface, because it has been deprived of its solid matter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6964"/>It must flow away somewhere in search of the salts it has lost, for if it remain stationary, in course of time, the sea in its neighborhood will all be deprived of its salts, and there will be no more globules to descend to the little stonemason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/>But when the globule starts to flow off, a current is established.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6966"/>The reader may recollect that when we were at the <rs>Azores</rs>, breaking up that <name>Yankee</name> whaling station, we spoke of the currents, in connection with the whales, and other fishes; how, like <q direct="unspecified">reapers and gleaners,</q> they bore to them the food which was prepared for them in other latitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6967"/>The reader sees, now, how the currents build the coral bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6968"/>Every sea-shell, as it secretes the solid matter for its edifice, helps on the movement set on foot by the coral insect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6969"/>On the <dateStruct value="-04-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, we observed in latitude <num value="2">2</num>&deg; <num value="11">11</num>&prime; S.; our longitude being <num value="26">26</num>&deg; <num value="02">02</num>&prime;.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6970"/><pb id="p.594" n="594"/> During the morning watch, the dense clouds lifted for a while, and showed us a fine, tall ship, steering, like ourselves, to the southward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6971"/>We immediately made sail in chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6996"/>It forms the western end of a chain of volcanic islands and deep-sea soundings that extend some distance along the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6997"/>Earthquakes have been frequently experienced by ships when passing along this chain, and the charts point out a number of supposed dangers hereabout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6998"/>Many of these dangers have no real existence, but still the prudent mariner gives them a wide berth, when sailing past the localities assigned them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6999"/>The island of <persName n="Noronha,,Fernando,,,de" id="n0133.0043.00596.01505" reg="expanded:Noronha,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Noronha</surname></persName> is evidently of volcanic origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7002"/>The famous peak before spoken of, and which the mariner at sea descries long before the body of the island becomes visible, is a queer freak of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7007"/>Nor is his surprise diminished, as his ship approaches nearer, and the body of the island begins to make its appearance above the water; for there is the roof of the massive cathedral, to which the steeple belongs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7008"/>The peak is a mass of solid granite, shot by the earthquake through the solid crust of the mountain, and is almost symmetrical enough to have been shaped by human hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7010"/>The winds, the rains, and the sunshine have, in the course of ages, disintegrated enough of the surface of this rocky island, to form a rich soil, which is covered with a profusion of tropical vegetation, including forest-trees of considerable size; and a number of small farms, with neat farm-houses, add to the picturesqueness of the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7011"/>Fruits and vegetables, the <rs>Indian</rs> corn, and the sugar-cane, flourish in great perfection, and a few ponies and horned cattle have been introduced from the main land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7015"/>A ship rarely ever touches at the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7016"/>There is nothing to invite communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7017"/>It is too insignificant for traffic, and has no good harbor where a ship could repair damages or refit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7018"/>It is, besides, a penal colony of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, to which it belongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7020"/>Very few of the prisoners are kept in close confinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7021"/>The island itself is prison enough, and there are no possible means of escape from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7024"/>The next morning a couple of gentlemen visited me, on the part of the <rs>Governor</rs>, to arrange personally with the paymaster, the matter of supplies, and to welcome me to the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7026"/>A popping of corks, and a mutual clinking of glasses ensued, and when we had resumed conversation and lighted cigars, <num value="1">one</num> of the gentlemen diplomats informed me, in the most easy and <hi rend="italics">san souciant</hi> manner possible, that he was <num value="1">one</num> of the convicts of the island!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7028"/>Several of my officers were present, and there was, of course, a casting of glances from <num value="1">one</num> to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7029"/>But Bartelli, who was still standing a few paces in the rear, with a fresh bottle of uncorked champagne in his hand, seemed to be most shocked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7030"/>My faithful steward felt the honors and dignity of my station much more than I did myself, and it was amusing to see the smile of derision and contempt, with which he wheeled round, and replaced the uncorked bottle in the champagne basket.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7032"/>He had kindly sent horses for us to the beach, and we had a pleasant ride of about a mile, before we reached his headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7033"/>It was about <time value="11am">eleven A. M.</time>, when we alighted, and were escorted by an aide-de-camp to his presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7034"/>The Governor was a thin, spare man, rather under the medium height, and of sprightly manners and <pb id="p.599" n="599"/> conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7035"/>His complexion, like that of most Brazilians, was about that of a side of tanned sole-leather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7036"/>His rank was that of a major in the <rs>Brazilian Army</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7037"/>He received us very cordially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7038"/>We found him at breakfast with his family and some guests, and he insisted that we should be seated at the breakfast-table, and partake of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> breakfast, though we endeavored to decline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7039"/>The meal was quite substantial, consisting of a variety of roast meats, as well as fruits and vegetables.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7040"/>As soon as I could find a little time to look around me, I discovered that her ladyship, the governess, was a very sprightly and not uncomely mulatto, and that her <num value="2">two</num> little children, who were brought to me with all due ceremony, to be praised, and have their heads patted, had rather kinky, or, perhaps, I should say curly, hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7041"/>But I was a man of the world, and was not at all dismayed by this discovery; especially when I observed that my <hi rend="italics">vis-a-vis</hi> &mdash; <num value="1">one</num> of the guests &mdash; was a beautiful blonde, of sweet <num value="17">seventeen</num>, with a complexion like a lily, tinted with the least bit of rose, and with eyes so melting and lovely, that they looked as though they might have belonged to <num value="1">one</num> of the houris, of whom that old reprobate Mahomet used to dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7042"/>To set off her charms still further, she was arrayed in a robe of the purest white, with a wreath of flowers in her flaxen hair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7043"/>She was a German, and was seated next to her father, a man of about <num value="60">sixty</num>, who, as the <rs>Governor</rs> afterward informed me, was <num value="1">one</num> of his chief criminals.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7044"/>The Governor seeing me start a little as he gave me this information, made haste to explain, that his guest was not of the <hi rend="italics">canaille</hi>, or common class of rogues, but a gentleman, who, in a moment of weakness, had signed another gentleman's name to a check for a considerable amount, which he had been clever enough to have cashed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7048"/>There was certainly no gainsaying the latter proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7049"/>The chaplain of the penal colony &mdash;which numbered about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> convicts, the entire population of the island being about <num value="2000">two thousand</num>&mdash;a portly and dignified priest, was also at the breakfast-table, and my paymaster and myself spent a very pleasant half-hour around this social board, <pb id="p.600" n="600"/> at which were represented so many of the types of mankind, and so different moral elements.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7050"/>From the breakfast-table, we retired to a withdrawing-room, which was pretty well filled when we entered, showing that his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> had done me the honor to get some guests together to greet me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7051"/>Among others, was present the ambassador of the day previous, who had given such a shock to Bartelli's nerves, as to render him incapable of doing that which he loved above all other things to do&mdash;draw a champagne cork for the <rs>Captain</rs>'s guests, whom he regarded, after a certain fashion, as his own. The Governor had evidently been select in his society, for most of these gentlemen were not only well dressed, but well-mannered, and some of them were even distinguished in appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7052"/>They were mostly homicides and forgers, and seemed rather to pride themselves upon the distinction which they had attained in their <hi rend="italics">professions</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7054"/>He wore an elaborately embroidered shirt-bosom, on which glittered a diamond brooch of great brilliancy, and there were chains hung about his neck, and signet and other rings on his fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7055"/>This fellow was such a master of the pen, that he could cheat any man out of his signature, after having seen him write but once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7056"/>To give us an example of his skill, he sketched, whilst we were talking to him, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and her surroundings, as they appeared from the window of the saloon in which we were sitting, so perfectly, with pen and ink, as to create a murmur of applause among the bystanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7057"/>This charming young gentleman had <q direct="unspecified">done</q> the <name>Bank</name> of <placeName reg="Rio Janeiro">Rio Janeiro</placeName> out of a very large sum, which was the cause of his being the guest of the <rs>Governor</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7058"/>Wine and cigars were brought in, and as we chatted, and smoked with these fellows, the paymaster, and I were highly amused-amused at our own situation, and by the variety of characters by whom we were surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7059"/>The levee being at an end, the <rs>Governor</rs> ordered horses, and, accompanied by an orderly, we rode over his dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7060"/>It was in the midst of the rainy season, and the island was almost constantly wreathed <pb id="p.601" n="601"/>in mists and rain, but as these rains continue for months, noone thinks of housing himself on account of them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7061"/>We passed within a stone's throw of the <name>Peak</name>, and weremore struck than ever, with the grandeur of its proportions and the symmetry of its form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7062"/>The island is broken and picturesque, as all volcanic countries are, and in the midst of the rains, it was <num value="1">one</num> mass of rank vegetation, it being as much as the farmers could do to keep a few patches of cultivation free from the encroaching weeds and jungle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7063"/>We had not been in the saddle more than <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, when a heavily laden, vaporous cloud swept over us, and drenched us to the skin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7064"/>But I found that this was not to interfere, in the least, with our ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7065"/>Its only effect was, to induce the <rs>Governor</rs> to call a temporary halt, at a Manioc factory, in which he was interested, and whistle up a boy, who brought each of us a very small glass filled with the villanous <hi rend="italics">aguadiente</hi> of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7066"/>The Governor tossed his off at a single gulp, and not to be discourteous, we made wry faces, and disposed of as much of ours as we could.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7067"/>We passed through tangled forests, the trees of which were all new to us, and through dells and ravines, in which the living, and the decaying vegetation seemed to be struggling for the mastery, and emerged in a beautiful cocoanut plantation, on the south end of the island, which lay only a few feet above the sea-level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7068"/>I was now at the end of the <rs>Governor</rs>'s dominions&mdash;an hour's ride had brought me from the sea, on <num value="1">one</num> side of them, to the sea, on the other, and there was nothing more to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7069"/>Other showers coming on, we entered a tiny country house of the <rs>Governor</rs>'s, and had some grapes, figs, and melons brought in to us by the major domo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7070"/>The green cocoanut was brought to us among other delicacies, to be eaten with spoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7071"/>We were quite amused at the manner in which these nuts were gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7072"/>The major domo called a boy, and tying his legs together, just above the ankles, so that the ankles were about <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> apart, set him down at the foot of a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7073"/>These trees, as the reader knows, grow to a great height, are perfectly cylindrical, and have not an excrescence of any kind from root to top; and yet the boy, by the aid of the bandage described, wriggled himself to the top of <num value="1">one</num> of the tallest, with the agility of a squirrel.

<p>There being at length a pause in the rains, the sun even peeping through an occasional rift in the ragged and watery clouds, we remounted, and rode back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7075"/>The tiny mountain paths had, many of them, by this time become rills and torrents, and our horses were frequently knee-deep in water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7076"/>The paymaster and I pulled on board at <time value="5pm">five P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7077"/>The next morning the <rs>Governor</rs>'s wife sent me a fat turkey for dinner, accompanied by the most charming of bouquets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7078"/>This was evidently my reward for patting the little curly heads of her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7079"/>My diplomacy from this time onward was all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7080"/>I did not hear a word from the <rs>Governor</rs>, or any <num value="1">one</num> in authority, about neutral rights, or the violation of neutral jurisdictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7082"/>The anchorage being nothing but an open roadstead, we soon found it too rough to permit a ship to lie alongside of us, and so were obliged to haul the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hatch,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00602.01517" reg="nearbymention:Hatch,Louisa,,,"><surname>Hatch</surname></persName></hi> off to her anchors, and continue our coaling with boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7084"/>We had not once thought of a prize, since we came in. Our whole attention had been given to coaling ship, and refitting for another cruise, refreshing the crew, and attending to the ladies at the <rs type="place">Government House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7085"/>But the ubiquitous <rs>Yankee</rs> would turn up in spite of us. Just as we had gotten our last boat-load of coal on board, <num value="2">two</num> ships appeared off the harbor, and were seen to heave to, and lower boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7086"/>We soon made them out to be whalers, and knew them to be American, though they had not as yet hoisted any colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7087"/>The boats pulled in apace, and soon entered the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7088"/>They contained the masters of the <num value="2">two</num> whalers, who had come in to barter a little <rs n="whale oil" type="product">whale oil</rs> for supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7089"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was lying, without <pb id="p.603" n="603"/> any colors hoisted, as was her wont while she remained at this island, and, of course, the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hatch,,Louisa,,," id="n0133.0043.00603.01518" reg="default:Hatch,Louisa,,,"><foreName>Louisa</foreName> <surname>Hatch</surname></persName></hi>, her prize, had none set.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7090"/>The <num value="2">two</num> masters declined to come on board, as they were in a hurry, they said, but remained some time in conversation&mdash;the prize-master, who was an Englishman, endeavoring to play <persName n="Yankee,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00603.01520" reg="mostcommon:Yankee,nomatch:0"><surname>Yankee</surname></persName>, the best he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7095"/>Presently there was a simultaneous start, on the part of both the boat's crews, and the words <q direct="unspecified">starn, all!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7096"/>being bawled, rather than spoken, both boats backed out, in <q direct="unspecified">double quick,</q> and put off, with the most vigorous strokes of their oars, for the shore, like men who were pulling for their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7097"/>The prize-master, a little astonished at this sudden movement, looked around him to see what could have caused it. The cause was soon apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7098"/>A small Confederate flag&mdash;a boat's ensign&mdash;had been thrown by the coxswain of <num value="1">one</num> of the boats on the spanker-boom to dry, and while the conversation was going on, a puff of wind had blown out the folds, and disclosed the little tell-tale to the gaze of the astonished whalers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7099"/>It was not precisely a <placeName reg="Gorgon">Gorgon</placeName>'s head; they did not turn to stone, but perhaps there was some of the tallest pulling done, that day, at <persName n="Noronha,,Fernando,,,de" id="n0133.0043.00603.01521" reg="expanded:Noronha,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Noronha</surname></persName>, that was ever done by a Yankee boat's crew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7100"/>In the meantime, the <q direct="unspecified">Brazilian packet-steamer</q> having gotten up steam, was moving quietly out of the harbor, to look after the ships outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7101"/>They were still lying to, and fortunately for me, they were <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> off; outside of the charmed marine league.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7102"/>There was an outlying shoal or <num value="2">two</num>, in the direction in which they were, and this was the reason, probably, why they had not ventured nearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7103"/>It did not take <pb id="p.604" n="604"/> us long to come up with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7104"/>We fired the usual gun as we approached, and as there was no occasion for <hi rend="italics">ruse</hi>, we showed them our own flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7105"/>They saw in a moment that their fate was sealed, and did not attempt to stir, but hoisted the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors, and patiently waited to be taken possession of. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we came up with, was the <term type="ship">bark</term> <rs type="ship">Lafayette</rs>, of New Bedford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7106"/>There were no papers to be examined&mdash;the mate, in the absence of the captain, having thrown them overboard, as we approached&mdash;and we gave her a short shrift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7107"/>She was burning brightly, in less than an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7108"/>We now ranged up alongside of the other, which proved to be the hermaphrodite <term type="ship">brig</term>, <rs type="ship">Kate Cory</rs>, of <placeName reg="Kansas City, Jackson, Missouri" key="tgn,7013820">Westport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7109"/>Instead of burning the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Cory,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00604.01522" reg="mostcommon:Cory,nomatch:0"><surname>Cory</surname></persName>, I</hi> took her in tow, and stood back to the anchorage with her, it being my intention to convert her into a cartel, and dispatch her to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with my prisoners, who were now quite as numerous as my crew, there being <num value="110">110</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7110"/>By <time value="7pm">seven P. M.</time>, we had again anchored in our old berth; the burning ship outside lighting us into the roadstead, and throwing a bright glare over much of the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7111"/>A number of ships that passed <persName n="Noronha,,Fernando,,,de" id="n0133.0043.00604.01523" reg="expanded:Noronha,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Noronha</surname></persName> that night, must have been astonished at this illumination of the lonely mile-post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7112"/>The sea was smooth, and the ship was still burning, the next morning, though by this time she had drifted so far, that there was nothing visible except a column of smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7113"/>I afterward changed my determination of converting the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Cory,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00604.01524" reg="mostcommon:Cory,nomatch:0"><surname>Cory</surname></persName></hi> into a cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7114"/>A small Brazilian schooner having come into the anchorage, offered to take all my prisoners to <placeName key="tgn,7005443" n="1.000 4" reg="recife,pernambuco,nordeste,brasil,south america">Pernambuco</placeName>, if I would provision them, and give her, besides, a few barrels of pork and flour for her trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7115"/>This I at once consented to do, and the <rs>Governor</rs> having no objection, the arrangement was forthwith made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7116"/>I was thus enabled to burn the <hi rend="italics">Gory</hi>, and to put the enemy, to the expense of sending his released prisoners to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7117"/>I burned the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hatch,,Louisa,,," id="n0133.0043.00604.01525" reg="default:Hatch,Louisa,,,"><foreName>Louisa</foreName> <surname>Hatch</surname></persName></hi> along with the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Cory,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00604.01526" reg="mostcommon:Cory,nomatch:0"><surname>Cory</surname></persName></hi>, having no farther use for her; taking the pains to send them both beyond the marine league, that I might pay due respect to the jurisdiction of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7118"/>And now we were ready for sea again, though I remained a few days longer at my anchors, hoping that the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Agrippina,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00604.01527" reg="mostcommon:Agrippina,nomatch:0"><surname>Agrippina</surname></persName></hi> might arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7119"/>She was past due, but I had not yet given up all hope of her. <pb id="p.605" n="605"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7120"/>We were now getting well along into the latter part of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, and a great change was taking place in the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7121"/>It had been raining, as the reader has observed, ever since we reached the vicinity of the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7122"/>The rains were now becoming less frequent, from day to day, and we had the showers agreeably alternated with sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7123"/>The rainy season was passing away, and the dry season was about to set in. I watched this phenomenon with great interest&mdash;all the more narrowly, because I had nothing to do, but look out for the weather, and the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Agrippina,,,,," id="n0133.0043.00605.01528" reg="mostcommon:Agrippina,nomatch:0"><surname>Agrippina</surname></persName>;</hi> except, indeed, to attend to the refreshment, and recreation of my crew, and send Bartelli on shore, occasionally, with messages to the ladies at the <rs type="place">Government House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7124"/>The reader, who has now been a passenger with us for some time, has watched the trade-winds, as he has crossed the tropics, and has fanned himself and panted for breath, when we have been working our tedious way through the calm-belts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7125"/>He has seen how this system of trade-winds and calm-belts wanders up and down the earth, from north to <name>south</name>, and <name>south</name> to north, drawn hither and thither by the sun. But we have had no conversation, as yet, about the <rs>Equatorial Cloud Ring</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7126"/>He has been, for the last <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, under this very Cloud Ring, but has probably failed to remark it. He has only seen that the flood-gates of the heavens have been raised, and witnessed the descending torrents, and the roll of the thunder, and the play of the lightning, without stopping to ask himself the reason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7127"/>Let us pause a moment, and look into this beautiful phenomenon of the <rs>Equatorial Cloud Ring</rs>, before we flit away to other seas, and are absorbed by new phenomena.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7128"/>The north<name>east</name> and <name>south</name>-east trade-winds, meeting near the equator, produce the <rs>Cloud Ring</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7129"/>Let us suppose the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> back at the crossing of the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> parallel, where, as the reader will recollect, we established the toll-gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7130"/>She had, whilst there, a high barometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7131"/>Starting thence on her way to the equator, as soon as she enters the north-east trade, she finds that her barometer settles a little&mdash;perhaps a <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of an inch on an average.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7132"/>The reader has seen, that we had, whilst passing through this region, a series of half gales, and bad weather; but this was an exceptional state of the atmospheric phenomena.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7133"/><pb id="p.606" n="606"/> The normal condition of the weather is that of a clear sky, with passing trade-clouds, white and fleecy, and with moderate breezes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7134"/>If the reader has watched his barometer narrowly, he has observed a very remarkable phenomenon, which is not known to prevail outside of the trade-wind belts&mdash; an atmospheric tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7135"/>The atmosphere ebbs and flows as regularly as the sea. This atmospheric tide is due, no doubt, to the same cause that produces the aqueous tides&mdash;the attraction of the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7136"/>It occurs twice in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, just like the aqueous tides, and there is no other cause to which we can attribute it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7137"/>The needle has a like semi-diurnal&mdash;indeed, hourly variation&mdash;showing the normal, electrical condition of the atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7138"/>The atmospherical, tidal wave, as it ebbs and flows, seems to carry the needle backward and forward with it. The average barometer being but a very little under <num value="30">thirty</num>, there is an agreeable elasticity in the atmosphere, and officers, and crew are generally in fine spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7139"/>The sailors enjoy their evening dances, and story-tellings, and when the night-watches are set, sleep with impunity about the decks&mdash;guarded, however, by those woollen garments, of which I spoke, when describing our routine life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7140"/>But observe, now, what a change will take place, as we approach the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7141"/>We are approaching not only the calm-belt, which has been before described, but the <rs>Cloud Ring</rs>, for the latter is the concomitant of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7142"/>The winds die away, the muttering of thunder is heard, and a pall of black clouds, along which dart frequent streaks of lightning, is seen hanging on the verge of the horizon, ahead of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7143"/>As she advances, fanned along by puffs of wind from various quarters, she loses sight of the sun altogether, and enters beneath the belt of clouds, where she is at once deluged with rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7144"/>She is at once in the equatorial calm-belt, and under the <rs>Equatorial Cloud Ring</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7145"/>The north-<name>east</name> and <name>south</name>-east trade-winds, as they came sweeping along, charged to saturation with the vapors which they have licked up from a torrid sea, have ascended as they met, and when they have reached the proper dew-point, or point of the wet-bulb of the thermometer, precipitation has commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7146"/>The barometer falls another <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of an inch, or <pb id="p.607" n="607"/> so, all elasticity departs from the atmosphere, and officers and crew lose their cheerfulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7147"/>They feel all the lassitude and weariness of men in a perpetual vapor-bath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7148"/>The sailor no longer mounts the ratlines, as if he had cork in his heels, but climbs up sluggishly and slothfully, devoid of his usual pride to be foremost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7149"/>In other words, though not absolutely sick, he is <q direct="unspecified">under the weather.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7150"/>The rays of the sun being perpetually excluded, the thermometer stands lower under the <rs>Cloud Ring</rs>, than on either side of it. At least this is the normal condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7151"/>Sometimes, however, the most oppressive heats occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7152"/>They are local, and of short duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7153"/>These local heats are occasioned as follows: When a cooler stratum of the upper air sweeps down nearer the earth than usual, bringing with it the dew-point, condensation takes place so near the surface, that the rain-drops have not time to cool, at the same time that an immense quantity of latent heat has been liberated in the act of condensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7154"/>At other times, when the dew-point is far removed from the earth, the latent heat is not only thrown off at a greater distance from us, but the rain-drops cool in their descent, and greatly reduce the temperature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7155"/>The Cloud Ring is being perpetually formed, and is perpetually passing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7156"/>Fresh volumes of air charged as described, are constantly rushing in from the north and from the south, and as constantly ascending, parting with a portion of their water, and continuing their journey to the poles, in obedience to the laws providing for the equal distribution of rain to the <num value="2">two</num> hemispheres, before explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7157"/>The Cloud Ring encircles the entire earth, and if it could be viewed by an eye at a distance from our planet, would appear like a well-defined black mark drawn around an artificial globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7158"/>Its width is considerable, being from <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="6">six</num> degrees.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7159"/>It remains to speak of the offices which this remarkable ring performs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7160"/>It is an important cog-wheel in the great atmospherical machine, for the distribution of water over the earth; but, besides its functions in the general system, it has local duties to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7161"/>These are the hovering by turns over certain portions of the earth, giving them an alternation of rain and sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7162"/>In short, it causes the rainy, and dry seasons, <pb id="p.608" n="608"/> in certain parallels, <name>north</name> and <name>south</name>, within the limits assigned to it. The ancients were of the opinion that the equatorial regions of the earth were a continuous, burning desert, devoid of vegetation, and of course uninhabitable; and perhaps this opinion would not be very far wrong, but for the arrangement of which I am about to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7163"/>The Cloud Ring is a part of the system of calm-belts, and trade-winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7164"/>It overhangs the equatorial calm-belt, as has been stated, and it travels <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> with it. It travels over as much as <num value="20">twenty</num> degrees of latitude&mdash;from about <num value="5">5</num>&deg; S. to <num value="15">15</num>&deg; N., carrying, as before remarked, rain to the regions over which it hovers, and letting in the sunshine upon those regions it has left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7165"/>If the reader will inspect a map, he will find that it extends as far into our hemisphere, as the island of <placeName key="tgn,7005870" n="1.000 1" reg="martinique,north and central america">Martinique</placeName>, in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>. <persName n="Noronha,,Fernando,,,de" id="n0133.0043.00608.01529" reg="expanded:Noronha,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Noronha</surname></persName>, where we are now lying in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, is near its southern limit, being in the latitude of about <num value="4">4</num>&deg; S. <figure id="fig.608"> 
<head></head></figure> <pb id="p.609" n="609"/> The reader has seen that the rainy season was still prevailing, when we arrived at this island, on the <dateStruct value="-04-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>; and that it had begun to pass away, while we still lay there&mdash;the rain and the sunshine playing at <q direct="unspecified"><dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct> showers.</q>

I really wanted nothing&mdash;though I afterward took in a few boat-loads of coal, merely to show the <rs>President</rs> that I was disposed to be civil&mdash; and this consideration, along with the fact, that I had the heaviest guns in the harbor, induced me to be rather careless, I am afraid, in the choice of phraseology, as I penned my despatch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7336"/>We, too, crowded sail, and for a long time it was doubtful which ship was the faster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7337"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> seemed to have found her match at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7343"/>At last the day dawned and still the ship, with the square yards, and white canvas, was <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> ahead of us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7345"/>At <time value="7:30">half past 7</time>&mdash;my usual time for rising&mdash;I heard the report of a gun, and pretty soon afterward an officer came below to say, that the chase proved to be a Dutchman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7369"/>We were under topsails only, standing leisurely across the great highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7370"/>We immediately wore ship, and gave chase, crowding all sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7371"/>When day dawned, the fugitive was some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure> ahead of us, and as the chase was likely to be long, I fired a gun, and hoisted the <rs>Confederate</rs> colors, to intimate to the stranger, that I would like him to be polite, and save me the trouble of catching him, by heaving to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7372"/>But the stranger had faith in his heels, and instead of heaving to, threw out a few more kites to the balmy morning breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7373"/>But it was of no use. Both ships were on a wind, and the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> could, in consequence, use her monster trysails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7374"/>My large double glasses&mdash;themselves captured from a Yankee ship, the captain of which had probably bought them to look out for the <q direct="unspecified">pirate</q>&mdash;soon told the tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7376"/>Still anxious to save time, when we had approached within about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of the stranger, we cleared away our pivot rifle, and let him have a bolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7377"/>We did not quite reach him, but these rifle-bolts make such an ugly whizzing, and hissing, and humming as they pass along, that their commands are not often disobeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7378"/>The stranger <pb id="p.624" n="624"/> clewed up, and backed his main yard, and hoisted the <rs>Federal</rs> colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7391"/>On the following night, a little before daylight, whilst we were lying to, with the main-topsail to the mast, a large, tall ship suddenly loomed up in close proximity to us, and as suddenly passed away into the gloom, gliding past us like a ghost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7392"/>We filled away and made chase on the instant, and being still within gun-shot, fired a blank cartridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7399"/>I desired very much to burn her, but was prevented by the regularity of her papers and the circumstances surrounding her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7447"/>My ship had been constantly reported, and any <num value="1">one</num> of his clerks could have plotted my track, from these reports, so as to show him, past all peradventure, where I was bound.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7449"/>As has been frequently remarked in the course of these pages, the sea has its highways and byways, as well as the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7450"/>Every seaman, now, knows where these highways are, and when he is about to make a voyage, can plot his track in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7451"/>None of these highways are better defined, or perhaps <pb id="p.629" n="629"/> so well defined, as the great public road that leads along the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7455"/>The road thus far is wide&mdash;the ships having a large discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7456"/>But when the road has crossed the equator, and struck into the region of the south-east trades, its limits become much circumscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7457"/>It is as much as a ship can do now, to stretch by the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName> without tacking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7458"/>The south-east trades push her so close down upon the coast, that it is touch and go with her. The road, in consequence, becomes very narrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7459"/>The more narrow the road, the more the stream of ships is condensed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7460"/>A cruiser, under easy sail, stretching backward and forward <hi rend="italics">across</hi> this road, must necessarily get sight of nearly everything that passes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7461"/>If <persName n="Welles,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0045.00629.01594" reg="mostcommon:Welles,Gideon,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Welles</surname></persName> had stationed a heavier and faster ship than the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>&mdash;</hi>and he had a number of both heavier and faster ships&mdash;at the crossing of the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> parallel; another at or near the equator, a little to the eastward of <persName n="Noronha,,Fernando,,,de" id="n0133.0045.00629.01595" reg="expanded:Noronha,Fernando,,,"><foreName>Fernando</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Noronha</surname></persName>, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> off <placeName key="tgn,1001834" n="1.000 11" reg="bahia">Bahia</placeName>, he must have driven me off, or greatly crippled me in my movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7462"/>A few more ships in the other chief highways, and his commerce would have been pretty well protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7463"/>But the old gentleman does not seem once to have thought of so simple a policy as <hi rend="italics">stationing</hi> a ship anywhere.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7466"/>This method of his left the game entirely in my own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7467"/>My safety depended upon a simple calculation of times and distances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7468"/>For instance, when I arrived off the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, I would take up my pencil, and make some such an estimate as this: I discharged my prisoners from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ship captured, on such a <pb id="p.630" n="630"/> day. It will take these prisoners a certain number of days to reach a given port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7469"/>It will take a certain other number of days, for the news of the capture to travel thence to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7470"/>And it will take a certain other number still, for a ship of war of the enemy to reach the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7471"/>Just before this aggregate of days elapses, I haul aft my trysail sheets, and stretch over to the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7472"/>I find no enemy's ship of war awaiting me here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7473"/>I go to work on the stream of commerce doubling the <name>Cape</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7474"/>And by the time, I think, that the ships which have arrived on the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName> in pursuit of me, have heard of my being at the <name>Cape</name>, and started in fresh chase; I quietly stretch back to the coast of <placeName reg="Brasil, South America, " key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, and go to work as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7475"/><hi rend="italics">Voila tout</hi>!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7476"/>We had, some days since, crossed the tropic of Capricorn, and entered the <q direct="unspecified">variables</q> of the southern hemisphere; and having reached the forks of the great Brazilian highway, that is to say, the point at which the stream of commerce separates into <num value="2">two</num> principal branches, <num value="1">one</num> passing around <placeName key="possibilities=34" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Cape Horn</placeName>, and the other around the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>, we had taken the left-hand fork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7477"/>We had not proceeded far on this road, however, before we found upon examination of our bread-room, that the weevil, that pestilent little destroyer of bread-stuffs in southern climates, had rendered almost our entire supply of bread useless!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7480"/>For the next few days, the weather was boisterous and unpleasant&mdash;wind generally from the north-west, with a southeasterly current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7489"/>The trousers and undergarments were all right, however, and of these we got a large supply on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7492"/>No Englishman or Frenchman could possibly own such a cargo, and there was, consequently, no attempt among the papers to protect it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7498"/>She had paid no attention to the burning ship, but flew past it as though she were anxious to get out of harm's way as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7499"/>I conceived thence the idea, that she must be <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's large clipper-ships, from <q direct="unspecified">round the <name>Horn</name>,</q> and immediately gave chase, adding, in my eagerness to seize so valuable a prize, steam to sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7500"/>It was blowing half a gale of wind, but the phantom ship, for such she looked by moonlight, was carrying her royals and top-gallant studding-sails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7501"/>This confirmed my suspicion, for surely, I thought, no ship would risk carrying away her spars, under such a press of sail, unless she were endeavoring to escape from an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7816"/>Here is a letter which the ignorant fellow wrote to the <rs>Governor</rs>, whilst I was still at <placeName reg="Saldanha Bay">Saldanha Bay</placeName>:&mdash; <pb id="p.654" n="654"/> <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7817"/>Sir: From reliable information received by me, and which you are also doubtless in possession of, a war-steamer called the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, is now in <placeName reg="Saldanha Bay">Saldanha Bay</placeName>, being painted, discharging prisoners of war, &amp;c. The vessel in question was built in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, to prey upon the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and escaped therefrom while on her trial-trip, forfeiting bonds of <measure n="20000l." type="pounds">&pound; <num value="20000">20,000</num></measure> (!) which the <rs>British Government</rs> exacted under the <rs>Foreign Enlistment Act</rs>. Now, as your Government has a treaty of amity and commerce with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and has not recognized the persons in revolt against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as a government at all, the vessel alluded to should be at once seized, and sent to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, whence she clandestinely escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7818"/>Assuming that the <rs>British Government</rs> was sincere in exacting the bonds, you have, doubtless, been instructed to send her home to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where she belongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7819"/>But if, from some oversight, you have not received such instructions, and you decline the responsibility of making the seizure, I would most respectfully protest against the vessel remaining in any port of the <name>Colony</name>, another day. She has been at <placeName reg="Saldanha Bay">Saldanha Bay</placeName> <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> already, and a week previously on the coast, and has forfeited all right to remain an hour longer, by this breach of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7820"/>Painting a ship [especially with <name>Yankee</name> paint] does not come under the head of <q direct="unspecified">necessary repairs,</q> and is no proof that she is unseaworthy; and to allow her to visit other ports, after she has set the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation of neutrality at defiance, would not be regarded as in accordance with the spirit and purpose of that document.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7821"/>This letter, in its loose statement of facts, and in its lucid exposition of the laws of nations, would have done credit to <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0046.00654.01717" reg="mostcommon:Seward,William,H.,,:3"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> himself, the head of the department to which this ambitious little Consul belonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7822"/>Instead of a week, the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had been less than a day on the coast, before she ran into <placeName reg="Saldanha Bay">Saldanha Bay</placeName>; and, if she had chosen, she might have cruised on the coast during the rest of the war, in entire conformity with the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation, and the laws of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7823"/>But the richest part of the letter is that wherein the <rs>Consul</rs> tells the <rs>Governor</rs>, that inasmuch as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had not been acknowledged as a nation, they had no right to commission a <term type="ship">ship of war</term> <rs type="ship">It</rs> is astonishing how dull the <rs>Federal</rs> officials, generally, were on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7824"/>The Consul knew that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had acknowledged us to be in possession of belligerent rights, and that the only rights I was pretending to exercise, in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, were those of a belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7831"/>The reports received from <placeName reg="Saldanha Bay">Saldanha Bay</placeName> induce the <rs>Governor</rs> to believe, that the vessel will leave that harbor, as soon as her repairs are completed; but he will immediately, on receiving intelligence to the contrary, take the necessary steps for enforcing the observance of the rules laid down by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7832"/>Another correspondence now sprang up between the <rs>Consul</rs> and the <rs>Governor</rs> in relation to the capture of the <hi rend="italics">Sea-Bride</hi>. The Consul wrote to the <rs>Governor</rs>, as follows:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7835"/>This occurrence at the entrance of <placeName reg="Table Bay, Lake, Montana" key="tgn,2709178">Table Bay</placeName>, and clearly in <name>British</name> waters, is an insult to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and a grievous injury to a friendly power, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7836"/>This remark about the honor of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will remind the reader of the article I quoted some pages back, from the <orgName n="New York Commercial Advertiser" type="newspaper">New York <name>Commercial Advertiser</name></orgName>, to the same effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7837"/>How wonderfully alive these fellows were to <name>English</name> honor, when <name>Yankee</name> ships were in danger!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7838"/>But as the <rs>Consul</rs> admits, upon the testimony of his <q direct="unspecified">own eyes,</q> that the capture was made <hi rend="italics"><num value="4">four</num></hi> miles from the nearest land, the reader will, perhaps, be curious to see how he brings it within <name>British</name> waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7839"/>The marine league is the limit of jurisdiction, and the writers on international law say that that limit was probably adopted, <pb id="p.656" n="656"/> because a cannon-shot could not be thrown farther than <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7840"/>It may have been the cannon-shot which suggested the league, but it was the league, and not the cannot-shot, which was the limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7841"/>Now the <rs>Consul</rs> argued that the <rs>Yankees</rs> had invented some <q direct="unspecified">big guns,</q> which would throw a shot a long way beyond the league&mdash;ergo, the <rs>Yankee</rs> guns had changed the <name>Laws</name> of Nations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7842"/>But the <rs>Consul</rs> wrote his letter in too great a hurry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7843"/>He had not yet seen the master of the captured ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7844"/>This clever <name>Yankee</name>, backed by several of his crew equally clever, made a much better case for him; for they swore, in a batch of affidavits before the <rs>Consul</rs> himself, and in spite of the <rs>Consul</rs>'s <q direct="unspecified">own eyes,</q> that the ship had been captured within <hi rend="italics"><measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure></hi> of <placeName reg="Robbeneiland,Province of the Western Cape,South Africa,Africa" key="tgn,1008785">Robben Island</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7845"/>Imprudent Consul to have thus gone off half cocked!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7846"/>This discovery of new testimony was communicated to the <rs>Governor</rs>, as follows: <q direct="unspecified">I beg now to enclose for your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>'s perusal, the affidavit of <persName n="White,Captain,Charles,F.,," id="n0133.0046.00656.01720" reg="default:White,Charles,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>White</surname></persName>, of the <hi rend="italics">Sea-Bride</hi>, protesting against the capture of the said bark in <name>British</name> waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7847"/>The bearings taken by him at the time of capture, conclusively show that she was in neutral waters, being about <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles">two and a half miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Robbeneiland,Province of the Western Cape,South Africa,Africa" key="tgn,1008785">Robben Island</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7850"/>A fine ship, and a lucrative trading voyage along the eastern coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 4" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> were to be the reward of his testimony; the simple telling of the truth the reward of the other witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7945"/>Lunches on board the different ships, excursions on board the <hi rend="italics">Kwan-<persName><foreName>Tung</foreName></persName></hi>, and dinner-parties were the order of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7956"/>The townspeople humored and spoiled them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7957"/>They all overstayed their time, and we only got them back by twos and threes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7958"/>It was of no use to muster, and inspect them now. The tidy, new suits, in which they had gone on shore, were torn and draggled, and old-drunks were upon nearly all of them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7964"/>It was winter-time, we were off the <q direct="unspecified">stormy Cape,</q> and we had the weather suited to the season and the locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7965"/>Storms and fogs and calms followed in succession&mdash;the storm being the normal meteorological condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7966"/>As we would be lying to, in this track, under reefed sails, in a dark and stormy night, our very hair would sometimes be made to stand on end, by the apparition of a huge ship rushing past us at lightning speed, before the howling gale, at no more than a few ships' lengths from us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7968"/>As we were making this passage, it was reported to me that our fresh-water condenser had given out. Here was a predicament!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7969"/>The water was condensed once a week, and we had no more than about <num value="1">one</num> week's supply on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7970"/>The joints of the piping had worked loose, and the machine had become nearly useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7971"/>It was now still more necessary to make a harbor, where we might get access to water, and see what could be done in the way of repairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7972"/>We worked our way along the <rs type="place">African coast</rs> somewhat tediously, frequently encountering head-winds and adverse currents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7973"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="-08-28"><day reg="28">28th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, we sighted the land, after having been delayed by a dense fog for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, and in the course of the afternoon we ran into the <rs type="place">Bay of Angra Peque</rs>&ntilde;a, and anchored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7974"/>This was our point of rendezvous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7975"/>I found the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName></hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Sea-Bride</hi> both at anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7976"/>I had <pb id="p.666" n="666"/> at last found a port into which I could take a prize!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7977"/>I was now, in short, among the <name>Hottentots</name>; no civilized nation claiming jurisdiction over the waters in which I was anchored.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7978"/>When at <placeName reg="Cape Town,Province of the Western Cape,South Africa,Africa" key="tgn,7000811">Cape Town</placeName>, an English merchant had visited me, and made overtures for the purchase of the <hi rend="italics">Sea-Bride</hi> and her cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7979"/>He was willing to run the risk of non-condemnation by a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize-court</orgName>, and I could put him in possession of the prize, he said, at some inlet on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 4" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, without the jurisdiction of any civilized power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7980"/>I made the sale to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7983"/>The reader will see how easy it would have been for me, to make available many of my prizes in this way, but the great objection to the scheme, was the loss of time which it involved, and the risks I ran of not getting back my prize crews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7984"/>If I had undertaken, whenever I captured a prize, to follow her to some out-of-the-way port, and spend some days there, in negotiating for her sale, and getting back my prize crew, I should not have accomplished half the work I did. The great object now was to destroy, as speedily as possible, the enemy's commerce, and to this I devoted all my energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7985"/>I did not, therefore, repeat the experiment of the <hi rend="italics">Sea-Bride</hi>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7986"/>I could not have chosen a better spot for my present purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7987"/>At Angra Peque&ntilde;a I was entirely out of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7990"/>The region was rainless, and there was not so much as a shrub, or even a blade of grass to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7991"/>The harbor was rock-bound, and for miles inland the country was a waste of burning sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7992"/><pb id="p.667" n="667"/> The harbor did not even afford fresh water, and we were obliged to supply ourselves from the vessel of my <name>English</name> friend, until our condenser could be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7993"/>The whole country was a waste, in which there was no life visible away from the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7994"/>On the coast itself, there were the usual seabirds&mdash;the gannet and the sea-gull&mdash;and fish in abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8038"/>After our return to the drawing-room, the ladies made their appearance, and gave us some delightful music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8039"/>These were some of the oases in the desert of my life upon the ocean.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8040"/>In the course of <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>, by the exercise of great diligence, we were again ready for sea. But unfortunately all my crew were not yet on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8042"/>Some of them had been jugged by the authorities for offences against the peace, and others had yielded to the seductions of the ever vigilant Federal Consul, and been quartered upon his bounty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8043"/>The Consul had made a haul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8044"/>They would be capital fellows for <q direct="unspecified">affidavits</q> against the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. I need not say that they were of the cosmopolitan sailor class, none of them being citizens of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8045"/>I offered large rewards for the apprehension and delivery to me of these fellows; but the police were afraid to act&mdash;probably forbidden by their superiors, in deference to their supposed duty under the neutrality laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8046"/>That was a very <num value="1">one</num>-sided neutrality, however, which permitted the <rs>Federal Consul</rs> to convert his quarters into a hostile camp, for the seduction of my sailors, and denied me access to the police for redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8047"/>My agent at <placeName reg="Cape Town,Province of the Western Cape,South Africa,Africa" key="tgn,7000811">Cape Town</placeName>, having made every exertion in his power to secure the return of as many of my men as possible, finally telegraphed me, on the evening of the <dateStruct value="-09-24"><day reg="24">24th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, that it was useless to wait any longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8048"/>As many as <num value="14">fourteen</num> had deserted; enough to cripple my crew, and that, too, with an enemy's ship of superior force on the coast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8049"/>What was to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8050"/>Luckily there was a remedy at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8051"/>A sailor-landlord, <num value="1">one</num> of those Shylocks who coin <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0047.00670.01764" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>'s flesh and blood into gold, hearing of the distress of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, came off to tell me that all his boarders, <num value="11">eleven</num> in number, had volunteered to supply the place of my deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8052"/>This seemed like a fair exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8053"/>It was but <q direct="unspecified">swapping horses,</q> as the <q direct="unspecified">sainted <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName></q> would have said, if he <pb id="p.671" n="671"/> had been in my place&mdash;only I was giving a little <q direct="unspecified">boot</q>&mdash; <num value="14">fourteen</num> well-fed, well-clothed fellows, for <num value="11">eleven</num> ragged, whiskey-filled vagabonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8054"/>It was a <q direct="unspecified">swap</q> in another sense, too, as, <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, all these <num value="11">eleven</num> fellows were deserters from other ships that had touched at this <q direct="unspecified">relay house</q> of the sea.

There was my good friend, <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name>, the <rs>Queen</rs> &mdash;I must not be ungallant to her, and violate her neutrality laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8055"/>What monstrous sophists we are, when interest prompts us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8056"/>I reasoned out this case to my entire satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8057"/>I said to myself, My sailors have gone on shore in <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> dominions, and refuse to come back to me. When I apply to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> police, they tell me that so sacred is the soil of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, no man must be coerced to do what he does n't want to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8058"/>I reply that a ship of war is a part of the territory to which she belongs, and that if some of the subjects of the <rs>Queen</rs> should think proper to come into my territory, and refuse to go back, I may surely apply the same principle, and refuse to compel them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8059"/>When I had come to this conclusion, I turned to the landlord, and said: <q direct="unspecified">And so you have some <hi rend="italics">gentlemen</hi> boarding at your house, who desire to take passage with me?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8060"/>The landlord smiled, and nodded assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8061"/>I continued: <q direct="unspecified">You know I cannot ship any seamen in <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> ports, but I see no reason why I should not take passengers to sea with me, if they desire to go.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8071"/>It was now <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8072"/>It had been blowing a gale of wind, all day, from the south-east; but it was a fairweather gale, if I may use the solecism; the sky being clear, and the barometer high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8073"/>These are notable peculiarities of the south-east gales at the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8074"/>The sky is always clear, and the gale begins and ends with a high barometer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8075"/>I was very anxious to get to sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8076"/>I need not remark that the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Vanderbilt,,,,," id="n0133.0047.00672.01769" reg="mostcommon:Vanderbilt,nomatch:0"><surname>Vanderbilt</surname></persName></hi> had greatly the speed of me, and threw twice my weight of metal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8077"/>The wind having partially lulled, we got up steam, and at about <time value="11:30">half-past 11</time>, we moved out from our anchors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8078"/>The lull had only been temporary, for we had scarcely cleared the little islands that give a partial protection to the harbor from these south-east winds, when the gale came whistling and howling as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8079"/>The wind and sea were both nearly ahead, and the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was now put upon her metal, under steam, as she had been so often before, under sail.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8081"/>This struggle of the little ship with the elements was a thing to be remembered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8082"/>The moon, as before remarked, was near her full, shedding a flood of light upon the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8083"/>The <rs type="place">Bay</rs> was whitened with foam, as the waters were lashed into fury by the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8084"/>Around the curve of the <q direct="unspecified"><rs n="horse shoe" type="product">horse-shoe</rs></q> arose broken, bald, rocky mountains, on the crests of which were piled fleecy, white clouds, blinking in the moonlight, like banks of snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8085"/>These clouds were perfectly motionless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8087"/>The scene was wild and weird beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8088"/>It was a picture for the eye of a poet or painter to dwell upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8089"/>Nor was the imagination <pb id="p.673" n="673"/> less touched, when, from time to time, the revolving light upon the grim old Cape&mdash;that Cape which had so long divided the <rs>Eastern</rs> from the <rs>Western</rs> world&mdash;threw its full blaze upon the deck of the struggling ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8090"/>Overhead, the sky was perfectly clear, there being not so much as a speck of a cloud to be seen&mdash;and this in the midst of a howling gale of wind!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8091"/>At <time value="3am">three A. M.</time> we cleared the <name>Cape</name>, and keeping the ship off a few points, gave her the trysails, with the bonnets off. She bounded over the seas like a stag-hound unleashed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8137"/>As we approached the <num value="40" type="ordinal">40th</num> parallel of latitude, my attention was again forcibly drawn to the phenomena of the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8138"/>The <q direct="unspecified">Brave West Winds</q>&mdash;as the sailors call them&mdash;those remarkable polar trade-winds, now began to prevail with wonderful regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8139"/>On the <dateStruct value="-09-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, we observed in latitude <num value="39">39</num>&deg; <num value="12">12</num>&prime;, and longitude <num value="31">31</num>&deg; <num value="59">59</num>&prime;.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8145"/>He scatters the icebergs hither and thither to the great terror of the mariner, and converts the moisture of the clouds into the blinding snow-flake or the pelting hail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8146"/>As we are driven, on dark nights, before these furious winds, we have only to imitate the <rs type="place">Cape Horn</rs> navigator&mdash; <quote>tie all fast, and let her rip,</quote> iceberg or no iceberg.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8148"/></p> 
<p>These winds continued to blow from day to day, hurrying us forward with great speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8149"/>There being a clear sweep of the sea for several <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure>, unobstructed by continent or island, the waves rose into long, sweeping swells, much more huge and majestic than <num value="1">one</num> meets with in any other ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8150"/>As our little craft, scudding before a gale, would be overtaken by <num value="1">one</num> of these monster billows, she would be caught up by its crest, like a cock-boat, and darted half-way down the declivity that lay before her, at a speed that would cause the sailor to hold his breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8151"/>Any swerve to the right, or the left, that would cause the ship to <q direct="unspecified">broach to,</q> or come broadside to the wind and sea, would have been fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8152"/>These <q direct="unspecified">brave west winds,</q> though thus fraught with danger, are a great boon to commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8153"/>The reader has seen how the currents in this part of the ocean travel in an ellipse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8154"/>We have here an ellipse of the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8155"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> is hurrying to the <rs>Far East</rs>, before a continuous, or almost continuous north-west gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8156"/>If she were a few <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> to the northward of <pb id="p.679" n="679"/> her present position, she might be hurrying, though not quite with equal speed, before the south-east trades, to the <rs>Far West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8157"/>We have thus <num value="2">two</num> parallel winds blowing all the year round in opposite directions, and only a few <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> apart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8158"/>Storms are now admitted by all seamen to be gyratory, as we have seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8159"/>When I was cruising in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> Stream, I ventured to enlarge this theory, as the reader may recollect, and suggested that rotation was the normal condition of all extra-tropical winds on the ocean, where there was nothing to obstruct them&mdash;of the moderate wind, as well as of the gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8160"/>I had a striking confirmation of this theory in the <q direct="unspecified">brave west winds.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8161"/>These winds went regularly around the compass, in uniform periods; the periods occupying about <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. We would take them at about N. N. W., and in the course of the <q direct="unspecified">period</q> they would go entirely around the compass, and come back to the same point; there being an interval of calm of a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8162"/>The following diagram will illustrate this rotary motion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8163"/>Let Figure <num value="1">1</num>, on the opposite page, represent a circular wind &mdash;the wind gyrating in the direction of the arrows, and the circle travelling at the same time, along the dotted lines from west to east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8164"/>If the northern segment of this circular wind passes over the ship, the upper dotted line from A to A2, will represent her position during its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8165"/>At A, where the ship <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> takes the wind, she will have it from about northwest; and at A2, where she is about to lose it, she will have it from about south-west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8166"/>The ship is supposed to remain stationary, whilst the circle is passing over her. Now, this is precisely the manner in which we found all these winds to haul in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. We would have the wind from the north-west to the south-west, hauling gradually from <num value="1">one</num> point to the other, and blowing freshly for the greater part of tree days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8167"/>It would then become light, and, in the course of a few hours, go round to the south, to the south-east, to the east, and then settle in the north-west, as before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8168"/>Figure <num value="2">2</num> represents <num value="2">two</num> of these circular winds&mdash;and the reader must recollect that there is a constant series of them&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> following the other so closely as to overlap it. Now, if the reader will cast his eye upon the letter C, near the upper <pb id="p.680" n="680"/> <figure id="fig.680"> 
<head></head></figure> <pb id="p.681" n="681"/> dotted line, in the overlapped space, he will observe why it is, that there is always a short interval of calm before the northwest wind sets in, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8169"/>The wind within that space is blowing, or rather should blow, according to the theory, <num value="2">two</num> opposite ways at once&mdash;from the N. N. W., and the <rs>S. S. E. The</rs> consequence is, necessarily, a calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8170"/>It is thus seen that the theory, that these <q direct="unspecified">brave west winds</q> are a series of circular winds, harmonizes entirely with the facts observed by us. The lower dotted line is merely intended to show in what direction the wind would haul, if the southern segment, instead of the northern, passed over the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8171"/>In that case, the ship would take the wind, from about N. N. E., as at B, and lose it at south-east, as at B2. in the region of the <q direct="unspecified">brave west winds,</q> it would seem that the northern segment always passes over that belt of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8172"/>The received theory of these south polar-winds, is not such as I have assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8173"/>Former writers have not supposed them to be circular winds at all. They suppose them to pass over the southeast trade-winds, as an upper current, and when they have reached the proper parallel, to descend, become surface-winds, and blow home, as straight winds, to the pole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8174"/>But I found a difficulty in reconciling this theory with the periodical veering of the wind entirely around the compass, as above described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8175"/>If these were straight winds, blowing contrary to the trades, why should they not blow steadily like the trades?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8176"/>but if we drop the straight-wind theory, and take up the circular hypothesis, all the phenomena observed by us will be in conformity with the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8177"/>The periodical hauling of the wind will be accounted for, and if we suppose that the northern half of the circle invariably passes over the ship, in the passageparallels, we shall see how it is that the wind is blowing nearly all the time from the westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8178"/>To account for the fact that the northern half of the circle invariably passes over these parallels, we have only to suppose the circle to be of sufficient diameter to extend to, or near the pole.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8179"/>here is the figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8180"/>It extends from the parallel of <num value="40">40</num>&deg;, to the pole; it is therefore <num value="50">fifty</num> degrees, or <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure>, in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8181"/>Half-way from its northern to its southern edge, would be the <num value="65" type="ordinal">65th</num> parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8182"/>Along this parallel, represented <pb id="p.682" n="682"/> by the dotted line, which passes through the centre of the cir. Cle, the vortex, V, or calm spot, would travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8183"/>There should be calms, therefore, about the <num value="65" type="ordinal">65th</num> parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8184"/>In the southern half of the circle, or that portion of it between the vortex and the pole, easterly winds should prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8185"/>Navigators between the parallels of <num value="65">65</num>&deg; and <num value="75">75</num>&deg;, speak of calms as the normal meteorological condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8186"/>All nature seems frozen to death, the winds included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8187"/>Unfortunately, we have no reliable data for the parallels beyond, and do not know, therefore, whether easterly winds are the prevalent winds or not. It is probable, as we approached the pole, that we should find another calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8188"/>The winds, [see the arrows,] as they come hurrying along the circle, from its northern segment, bring with them an impetus <hi rend="italics">toward</hi> the east, derived from the diurnal motion of the earth, on its axis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8189"/>As these winds approach the pole, this velocity increases, in consequence of the diminishing diameter of the parallels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8190"/>To illustrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8191"/>If a particle of air on the equator, having a velocity eastward of <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> per hour&mdash;and this is the rate of the revolution of the earth on its axis&mdash; should be suddenly transported to a point, distant <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from the pole, it would have sufficient velocity to carry it entirely around the pole in <num value="1">one</num> hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8192"/>Here we have <num value="2">two</num> forces acting in opposition to each other&mdash;the impetus of the wind <hi rend="italics">toward</hi> the east, given to it by the diurnal motion of the earth, <figure id="fig.682"> 
<head></head></figure> <pb id="p.683" n="683"/> and an impetus from the east, given to it by whatever causes are hurrying it around the circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8193"/>These <num value="2">two</num> forces necessarily neutralize each other, and a calm is the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8194"/>It is in this calm region near the poles, that the winds probably ascend, to take their flight back to the equator, in obedience to that beautiful arrangement for watering the earth, which I described some pages back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8195"/>There remains but <num value="1">one</num> other fact to be reconciled with our theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8196"/>It has been seen that consecutive circles of wind passed over the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, in periods of <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8197"/>Did this time correspond with the known rate of travel of the circles?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8198"/>Almost precisely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8199"/>Referring again to the last diagram, it will be remembered that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was near the northern edge of the circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8200"/>Let A A represent her position at the beginning and end of each wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8201"/>The chord of the segment, represented by the dotted line, is about <measure n="1500miles" type="distance">1500 miles</measure> in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8202"/>The circles travel at the rate of about <measure n="20miles" type="distance">20 miles</measure> per hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8203"/>Multiply the number of hours&mdash;<num value="72">72</num>&mdash;in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, by <num value="20">20</num>, and we shall have <measure n="1440miles" type="distance">1440 miles</measure>. It is not pretended, of course, that these figures are strictly accurate, but they are sufficiently so to show, at least, that there is no discordance between the fact and the theory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8204"/>Soon after leaving the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>, the storm-birds began to gather around us in considerable numbers&mdash;the <name>Cape</name> pigeon, the albatross, and occasionally the tiny petrel, so abundant in the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">North Atlantic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8205"/>These birds seemed to be quite companionable, falling in company with the ship, and travelling with her for miles at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8206"/>On the occasion of <num value="1">one</num> of the short calms described, we caught an albatross, with hook and line, which measured <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> across the wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8207"/>The monster bird was very fat, and it was quite a lift to get it inboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8208"/>Though very active on the wing, and rising with great facility from the water, in which it sometimes alights, it lay quite helpless when placed upon the deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8209"/>It did not seem to be much alarmed at the strangeness of its position, but looked at us with the quiet dignity and wisdom of an owl, as though it; would interrogate us as to what we were doing in its dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8210"/>These birds live in the midst of the great <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of miles away from any land&mdash;only making periodical <pb id="p.684" n="684"/> visits to some of the desert islands; or, it may be, to the <rs>Antarctic Continent</rs>, to incubate and rear their young.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8211"/>I have described at some length the nature of the great circles of wind which form the normal meteorological condition of the region of ocean through which we were passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8212"/>This normal condition was sometimes interfered with by the passage of cyclones of smaller diameter&mdash;a circle within a circle; both circles, however, obeying the same laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8213"/>We took <num value="1">one</num> of these cyclones on the <dateStruct value="-10-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8214"/>I do not design to repeat, here, the description of a cyclone, and only refer to that which we now encountered, for the purpose of showing that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> ran a race with it, and was not very badly beaten</hi>. This race is thus described in my journal: Morning dull, cloudy, and cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8215"/>The wind hauled, last night, to north, and is blowing a fresh breeze at <time value="12pm">noon</time>. Barometer, <num value="30.14">30.14</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8216"/>Thermometer, air <num value="54">54</num>&deg;, water <num value="60">60</num>&deg;. Current during the last twentyfour hours, <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8217"/>The weather continued to thicken in the afternoon, and the wind to increase, with a falling barometer, indicating the approach of a gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8218"/>At <time value="9pm">nine P. M.</time>, the squalls becoming heavy, we furled the top-gallant sails and foresail, close-reefed the topsails, and took the bonnets off the trysails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8219"/>Under this reduced sail we continued to scud the ship all night&mdash;the barometer still falling, the wind increasing, and a heavy sea getting up. We had entered the north eastern edge of a cyclone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8220"/>The next morning the wind was still north by west, having hauled only a single point in <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>; showing that we had been running, neck and neck, with the gale.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8221"/>If the reader will recollect that, in these circular gales, the change of the wind is due to the passage of the circle over the ship, he will have no difficulty in conceiving that, if the ship travels as fast as the circle, and in the same direction, the wind will not change at all. Now, as the wind had changed but a single point in <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>, it is evident that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had been travelling nearly as fast as the circular gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8222"/>The race continued all the next day&mdash;the wind not varying half a point, and the barometer settling by scarcely perceptible degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8223"/>Toward night, however, the barometer began to settle quite rapidly, and the wind increased, and began to haul <pb id="p.685" n="685"/> to the westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8224"/>The gale had acquired accelerated speed, and was now evidently passing ahead of us quite rapidly; for by <time value="4:30">half-past 4</time> A. M. the wind was at west, having hauled nearly a quadrant in <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure>. At this point we had the lowest barometer, <num value="29.65">29.65</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8225"/>The centre of the storm was then just abreast of us, bearing about south, and distant perhaps a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure>. At <time value="5am">five A. M.</time>, or in half an hour afterward, the wind shifted suddenly from W. to W. S. W., showing that the vortex had passed us, and that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> was at last beaten!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8226"/>The wind being still somewhat fresher than I desired, I hove the ship to, on the port tack, to allow the gale to draw farther ahead of me. After lying to <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, the barometer continuing to rise, and the wind to moderate, we filled away, and shaking out some of the reefs, continued on our course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8227"/>On the <dateStruct value="-10-12"><day reg="12">12th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, we passed the remarkable islets of <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>, a sort of half-way mile posts between the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs> and the <rs type="place">Strait of Sunda</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8228"/>These islets are the tops of rocky mountains, shooting up from great depths in the sea. They are in the midst of a dreary waste of waters, having no other land within a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> and more, of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8229"/>They are composed of solid granite, without vegetation, and inhabited only by the wild birds of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8230"/>I cannot imagine a more fitting station for a meteorologist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8233"/>These islands are frequently sighted by India-bound ships, and it was my intention to cruise a few days in their vicinity, but the bad weather hurried me on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8234"/>We took another gale, on the night after leaving them, and had some damage done to our head-rail and <num value="1">one</num> of our quarter-boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8235"/>The scene was a sublime <num value="1">one</num> to look upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8236"/>The seas&mdash;those long swells before described&mdash;were literally running mountains high, the wind was howling with more than <pb id="p.686" n="686"/> usual fury, and a dense snow-storm was pelting us from the blackest and most angry-looking of clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8237"/>I was now in longitude <num value="83">83</num>&deg; E., and bore away more to the northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8238"/>Although the thermometer had not settled below <num value="50">50</num>&deg;, we felt the cold quite piercingly&mdash;our clothing being constantly saturated with moisture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8239"/>On the <dateStruct value="-10-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, we had the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tolerably fine day we had experienced for the last <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, and we availed ourselves of it, to uncover the hatches and ventilate the ship, getting up from below, and airing the damp bedding and mildewed clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8240"/>The constant straining of the ship, in the numerous gales she had encountered, had opened the seams in her bends, and all our state-rooms were leaking more or less, keeping our beds and clothing damp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8241"/>On the next day, another gale overtook us, in which we lay to <measure n="10hours" type="date">ten hours</measure>, to permit it, as we had done the gale we ran the race with, to pass ahead of us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8242"/>And thus it was, that we ran down our easting, in the region of the <q direct="unspecified">brave west winds,</q> with every variety of bad weather, of the description of which, the reader must, by this time, be pretty well tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8249"/>We took the tradewind from about S. S. E. almost immediately after crossing the tropic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8250"/>We thus had the good fortune, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, to cross the tropic without finding a calm-belt; the <num value="2">two</num> counter-winds blowing almost side by side with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8319"/>The boatmen had no suspicion that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had captured the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Racer,,Winged,,," id="n0133.0049.00692.01788" reg="default:Racer,Winged,,,"><foreName>Winged</foreName> <surname>Racer</surname></persName></hi>, and was about to destroy her.

Terror at once took possession of the <name>Malay</name> boatmen, and such a cutting of lines, and shouting, and vigorous pulling were perhaps never before witnessed in the <rs type="place">Strait of Sunda</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8320"/>These boats had informed us that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Wyoming" key="tgn,7007923">Wyoming</placeName></hi> was at Anger only <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before, when they left.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8321"/>It was now about <time value="2am">two o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8322"/>We had thus lighted a bonfire at either end of the renowned old Strait of Sunda.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8323"/>After having thus advertised our presence in this passage, it was useless to remain in it longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8324"/>Ships approaching it would take the alarm, and seek some other outlet into the <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8325"/>Most of the ships coming down the <rs type="place">China Sea</rs>, with a view of passing out at the <pb id="p.693" n="693"/> Strait of Sunda, come through the <rs type="place">Gaspar Strait</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8326"/>I resolved now to steam in the direction of this latter strait, and forestall such as might happen to be on their way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8327"/>We had lost the beautiful blue waters of the <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName>, with its almost unfathomable depths, and entered upon a sea whose waters were of a whitish green, with an average depth of no more than about <num value="20">twenty</num> fathoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8328"/>Finding that I should be up with <placeName reg="Gaspar Strait">Gaspar Strait</placeName>, sometime during the night, if I continued under steam, and preferring to delay my arrival until daylight the next morning, I let my steam go down, and put my ship under sail, to take it more leisurely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8329"/>We were about to lift the propeller out of the water, when the cry of <q direct="unspecified">sail ho</q> came from the vigilant look-out at the mast-head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8330"/>We at once discontinued the operation, not knowing but we might have occasion to use steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8331"/>As the stranger was standing in our direction, we soon raised her from the deck, and as my glass developed, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num>, and then another of her features, it was evident that here was another clippership at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8332"/>She had the well-known tall, raking masts, square yards, and white canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8333"/>She was on a wind, with everything set, from courses to skysails, and was ploughing her way through the gently ruffled sea, with the rapidity, and at the same time, the grace of the swan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8334"/>We made her a point or <num value="2">two</num> on our lee bow, and not to excite her suspicion we kept away for her, so gradually, that she could scarcely perceive the alteration in our course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8335"/>We hoisted at the same time the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8336"/>When we were within about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of the chase, she responded by showing us the same colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8337"/>Feeling now quite sure of her, we fired a gun, hauled down the enemy's flag, and threw our own to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8338"/>(We were now wearing that splendid white flag, with its cross and stars, which was so great an improvement upon the old <num value="1">one</num>.) So far from obeying the command of our gun, the gallant ship kept off a point or <num value="2">two</num>-probably her best point of sailing&mdash; gave herself top&mdash;gallant and topmast studding-sails, and away she went!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8339"/><pb id="p.694" n="694"/></p> 
<p>I had been a little premature in my eagerness to clutch so beautiful a prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8340"/>She was not &mdash; as yet under my guns, and it was soon evident that she would give me trouble before I could overhaul her. The breeze was tolerably fresh, but not stiff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8341"/>We made sail at once in chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8342"/>Our steam had been permitted to go down, as the reader has seen; and as yet we had not much more than enough to turn over the propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8343"/>The chase was evidently gaining on us. It was some <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> before the engineer had a head of steam on. We now gave the ship all steam, and trimmed the sails to the best possible advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8344"/>Still the fugitive ship retained her distance from us, if she did not increase it. It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had appeared dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8345"/>She was under both sail and steam, and yet here was a ship threatening to run away from her. She must surely be out of trim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8346"/>I tried, therefore, the effect of getting my crew aft on the quarter-deck, and shifting aft some of the forward guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8347"/>This helped us visibly, and the ship sprang forward with increased speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8348"/>We were now at least holding our own, but it was impossible to say, as yet, whether we were gaining an inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8349"/>If the breeze had freshened, the chase would have run away from us beyond all question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8350"/>I watched the signs of the weather anxiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8351"/>It was between <time value="9">nine</time> and <time value="10am">ten o'clock A. M.</time> Fortunately, as the sun gained power, and drove away the mists of the morning, the breeze began to decline!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8352"/>Now came the triumph of steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8353"/>When we had come within long range, I threw the spray over the quarter-deck of the chase, with a rifle-shot from my bowchaser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8354"/>Still she kept on, and it was not until all hope was evidently lost, that the proud clipper-ship, which had been beaten rather by the failure of the wind, than the speed of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, shortened sail and hove to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8355"/>When the captain was brought on board, I congratulated him on the skilful handling of his ship, and expressed my admiration of her fine qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8356"/>He told me that she was <num value="1">one</num> of the most famous clipper-ships out of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8358"/>She was light, and in fine sailing trim, having only a partial cargo on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8359"/>There being no attempt to cover the cargo, consisting mostly of light <rs n="japanese goods" type="product">Japanese goods</rs>, lacker-ware, and <pb id="p.695" n="695"/> curiosities, I condemned both ship and cargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8360"/>I was sorry to be obliged to burn this beautiful ship, and regretted much that I had not an armament for her, that I might commission her as a cruiser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8361"/>Both ships now anchored in the open sea, with no land visible, in <num value="14">fourteen</num> fathoms of water, whilst the crew was being removed from the prize, and the necessary preparations made for burning her. It was after nightfall before these were all completed, and the torch applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8362"/>We hove up our anchor, and made sail by the light of the burning ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8363"/>Having now burned a ship off <placeName reg="Gaspar Strait">Gaspar Strait</placeName>, I turned my ship's head to the eastward, with the intention of taking the <rs type="place">Carimata Strait</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8364"/>My coal was running so short, by this time, that I was obliged to dispense with the use of steam, except on emergencies, and work my way from point to point wholly under sail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8365"/>Fortune favored me however, for I passed through the <rs type="place">Carimata Strait</rs> in the short space of <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure> against the northwest monsoon, which was a head-wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8366"/>Ships have been known to be <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> making this passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8367"/>I generally anchored at night, on account of the currents, and the exceeding difficulty of the navigation&mdash;shoals besetting the navigator on every hand in this shallow sea. We began now to fall in with some of the curiosities of the <rs type="place">China Sea</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8368"/>Salt-water serpents made their appearance, playing around the ship, and cutting up their antics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8369"/>These snakes are from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> long, and when ships anchor at night, have been known to crawl up the cables, and make their way on deck through the hawse-holes, greatly to the annoyance of the sailors who chance to be sleeping on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8370"/>They are not known to be poisonous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8371"/>Never having been in the <rs type="place">China seas</rs> before, I was quite amused at the gambols of these minature sea-serpents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8372"/>Seeing an old sailor stopping up the hawse-holes, with swabs, <num value="1">one</num> evening after we had anchored, I asked him what he was about.

<p>Naked Malays frequently paddled off to us, when we anchored near their villages, with fowls, and eggs, and fruits, <pb id="p.696" n="696"/> and vegetables, which they desired to exchange for rice and ship-bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8377"/>In frail piraguas, these amphibious bipeds will make long voyages from island to island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8378"/>They seem to be a sort of wandering Arabs of the sea, and, as a rule, are a great set of villains, not hesitating to take a hand at piracy when opportunity offers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8379"/>So intricate are some of the archipelagos which they inhabit, that it is next to impossible to track them to their hiding-places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8380"/>These nomads, upon whom no civilization seems to make any impression, will probably long remain the pests of the <rs type="place">China seas</rs>, in spite of the steamship.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8432"/>To add to the perplexity of the navigator, days sometimes elapse, especially when the monsoons are changing, during which it is impossible to get an observation for fixing the position of his ship; and during these days of incessant darkness, and drenching rains, he is hurried about by currents, he knows not whither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8434"/>I lost many nights of rest when in these seas, and felt much relieved when the time came for me to turn my back upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8437"/>It soon became apparent that it would be useless to attempt operations here, unless assisted by steam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8438"/>Every chase would probably carry us miles to leeward, whence it would be impossible, under sail alone, to regain our position.

<p>At the end of this short cruise, we made sail for the island of Condore, or, as it is called on the charts of the <rs type="place">China Sea</rs>, Pulo Condore, the word <q direct="unspecified">pulo</q> being the <name>Chinese</name> term for island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8441"/>My intention was to run into this small island, which has a snug harbor, sheltered from the monsoon, do some necessary repairs with my own mechanics, refit and repaint, and then run down to <placeName reg="Singapore, Singapore, Singapore" key="tgn,7001488">Singapore</placeName>, and fill up with coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8442"/>My future course would be guided by contingencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8443"/>We made Pulo Condore early in the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="-12-2"><day reg="2">second</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and passing to the northward of the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="possibilities=68" n="1.000 10" reg=",">White Rock</placeName>,</q> bore up, and ran along the western side of the island until nightfall, when we anchored under the lee of a small, rocky island, near the mouth of the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8444"/>The scenery was bold, picturesque, and impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8445"/>All was novelty; the shallow sea, the whistling monsoon, and the little islands rising so abruptly from the sea, that a goat could scarcely clamber up their sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8446"/>The richest vegetation covered these islands from the sea-level to their summits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8447"/>Occasionally a break or gap in the mountain&mdash;for Pulo Condore rises to the height of a mountain&mdash;disclosed charming ravines, opening out into luxuriant plains, where were grazing the wild cattle of the country&mdash;the bison, or small-humped buffalo of the <rs>East</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8448"/>At daylight the next morning, upon looking into the harbor with our glasses, we were surprised to see a small vessel at anchor, wearing the <rs>French</rs> flag; and pretty soon afterward we were boarded by a French boat; Pulo Condore&mdash;lying off the coast of <persName n="China,,Cochin,,," id="n0133.0049.00700.01796" reg="default:China,Cochin,,,"><foreName>Cochin</foreName> <surname>China</surname></persName>&mdash;having recently become a French colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8460"/>I found him as good as his word, with reference to my playing Rajah, for he did not so much as mention to me, once, any rule limiting the stay of belligerents in <name>French</name> waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8461"/>We now got under way, and stood in to the anchorage, the <rs>French</rs> officer kindly consenting to show me the way in; though there was but little need, as the harbor was quite free from obstructions, except such as were plainly visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8462"/>The water in this cosy little harbor was as smooth as a mill-pond, notwithstanding occasional gusts of the monsoon swept down the mountain sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8463"/>There were mountains on <num value="2">two</num> sides of us, both to the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8464"/>The harbor was, in fact, formed by <num value="2">two</num> mountainous islands, both passing under the name of Condore; there being only a boat-passage separating them on the east.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8470"/>The Governor of the island now came on board to visit us. He had his headquarters at a small Malay village on the east coast, where, by the aid of a sergeant's guard, he ruled his subjects with despotic sway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8477"/>The northeast monsoon having now fairly set in, the weather had become fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8478"/>The heat was very great, it is true, but it was much tempered by the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8479"/>During the <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> that we remained in the island, almost every part of it was explored by my adventurous hunters&mdash;even the very mountain tops&mdash;and marvellous were the reports of their adventures which they brought on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8480"/>Some small specimens of deer were found; the bison&mdash;the bull of which is very savage, not hesitating to assault the hunter, under favorable circumstances&mdash;abounded on the small savannas; monkeys travelled about in troops; parrots, and other birds of beautiful plumage, wheeled over our heads in flocks&mdash;in short, the whole island seemed teeming with life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8481"/>The natives told us that there were many large, and some poisonous serpents in the jungles, but fortunately none of my people were injured by them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8482"/>We found here the famous vampyre of the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8483"/>Several specimens were shot, and brought on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8484"/>Some of these monster bats measure from <num value="5">five</num> to <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> from tip to tip of wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8485"/>The head resembles that of a wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8490"/>Imagine my surprise when I found it a piece of wood!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8491"/>It had been plucked fresh from <pb id="p.703" n="703"/> the tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8492"/>The size, shape, and color&mdash;a rich brown&mdash;were all perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8493"/>It was not a capsule or a seed-pod, but a solid piece of wood, with the ordinary woody fibre, and full of sap. I put it away carefully among my curiosities, but after a few days it shrivelled, and lost its beauty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8494"/>The apes did not appear to be afraid of the gun&mdash;probably because they were not accustomed to be shot at. They would cluster around a hunting-party, and grin and chatter like so many old negroes, <num value="1">one</num> sometimes sees on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 4" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8495"/><num value="1">One</num> of the midshipmen having shot <num value="1">one</num>, described the death of the old gentleman to me, and said that he felt almost as if he had killed his old <q direct="unspecified">uncle</q> on his father's plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8496"/>The wounded creature&mdash;whatever it may be, man or animal&mdash; threw its arms over the wound, and moaned as plaintively and intelligibly as if it had been gifted with the power of speech, and were upbraiding its slayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8497"/>During our stay I made the acquaintance&mdash;through my opera-glass&mdash;of several of these lampoons upon human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8498"/>A gang of apes, old and young, came down to the beach regularly every morning, to look at the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8499"/>The old men and women would seat themselves in rows, and gaze at us, sometimes for an hour, without changing their places or attitudes&mdash;seeming to be absorbed in wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8500"/>I became quite familiar with some of their countenances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8501"/>The young people did not appear to be so strongly impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8502"/>They would walk about the beach in twos and threes&mdash;making love, most likely, and settling future family arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8503"/>The children, meanwhile, would be romping around the old people, screaming and barking in very delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8504"/>If a boat approached them, the old people would give a peculiar whistle, when the younger members of the tribe would betake themselves at once to the cover of the adjoining jungle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8505"/>A hunting party, landing here <num value="1">one</num> morning, shot <num value="1">one</num> of these old apes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8506"/>The rest scampered off, and were seen no more that day. The next morning, upon turning my operaglass upon the beach, I saw the monkeys as usual, but they were broken into squads, and moving about in some disorder, instead of being seated as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8507"/>I could plainly see some of them at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8508"/>Some appeared to be digging in the sand, and others to be bringing twigs and leaves of trees, and such of the <pb id="p.704" n="704"/> debris of the forest as they could gather conveniently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8509"/>It was my usual hour for landing, to get sights for my chronometers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8510"/>As the boat approached, the whole party disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8511"/>I had the curiosity to walk to the spot, to see what these semi-human beings had been doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8512"/>They had been burying their dead comrade, and had not quite finished covering up the body, when they had been disturbed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8513"/>The deceased seemed to have been popular, for a large concourse had come to attend his funeral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8514"/>The natives told us, that this burial of the monkeys was a common practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8515"/>They believe in monkey doctors, too, for they told us that when they have come upon sick monkeys in the woods, they have frequently found some demure old fellows looking very wise, with their fingers on their noses sitting at their bed-sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8516"/>The ladies may be curious to know, from the same good authority, how the monkeys of Pulo Condore treat their women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8517"/>As among the <rs type="place">Salt Lake</rs> saints, polygamy prevails, and there are sometimes as many as a dozen females <q direct="unspecified">sealed</q> to <num value="1">one</num> old patriarch&mdash;especially if he be broad across the shoulders, and have sharp teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8518"/>The young lady monkeys are required to form matrimonial connections during the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> or <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> season of their belledom; that is to say, the parent monkeys will permit their daughters to sally out and return home as often as they please, after they have <q direct="unspecified">come out,</q> until <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> moons have elapsed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8520"/>I was frequently startled, whilst we lay at Pulo Condore, at hearing what appeared to be the whistle of a locomotiverather shrill, it may be, but very much resembling it. It proceeded from an enormous locust.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8529"/>We found our ship so much out of order, that it required <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> to get her ready for sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8568"/>No ship could get a freight, and the commerce of the enemy was as dead, for the time being, as if every ship belonging to him had been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8569"/>We had here the key to the mystery, that the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had encountered no American ship, in the <rs type="place">China Sea</rs>, since she had burned the <hi rend="italics">Contest</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8570"/>This state of things decided my future course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8571"/>I had, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, thought of running up the <rs type="place">China Sea</rs>, as far as <placeName reg="Shanghai, Shanghai Shi, Zhonghua" key="tgn,7023856">Shanghai</placeName>, but if there were no more than half a dozen of the enemy's ships to be found in that part of the sea, and these had all fled to neutral ports for protection, <hi rend="italics">cui bono</hi>? It would be far better to return to the western hemisphere, where the enemy still had some commerce left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8572"/>Indeed, my best chance of picking up these very ships, that were now anchored under my guns in <placeName reg="Singapore, Singapore, Singapore" key="tgn,7001488">Singapore</placeName>, and disconsolate for want of something to do, would be to waylay them on their homeward voyages.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8574"/>I had another powerful motive influencing me. My ship was getting very much out of repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8575"/>The hard usage to which she had been subjected since she had been commissioned had very much impaired her strength, and so constantly had she been under way, that the attrition of the water had worn the copper on her bottom so thin that it was daily loosening and dropping off in sheets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8576"/>Her speed had, in consequence, been much diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8577"/>The fire in her furnaces, like that of the fire-worshipping Persian, had never been permitted to go out, except for a few hours at rare intervals, to enable the engineer to clink his bars, and remove the incrustations of salt from the bottoms of his boilers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8578"/>This constant action of fire and salt had nearly destroyed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8579"/>I resolved, therefore, to turn my ship's head westward from <placeName reg="Singapore, Singapore, Singapore" key="tgn,7001488">Singapore</placeName>, run up into the <placeName reg="Bay of Bengal" key="tgn,1112667">Bay of Bengal</placeName>, along the coast of Hindostan to <placeName key="tgn,7001518" n="1.000 2" reg="bombay,salsette island,maharashtra,bharat,asia">Bombay</placeName>, <pb id="p.710" n="710"/> through the <rs type="place">Seychelle Islands</rs> to the mouth of the <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName>, thence to the <rs type="place">Comoro Islands</rs>; from these latter to the <rs type="place">Strait of Madagascar</rs>, and from the latter Strait to the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs>&mdash;thus varying my route back to the <name>Cape</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8581"/>After she had hauled alongside of the coaling wharf, crowds gathered to look curiously upon her, and compare her appearance with what they had read of her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8684"/>This the master declined to do.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8685"/>I could not but admire the beautiful, <hi rend="italics"><q direct="unspecified">bran new</q></hi> <name>English</name> flag, as I pulled on board, but, as before remarked, every line of the ship was American&mdash;her long, graceful hull, with flaring bow, and rounded stern, taunt masts with sky-sail poles, and square yards for spreading the largest possible quantity of canvas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8686"/>Passing up the side, I stepped upon deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8687"/>Here everything was, if possible, still more American, even to the black, greasy cook, who, with his uncovered woolly head, naked breast, and uprolled sleeves in the broiling sun, was peeling his <name>Irish</name> potatoes for his codfish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8688"/>I have before remarked upon the national features of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8690"/>The master received me at the gangway, and, after I had paused to take a glance at things on deck, I proceeded with him into his cabin, where his papers were to be examined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8691"/>His mates were standing about the companion-way, anxious, of course, to know the fate of their ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8692"/>If I had had any doubts <pb id="p.717" n="717"/> before, the unmistakable persons of these men would have removed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8693"/>In the person of the master, the long, lean, angular-featured, hide-bound, weather-tanned <name>Yankee</name> skipper stood before me. <placeName reg="Puritan, Santa Fe, New Mexico" key="tgn,2601474">Puritan</placeName>, <hi rend="italics"><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>-Flower</hi>, <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName>, were all written upon the well-known features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8696"/>When he told me that I <q direct="unspecified">hadn't-ought-to</q> burn his ship, he pronounced the shibboleth which condemned her to the flames.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8698"/>When the papers were produced, I found among them no bill of sale or other evidence of the transfer of the property&mdash;the register of an English ship, as every seaman knows, not being such evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8699"/>His crew list, which had been very neatly prepared, was a mute but powerful witness against him. It was written, throughout, signatures and all in the same hand&mdash;the signatures all being as like as <num value="2">two</num> peas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8700"/>After glancing at the papers, and making these mental observations as I went along, I asked the master a few questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8701"/>As well as I recollect, he was from <placeName reg="Hallowell, Kennebec, Maine" key="tgn,2044926">Hallowell, Maine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8703"/>The freshly painted assumed name on her stern was scarcely dry.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8705"/>The cargo was <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> <name>English</name> property, and if the owner of it, instead of combining with the master of the ship to perpetrate a fraud upon my belligerent rights, had contented himself with putting it on board under the <rs>American</rs> flag, properly documented as <name>British</name> property, he might have saved it, and along with it, the ship; as, in that case, I should have been obliged to bond her. But when I had stripped off the disguise, and the ship stood forth as American, unfortunately for the owner of the cargo, no document could be presented to show that it was <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0133.0050.00718.01817" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>; for the very attempt to document it would have exposed the fraud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8800"/>This matter of business accomplished, the natives came off to visit us, in considerable numbers, both men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8801"/>They were a fine, well-formed, rather athletic people, nearly as black as the negro, but with straight hair and prominent features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8802"/>Very few of them wore any other dress than a cloth about the loins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8804"/>Some of the young women had very regular and pleasing features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8805"/>The best description I can give of them is to request the reader to imagine some belle of his <pb id="p.725" n="725"/> acquaintance to be divested of those garments which would be useless to her in Anjenga&mdash;latitude <num value="8">8</num>&deg;&mdash;and instead of charming him with the lily and the rose, to be shining in lustrous jet.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8807"/>These mountains will be lost to our view to-morrow; but before they dis appear, I have a word to say concerning them, and the fertile country of Hindostan, in which they are situated; for nature elaborates here <num value="1">one</num> of her most beautiful and useful of meteorological problems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8808"/><placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">British India</placeName> is the most formidable competitor of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> for the production of cotton, for the supply of the spindles and looms of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8809"/>The problem to which I wish to call the reader's attention may be stated thus:&mdash;<hi rend="italics">The <rs>Great Deserts</rs> of <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242"><rs type="direction">Central</rs> Africa</placeName> produce the cotton crop of Hindostan</hi>. I have before had frequent occasion to speak of the monsoons of the <rs>East</rs>&mdash;those periodical winds that blow for <num value="0.5">one half</num> of the year from <num value="1">one</num> point of the compass, and then change, and blow the other half of the year from the opposite point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8810"/>It is these monsoons that work out the problem we have in hand; and it is the <name>Great Deserts</name> alluded to that produce the monsoons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8811"/>On the succeeding page will be found a diagram, which will assist us in the conception of this beautiful operation of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8812"/>It consists of an outline sketch of so much of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName> and the <placeName reg="Indian Ocean" key="tgn,7016682">Indian Ocean</placeName> as are material to our purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8813"/>The <rs>Great Deserts</rs>, the <name>Himalayas</name> and the <name>Ghauts</name>, are marked on the sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8814"/>Let the dotted line at the bottom of the sketch represent the equator, and the arrows the direction of the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8815"/>Hindostan being in the northern tropic, the north-east monsoon or trade-wind, represented by the arrow A, would prevail there all the year round, but for the local causes of which I am about to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8816"/>The reader will observe that this wind, coming from a high northern latitude, passes almost entirely over <hi rend="italics">land</hi> before it reaches Hindostan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8817"/>It is, therefore, a dry wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8818"/>It is rendered even more dry, by its passage over the <name>Himalaya</name> range of mountains which wring from it what little moisture <pb id="p.726" n="726"/> <figure id="fig.726"> 
<head></head></figure> <pb id="p.727" n="727"/> it may have evaporated from the lakes and rivers over which it has passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8819"/>When it reaches the extensive plains between the <name>Himalayas</name> and Ghauts, which are the great cotton region of Hindostan, it has not a drop of water with which to nourish vegetation; and if it were to prevail all the year round, those plains would speedily become parched and waste deserts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8820"/>Let us see, now, how this catastrophe is avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8821"/>When the sun is in the southern hemisphere, that is, during the winter season, the north-east monsoon prevails in Hindostan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8822"/>When he is in the northern hemisphere, the south-west monsoon, which is the rainy monsoon, or crop monsoon, prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8823"/>This change of monsoons is produced as follows: Soon after the sun crosses the equator into the northern hemisphere, he begins to pour down his fierce rays upon Hindostan, and, passing farther and farther to the north, in the latter part of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, or the beginning of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, he is nearly perpendicularly over the <name>Great Deserts</name> marked in the sketch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8824"/>These deserts are interminable wastes of sand, in which there is not so much as a blade of grass to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8825"/>They absorb heat very rapidly, and in a short time become like so many fiery furnaces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8826"/>The air above them rarefies and ascends, a comparative vacuum of great extent is formed, and a great change begins now to take place in the atmospheric phenomena.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8827"/>This vacuum being in the rear of the arrow A, or the north-east monsoon blowing over Hindostan, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> slackens the force of this wind&mdash;drawing it back, as it were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8828"/>It becomes weaker and weaker, as the furnaces become hotter and hotter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8829"/>Calms ensue, and after a long struggle, the wind is finally turned back, and the south-west monsoon has set in.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8830"/>If the reader will cast his eye on the series of arrows, B, C, D, E, and F, he will see how this gradual change is effected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8831"/>I say gradual, for it is not effected <hi rend="italics">per saltum</hi>, but occupies several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8832"/>The arrow F represents the south-east trade-wind, blowing toward the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8833"/>As this wind nears the equator, it begins to feel the influence of the deserts spoken of. The calm which I have described as beginning at the arrow A, is gradually extended to the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8834"/>As the south-east wind approaches that great circle, it finds nothing to oppose its passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8835"/>Pretty soon, it not only finds nothing to oppose its passage, but something to invite it over; for the calm begins <pb id="p.728" n="728"/> now to give place to an indraught toward the <name>Great Deserts</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8836"/>The south-east wind, thus encouraged, changes its course, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the north, and then to the north-east, and blows stronger and stronger as the season advances, and the heat accumulates over the deserts; until at last the south-east trade-wind of the southern hemisphere has become the south-west monsoon of the northern hemisphere!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8837"/>This monsoon prevails from about the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> to the <dateStruct value="-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, when the sun has again passed into the southern hemisphere, and withdrawn his heat from the great deserts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8838"/>The normal condition of things being thus restored, the vanquished north-east trade-wind regains its courage, and, chasing back the south-west monsoon, resumes its sway.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8839"/>If the reader will again cast his eye upon the sketch, he will see that the south-west winds which are now blowing over Hindostan, instead of being dry winds, must be heavily laden with moisture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8840"/>They have had a clean sweep from the tropic of Capricorn, with no land intervening between them and the coast of Hindostan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8841"/>They have followed the sun in his course, and under the influence of his perpendicular rays have lapped up the waters like a thirsty wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8959"/>The cause of these terrible, short, racking seas, is the meeting of the winds and currents.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8987"/>These were the facts up to the time of <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s issuing to you the order in the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8988"/>Let us consider them for a moment, and see if they afford his lordship any ground for the extraordinary conclusion at which he has arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8989"/>My right to capture, and the legality of the capture, will not be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8990"/>Nor will you deny, in your experience as a naval officer, my right to commission this, or any other ship lawfully in my possession, as a tender to my principal ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8991"/>British Admirals do this every day, on distant stations; and the tender, from the time of her being put in commission, wears a pennant, and is entitled to all the immunities and privileges of a ship of war, the right of capturing enemy's ships included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8992"/>Numerous decisions are to be found in your own prize law to this effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8993"/>In other words, this is <num value="1">one</num> of the recognized modes of commissioning a ship of war, which has grown out of the convenience of the thing, and become a sort of naval common law of the sea, as indisputable as the written law itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8994"/>The only difference between the commission of such a ship, and that of a ship commissioned by the <pb id="p.740" n="740"/> sovereign authority at home is, that the word <q direct="unspecified">tender</q> appears in the former commission, and not in the latter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8995"/>The <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName></hi> having, then, been commissioned by me, in accordance with the recognized practice of all civilized nations that have a marine, can any other government than my own look into her antecedents?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8996"/>Clearly not. The only thing which can be looked at, upon her entering a foreign port, is her commission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8997"/>If this be issued by competent authority, you cannot proceed a step further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8998"/>The ship then becomes a part of the territory of the country to which she belongs, and you can exercise no more jurisdiction over her, than over that territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8999"/>The self-respect, and the independence of nations require this; for it would be a monstrous doctrine, to admit, that <num value="1">one</num> nation may inquire into the title by which another nation holds her ships of war. And there can be no difference, in this respect, between tenders, and ships originally commissioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9000"/>The flag and the pennant fly over them both, and they are both withdrawn from the local jurisdiction by competent commissions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9001"/>On principle you might as well have undertaken to inquire into the antecedents of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> as of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName></hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9002"/>A simple illustration will suffice to show you how untenable your position is in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9003"/>If the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName>'s</hi> commission be admitted to have been issued by competent authority, and in due form&mdash; and I do not understand this to be denied&mdash;she is as much a ship of war as the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Narcissus,,,,," id="n0133.0052.00740.01842" reg="mostcommon:Narcissus,nomatch:0"><surname>Narcissus</surname></persName></hi>, your flag-ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9004"/>Suppose you should visit a French port, under circumstances similar to those under which the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName></hi> visited <placeName reg="Simon's Town">Simon's Town</placeName>, and the <rs>French Government</rs> should threaten you with seizure, unless you satisfied it as to the antecedents of your ship, what would you think of the pretension?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9005"/>Suppose your late war with <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> was still progressing&mdash;France being neutral&mdash;and your ship had been captured from the <name>Russians</name>, and commissioned by your Government, without having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been condemned by a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize court</orgName>, would this make any difference?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9006"/>You see that it would not. The pretension would be an insult to your Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9007"/>And in what does the supposed proceeding differ from the <num value="1">one</num> in hand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9008"/>In both it is a pretension on the part of a foreign power, to look into the antecedents of a ship of war&mdash; neither more nor less in the <num value="1">one</num> case than in the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9009"/>I will even put the case stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9010"/>If I had seized a ship belonging to a power with which my Government was at peace, and commissioned <pb id="p.741" n="741"/> her, you could not undertake to inquire into the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9011"/>You would have no right to know, but that I had the orders of my Government for the seizure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9012"/>In short, you would have no right to inquire into the matter at all. My ship being regularly commissioned, I am responsible to my Government for my acts, and that Government, in the case supposed, would be responsible to the friendly power whose ship had been seized, and not to you. Nay, the case may be put stronger still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9013"/>The Federal States have captured a number of <name>British</name> vessels, in the act of attempting to run the blockade of the ports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9014"/>Suppose the <rs>Federal States</rs> had commissioned <num value="1">one</num> of these ships, without her having been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> condemned by a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize-court</orgName>, and she had afterward come into <name>British</name> waters, could you have seized her, even though you might know her capture to have been wrongful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9015"/>Certainly not. It would be a matter which you could inquire into in another form, but not in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9016"/>The ship would have become a ship of war, exempt from your jurisdiction, and you could not touch her. If this reasoning be correct&mdash;and with all due submission to his lordship, I think it is sustained by the plainest principles of the <rs>International Code</rs>&mdash;it follows that the condemnation of a prize in a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize-court</orgName>, is not the only mode of changing the character of a captured ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9017"/>When the sovereign of the captor puts his commission on board such a ship, this is a condemnation in its most solemn form; and is notice to all the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9018"/>Further, as to this question of adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9019"/>Your letter to <persName n="Low,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0133.0052.00741.01843" reg="mostcommon:Low,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Low</surname></persName>, the late <rs type="role" reg="Commander">commander</rs> of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName></hi>, assumes that as that ship was not condemned, she was the property of the enemy from whom she had been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9020"/>On what ground can you undertake to make this decision?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9021"/>Condemnation is intended for the benefit of neutrals, and to quiet the titles of purchasers, but is never necessary as against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9022"/>He has, and can have no rights in a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">prize-court</orgName> at all. He cannot appear there, either in person or by attorney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9023"/>He is divested of his property by <hi rend="italics">force</hi>, and not by any legal process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9024"/>The <hi rend="italics">possession</hi> of his property by his enemy, is all that is required as against him. What right, then, has the <rs>British Government</rs> to step in between me and my right of possession&mdash;waiving, for the present, the question of the commission, and supposing the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2005546" n="1.000 50" reg="tuscaloosa, tuscaloosa, alabama">Tuscaloosa</placeName></hi> to be nothing more than a prize-ship?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9025"/>Does the fact of my prize being in <name>British</name> waters, in violation of the <rs>Queen</rs>'s proclamation, give it this right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9026"/>Clearly not; for we are speaking now of rights under the laws of nations, and a mere municipal order cannot abrogate these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9226"/>Sir:&mdash;I have the honor to inform you, that, in accordance with my intention as previously announced to you, I steamed out of the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName> between <time value="9">nine</time> and <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-06-19"><day reg="19">19th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, for the purpose of engaging the enemy's <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Kearsarge</rs>, which had been lying off, and on the port, for several days previously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9227"/>After clearing the harbor, we descried the enemy, with his head off shore, at the distance of about <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>. We were <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour in coming up with him. I had previously pivotted my guns to starboard, and made all preparations for engaging the enemy on that side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9228"/>When within about a mile and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of the enemy, he suddenly wheeled, and, bringing his head in shore, presented his starboard battery to me. By this time, we were distant about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> from each other, when I opened on him with solid shot, to which he replied in a few minutes, and the action became active on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9229"/>The enemy now pressed his ship under a full head of steam, and to prevent our passing each other too speedily, and to keep our respective broadsides bearing, it became necessary to fight in a circle; the <num value="2">two</num> ships steaming around a common centre, and preserving a distance from each other of from <num value="3">three</num> quarters to half a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9230"/>When we got within good shell range, we opened upon him with shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9231"/>Some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> after the commencement of the action, our spanker-gaff was shot away, and our ensign came down by the run. This was immediately replaced by another at the mizzen-masthead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9232"/>The firing now became very hot, and the enemy's shot, and shell soon began to tell upon our hull, knocking down, killing, and disabling a number of men, at the same time, in different parts of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9233"/>Perceiving that our shell, though apparently exploding against the enemy's sides, were doing him but little damage, I returned to solid-shot firing, and from this time onward alternated with shot, and shell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9234"/>After the lapse of about <num value="1">one</num> hour and <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, our ship was ascertained to be in a sinking condition, the enemy's shell having exploded in our side, and between decks, opening large apertures through which the water rushed with great rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9235"/>For some few minutes I had hopes of being able to reach the <rs>French</rs> coast, for which purpose I gave the ship all steam, and set such of the fore-and-aft sails as were available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9236"/>The ship filled so rapidly, however, that before we had made much progress, the fires were extinguished in the furnaces, and we were evidently on the point of sinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9237"/>I now hauled down my colors, to prevent the further destruction of life, and dispatched a boat to inform the enemy of our condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9238"/>Although we were now but <measure n="400yards" type="distance">400 yards</measure> from each other, the enemy fired upon me <num value="5">five</num> times after my colors had been struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9239"/>It is charitable to suppose that a ship of war of a Christian <pb id="p.758" n="758"/> nation could not have done this, intentionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9240"/>We now directed all our exertions toward saving the wounded, and such of the boys of the ship as were unable to swim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9241"/>These were dispatched in my quarter-boats, the only boats remaining to me; the waist-boats having been torn to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9242"/>Some <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> after my furnace-fires had been extinguished, and when the ship was on the point of settling, every man, in obedience to a previous order which had been given the crew, jumped overboard, and endeavored to save himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9243"/>There was no appearance of any boat coming to me from the enemy, until after my ship went down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9248"/>At the end of the engagement, it was discovered by those of our officers who went alongside of the enemy's ship, with the wounded, that her mid-ship section, on both sides, was thoroughly iron-coated; this having been done with chains, constructed for the purpose, placed perpendicularly, from the rail to the water's edge, the whole covered over by a thin outer planking, which gave no indication of the armor beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9249"/>This planking had been ripped off, in every direction, by our shot and shell, the chain broken, and indented in many places, and forced partly into the ship's side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9250"/>She was effectually guarded, however, in this section, from penetration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9251"/>The enemy was much damaged, in other parts, but to what extent it is now impossible to say. It is believed he is badly crippled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9252"/>My officers and men behaved steadily and gallantly, and though they have lost their ship, they have not lost honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9253"/>Where all behaved so well, it would be invidious to particularize, but I cannot deny myself the pleasure of saying that <persName n="Kell,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0053.00758.01881" reg="mostcommon:Kell,John,M.,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kell</surname></persName>, my first lieutenant, deserves great credit for the fine condition in which the ship went into action, with regard to her battery, magazine and shell-rooms, and that he rendered me great assistance, by his coolness, and judgment, as the fight proceeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9254"/>The enemy was heavier than myself, both in ship, battery, and crew; but I did not know until the action was over, that she was also iron-clad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9255"/>Our total loss in killed and wounded, is <num value="30">30</num>, to wit: <measure n="9" type="killed">9 killed</measure>, and <measure n="21" type="wounded">21 wounded</measure>. </p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9537"/>Sir:&mdash;As <num value="2">two</num> correspondents of your journal, in giving their versions of the fight between the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Kearsarge</hi>, have designated my share in the escape of <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00781.02012" reg="nearbymention:Semmes,O.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName>, and a portion of the crew of the sunken ship as <quote>dishonorable,</quote> and have moreover affirmed that my yacht, the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi>, was in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName> before the engagement, and proceeded thence, on the morning of the engagement in order to assist the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, I presume I may trespass upon your kindness so far as to ask an opportunity to repudiate the imputation, and deny the assertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9538"/>They admit that when the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> went down, the yacht, being near the <hi rend="italics">Kearsarge</hi>, was hailed by <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00781.02013" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName>, and requested to aid in picking up the men who were in the water; but they intimate that my services were expected to be merely ministerial; or, in other words, that I was to put myself under the command of <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00781.02014" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName>, and place my yacht at his disposal for the capture of the poor fellows who were struggling in the water for their lives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9539"/>The fact is, that when we passed the <hi rend="italics">Kearsarge</hi>, the captain cried out, <quote>For <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake, do what you can to save them,</quote> and that was my warrant for interfering, in any way, for the aid and succor of his enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9540"/>It may be a question with some, whether, without that warrant, I should have been justified in endeavoring to rescue any of the crew of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>;</hi> but my own opinion is, that a man drowning in the open sea cannot be regarded as an enemy, at the time, to anybody, and is, therefore, entitled to the assistance of any passer-by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9541"/>Be this as it may, I had the earnest request of <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00781.02015" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName>, to rescue as many of the men who were in the water, as I could lay hold of, but that request was not coupled with any stipulation to the effect that I should deliver up the rescued men to him, as his prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9542"/>If it had been, I should have declined the task, because I should have deemed it dishonorable&mdash;that is, inconsistent with my notions of honor&mdash;to lend my yacht and crew, for the purpose of rescuing those brave men from drowning, only to hand them over to their enemies, for imprisonment, ill-treatment, and perhaps execution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9543"/><num value="1">One</num> of your correspondents opens his letter, by expressing a desire, to bring to the notice of the yacht clubs of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the conduct of the commander of the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi>, which followed the engagement of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> and <hi rend="italics">Kearsarge</hi>. Now that my conduct has been impugned, I am equally wishful that it should come under the notice of the yacht clubs of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and I am quite willing to leave the point of honor to be decided by my brother yachtsmen, and, indeed, by any tribunal of gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9544"/>As to my legal right to take away <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00781.02016" reg="nearbymention:Semmes,O.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and his friends, I have been educated in the belief that an English ship is <name>English</name> territory, and I am, therefore, unable, even now, to discover why I was more bound to surrender the people of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> whom I had <pb id="p.782" n="782"/> on board my yacht, than the owner of a garden on the south coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would have been, if they had swum to such a place, and landed there, or than the <rs>Mayor</rs> of <placeName reg="Southampton, Hampshire, England" key="tgn,7011385">Southampton</placeName> was, when they were lodged in that city; or than the <rs>British Government</rs> is, now that it is known that they are somewhere in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9545"/>Your other correspondent says that <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00782.02017" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName> declares that <quote>the reason he did not pursue the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi>, or fire into her was, that he could not believe, at the time, that any <num value="1">one</num> carrying the flag of the <orgName n="Royal Yacht Squadron" type="squadron">royal yacht squadron</orgName>, could act so dishonorable a part, as to carry off the prisoners whom he had requested him to save, from feelings of humanity.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9546"/>I was not aware then, and I am not aware now, that the men whom I saved <hi rend="italics">were, or ever had been his prisoners</hi>. Whether any of the circumstances which had preceded the sinking of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> constituted them prisoners was a question that never came under my consideration, and <num value="1">one</num> which I am not disposed to discuss even now. I can only say, that it is a new doctrine to me, that <hi rend="italics">when <num value="1">one</num> ship sinks another, in warfare, the crew of the sunken ship are debarred from swimming for their lives, and seeking refuge wherever they can find it;</hi> and it is a doctrine which I shall not accept, unless backed by better authority than that of the master of the <hi rend="italics">Kearsarge</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9547"/>Another reason assigned by your correspondent for that hero's forbearance may be imagined in the reflection that such a performance as that of <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00782.02021" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, who dragged <num value="2">two</num> <quote>enemies</quote> or <quote>rebels</quote> from an English ship, would not bear repetition.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9550"/>Your anonymous correspondent further says, that <quote><persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00782.02025" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName> would now have all the officers and men of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, as prisoners, had he not placed too much confidence in the honor of an Englishman, who carried the flag of the <orgName n="Royal Yacht Squadron" type="squadron">royal yacht squadron</orgName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9551"/>This is a very questionable assertion; for why did <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00782.02026" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName> confide in that Englishman?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9552"/>Why did he implore his interference, calling out, <quote>For <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake, do what you can to save them?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9553"/>I presume it was because he would not, or could not save them, himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9554"/>The fact is, that if the <rs>Captain</rs> and crew of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> had depended for safety altogether upon <persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00782.02027" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName>, <hi rend="italics">not <num value="0.5">one half</num> of them would have been saved</hi>. He got quite as many of them as he could lay hold of, time enough to deliver them from drowning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9555"/>I come now to the more definite charges advanced by your correspondents, and these I will soon dispose of. They maintain that <pb id="p.783" n="783"/> my yacht was in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName>, for the purpose of assisting the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and that her movements before the action prove that she attended her for the same object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9556"/>My impression is, that the yacht was in <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName>, to suit my convenience, and pleasure, and I am quite sure, that when there, I neither did, nor intended to do anything to serve the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>. We steamed out on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> to see the engagement, and the resolution to do so was the result of a family council, whereat the question <quote>to go out,</quote> or <quote>not to go out,</quote> was duly discussed, and the decision in the affirmative was carried by the juveniles, rather against the wish of both myself, and my wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9557"/>Had I contemplated taking any part in the movements of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, I do not think I should have been accompanied with my wife, and several young children.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9558"/><num value="1">One</num> of your correspondents, however, says that he knows that the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi> did assist the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and if he does know this, he knows more than I do. As to the movements of the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi>, before the action, all the movements with which I was acquainted, were for the objects of enjoying the summer morning, and getting a good and safe place from which to watch the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9559"/>Another of your correspondents declares, that since the affair, it has been discovered, that the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi> was a consort of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, and on the night before had received many valuable articles, for safe-keeping, from that vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9560"/>This is simply untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9561"/>Before the engagement, neither I nor any member of my family had any knowledge of, or communication with <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n0133.0055.00783.02028" reg="nearbymention:Semmes,O.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName>, or any of his officers or any of his crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9562"/>Since the fight I have inquired from my <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> whether he, or any of my crew, had had any communication with the <rs>Captain</rs> or crew of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi>, prior to meeting them on the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi> after the engagement, and his answer, given in the most emphatic manner, has been, <quote>None whatever.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9563"/>As to the deposit of chronometers, and other valuable articles, the whole story is a myth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9564"/>Nothing was brought from the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> to the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi>, and I never heard of the tale, until I saw it, in an extract from your own columns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9565"/>After the fight was over, the drowning men picked up, and the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi> steaming away to <placeName reg="Southampton, Hampshire, England" key="tgn,7011385">Southampton</placeName>, some of the officers who had been saved began to express their acknowledgments for my services, and my reply to them, which was addressed, also, to all who stood around, was <quote>Gentlemen, you have no need to give me any special thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9566"/>I should have done exactly the same for the other people, if they had needed it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9567"/>This speech would have been a needless, and, indeed, an absurd piece of hypocrisy, if there had been any league or alliance between the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName></hi> and the <hi rend="italics"><rs type="ship2">Deerhound</rs></hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9568"/>This is a point which I have nothing to do with, and therefore I shall not discuss it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9722"/>The enemy being in full possession of this river by means of his gunboats, it was a matter of some little management to cross in safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9723"/>The transMississippi mails to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> had been sent over, however, quite regularly, under the personal superintendence of a young officer, detailed for the purpose, and the <rs>General</rs> was kind enough to arrange for my crossing with this gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9724"/>The news of my passing through <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> had reached the enemy at New Orleans, as we learned by his newspapers, and great vigilance had been enjoined on his gunboats to intercept me, if <pb id="p.797" n="797"/> possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9725"/>Our arrangements being completed, I left <placeName reg="Alexandria, Rapides, Louisiana" key="tgn,7013268">Alexandria</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-12-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, accompanied by my son, who had obtained a short leave of absence for the purpose of visiting his home, and reached the little village of <placeName reg="Evergreen, Conecuh, Alabama" key="tgn,2003439">Evergreen</placeName> the next day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9726"/>The journey through the swamps, leading to these rivers, was unique.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9727"/>We performed it on horseback, pursuing mere bridle-paths and cattle-tracks, in single file, like so many <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0133.0056.00797.02093" reg="mostcommon:Indians,nomatch:0"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9728"/>Our way sometimes led us through a forest of gigantic trees, almost entirely devoid of under-growth, and resembling very much, though after a wild fashion, the park scenery of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9729"/>At other times we would plunge into a dense, tangled brake, where the interlaced grape and other vines threatened every moment, to drag us from our saddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9730"/>The whole was a drowned country, and impassable during the season of rains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9731"/>It was now low water, and as we rode along, the high-water marks on the trees were visible, many feet above our heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9732"/>From this description of the country, the reader will see how impossible it was for artillery or cavalry, or even infantry, to operate on the banks of these rivers, during a greater part of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9733"/>Except at a few points, the enemy's gunboats were almost as secure from attack as they would have been, on the high seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9734"/>Occasionally, we had to swim a deep bayou, whose waters looked as black as those of the <rs type="place">Stygian Lake</rs>; but if the bayou was wide, as well as deep, we more frequently dismounted, stripped our horses, and surrounding them, and shouting at them, made them take the water in a drove, and swim over by themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9735"/>We then crossed in skiffs, which the mail-men had provided for the purpose, and caught and resaddled our horses for a fresh mount.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9736"/>We reached the bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 4" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> just before dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9737"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> of the enemy's gunboats anchored in the river, at a distance of about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9738"/>As remarked in another place, the enemy had converted every sort of a water craft, into a ship of war, and now had them in such number, that he was enabled to police the river in its entire <pb id="p.798" n="798"/> length, without the necessity of his boats being out of sight of each other's smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9739"/>The officers of these river craft were mostly volunteers from the merchant service, whose commissions would expire with the war, and a greater set of predatory rascals was, perhaps, never before collected in the history of any government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9740"/>They robbed the plantations, and demoralized them by trade, at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9741"/>Our people were hard pressed for the necessaries of life, and a constant traffic was being carried on with them, by these armed river steamers, miscalled ships of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9742"/>It would not do, of course, for us to attempt the passage of the river, until after dark; and so we held ourselves under cover of the forest, until the proper moment, and then embarked in a small skiff, sending back the greater part of our escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9743"/>Our boat was scarcely able to float the numbers that were packed into her. Her gunwales were no more than <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> above the water's edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9744"/>Fortunately for us, however, the night was still, and the river smooth, and we pulled over without accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9745"/>As we shot within the shadows of the opposite bank, our conductor, before landing, gave a shrill whistle to ascertain whether all was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9746"/>The proper response came directly, from those who were to meet us, and in a moment more, we leaped on shore among friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9769"/>Many of these miscreants were foreigners, incapable of speaking the <rs>English</rs> language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9770"/>The few dwellings that were left standing, looked like so many houses of mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9778"/>The civilians had betaken themselves to speculation and money-getting, and the soldiers to drinking and debauchery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9779"/>Such, in brief, was the picture which presented itself to my eyes as I passed through the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9794"/>I had come to him, I told him, to speak of what I had seen of the people, and of the army, in my transit across the country, and to say to him, that unless prompt measures could be devised to put an end to the desertions that were going on among our troops, our cause must inevitably be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9795"/>He did not seem to be at all surprised at the revelations I made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9796"/>He knew all about the condition of the country, civil and military, but seemed to feel himself powerless to prevent the downward tendency of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9797"/>And he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9798"/>It was no longer in the power of any <num value="1">one</num> man to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9799"/>The body-politic was already dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9800"/>The people themselves had given up the contest, and this being the case, no army could do more than retard the catastrophe for a few months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9827"/>The movements of the ships being confined to the head-waters of a narrow river, they were but little better than prison-ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9835"/>Desertion was the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9837"/>The strain upon them had been too great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9838"/>It was scarcely to be expected of men, of the class of those who usually form the rank and file of ships' companies, that they would rise above their natures, and sacrifice themselves by slow but sure degrees, in any cause, however holy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9840"/>The general understanding, that the collapse of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was at hand, had its influence with some of the more honorable of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9842"/>To add to the disorder, the <q direct="unspecified">Union element,</q> as it was called, began to grow bolder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9846"/>Many of these men were preachers of the various denominations, and schoolmasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9847"/>These white-cravatted gentlemen now sprang into unusual activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9848"/>Every mail brought long and artfully written letters from some of these scoundrels, tempting my men to desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9850"/>If I had had my fleet upon the sea, it would have been an easy matter to restore its discipline, but my ships were, in fact, only so many tents, into which entered freely all the bad influences of which I speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9918"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was to be evacuated during the night, during which I was to burn my ships, accoutre and provision my men, and join <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0133.0058.00810.02165" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sydney,Smith,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9919"/>But I had become used to emergencies, and was not dismayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9920"/><num value="1">1</num> signalled all my captains to come on board, and communicated to them the intelligence I had received, and concerted with them the programme of the night's work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9921"/>It was not possible to attempt anything before dark, without exciting the suspicions of the enemy, as we were no more than <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> from his lines; and I enjoined upon my commanders the necessity of keeping their secret, until the proper moment for action should arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9922"/>The sun was shining brightly, the afternoon was calm, and nature was just beginning to put on her spring attire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9923"/>The fields were green with early grass, the birds were beginning to twitter, and the ploughman had already broken up his fields for planting his corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9924"/>I looked abroad upon the landscape, and contrasted the peace and quiet of nature, so heedless of man's woes, with the disruption of a great Government, and the ruin of an entire people which were at hand!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9925"/>So unsuspicious were the <rs>Government</rs> subordinates, of what was going on, that the flag-of-truce boats were still plying between <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the enemy's Headquarters, a few miles below us, on the river, carrying backward and forward exchanged prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9926"/>As those boats would pass us, coming up the river, filled to overflowing with our poor fellows just released from <name>Yankee</name> prisons, looking wan and hollow-eyed, the prisoners would break into the most enthusiastic cheering as they passed my flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9927"/>It seemed to welcome them home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9928"/>They little dreamed, that it would be struck that night, forever, and the fleet blown into the air; that their own fetters had been knocked off in vain, and that they were to pass, henceforth, under the rule of the hated <rs>Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9929"/>I was sick at heart as I listened to those cheers, and reflected upon the morrow.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9930"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0133.0058.00810.02166" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sydney,Smith,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had failed to give me any notice of his disaster, or of what his intentions were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9931"/>As mine was an entirely independent <pb id="p.811" n="811"/> command, he, perhaps, rightly considered, that it was the duty of the <rs>Executive Government</rs> to do this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9932"/>Still, in accordance with the expressed wishes of <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0058.00811.02167" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, I endeavored to communicate with him; sending an officer on shore to the signal station, at <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>, for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9933"/>No response came, however, to our telegrams, and night having set in, I paid no further attention to the movements of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9934"/>I plainly saw that it was a case of <hi rend="italics">save qui peut</hi>, and that I must take care of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9935"/>I was to make another <hi rend="italics"><persName><foreName>Ala</foreName></persName> bama</hi>-plunge into the sea, and try my luck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9936"/>Accordingly, when night drew her friendly curtain between the enemy and myself, I got all my ships under way, and ran up to <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9937"/>It was here I designed to blow up the iron-clads, throw their crews on board the wooden gunboats, and proceed in the latter to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>, opposite <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, on my way to join <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0133.0058.00811.02168" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sydney,Smith,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9938"/>Deeming secrecy of great importance to the army, in its attempted escape from its lines, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intention was to <hi rend="italics">sink</hi> my fleet quietly, instead of blowing it up, as the explosions would give the enemy notice of what was going on. The reader may judge of my surprise, when, in the course of an hour or <num value="2">two</num> after dark, I saw the whole horizon, on the north side of the <rs>James</rs>, glowing with fires of burning quarters, <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi>, &amp;c., lighted by our own troops, as they successively left their intrenchments!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9939"/>Concealment on my part was no longer necessary or indeed practicable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9940"/>I now changed my determination and decided upon burning my fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9941"/>My officers and men worked like beavers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9942"/>There were a <num value="1000">thousand</num> things to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9943"/>The sailor was leaving the homestead which he had inhabited for several months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9944"/>Arms had to be served out, provisions gotten up out of the hold, and broken into such packages, as the sailors could carry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9945"/>Hammocks had to be unlashed, and the blankets taken out, and rolled up as compactly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9946"/>Haversacks and canteens had to be improvised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9947"/>These various operations occupied us until a late hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9948"/>It was between <time value="2">two</time> and <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the morning, before the crews of the iron-clads were all safely embarked on board the wooden gunboats, and the iron-clads were well on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9949"/>My little squadron of wooden boats now moved off up the river, by the glare of the burning <pb id="p.812" n="812"/> iron-clads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9950"/>They had not proceeded far, before an explosion, like the shock of an earthquake, took place, and the air was filled with missiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9951"/>It was the blowing up of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi>, my late flag-ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9952"/>The spectacle was grand beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9953"/>Her shell-rooms had been full of loaded shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9954"/>The explosion of the magazine threw all these shells, with their fuses lighted, into the air. The fuses were of different lengths, and as the shells exploded by twos and threes, and by the dozen, the pyrotechnic effect was very fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9955"/>The explosion shook the houses in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and must have waked the echoes of the night for <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> around.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9956"/>There are several bridges spanning the <rs>James</rs> between <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName> and the city, and at <num value="1">one</num> of these we were detained an hour, the draw being down to permit the passage of some of the troops from the north side of the river, who had lighted the bonfires of which I have spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9957"/>Owing to this delay, the sun&mdash;a glorious, unclouded sun, as if to mock our misfortunes&mdash;was now rising over <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9958"/>Some windows, which fronted to the east, were all aglow with his rays, mimicking the real fires that were already breaking out in various parts of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9959"/>In the lower part of the city, the <name>Schoolship</name> <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName></hi> was burning, and some of the houses near the <rs type="place">Navy Yard</rs> were on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9960"/>But higher up was the principal scene of the conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9961"/>Entire blocks were on fire here, and a dense canopy of smoke, rising high in the still morning air, was covering the city as with a pall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9962"/>The <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> of our army had just crossed, as I landed my fleet at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>, and the bridges were burning in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9963"/>The Trcdegar Iron Works were on fire, and continual explosions of loaded shell stored there were taking place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9964"/>In short, the scene cannot be described by mere words, but the reader may conceive a tolerable idea of it, if he will imagine himself to be looking on Pandemonium broken loose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9965"/>The population was in a great state of alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9966"/>Hundreds of men and women had sought refuge on the <rs>Manchester</rs> side, in the hope of getting away, by some means or other, they knew not how. I was, myself, about the most helpless man in the whole crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9967"/>I had just tumbled on shore, with their bags and baggage, <num value="500">500</num> sailors, incapable of marching a dozen miles without becoming foot-sore, and without any means, <pb id="p.813" n="813"/> whatever, of transportation being provided for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9968"/>I had not so much as a pack-mule to carry a load of provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9969"/>I was on foot, myself, in the midst of my men. A current of horsemen, belonging to our retreating column, was sweeping past me, but there was no horse for me to mount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9970"/>It was every man for himself, and d&mdash;l take the hindmost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9971"/>Some of the young cavalry rascals&mdash;lads of <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>&mdash; as they passed, jibed and joked with my old salts, asking them how they liked navigating the land, and whether they did not expect to anchor in <placeName key="tgn,2335574" n="1.000 8" reg="fort warren, suffolk, massachusetts">Fort Warren</placeName> pretty soon?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9972"/>The spectacle presented by my men was, indeed, rather a ludicrous <num value="1">one</num>; loaded down, as they were, with pots, and pans, and messkettles, bags of bread, and chunks of salted pork, sugar, tea, tobacco, and pipes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9973"/>It was as much as they could do to stagger under their loads&mdash;marching any distance seemed out of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9974"/>As I reviewed my <q direct="unspecified">troops,</q> after they had been drawn up by my captains, who were now all become colonels, I could not but repeat to myself <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0058.00813.02169" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>'s last words&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">You will join <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0133.0058.00813.02170" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sydney,Smith,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, in the field, with all your forces.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9975"/></p> 
<p>Yes; here were my <q direct="unspecified">forces,</q> but where, the d&mdash;l, was <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0133.0058.00813.02171" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sydney,Smith,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and how was I to join him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9976"/>If I had had the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, on foot, by the side of me, I rather think this latter question would have puzzled him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9977"/>But there was no time to be lost,&mdash;I must do something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9978"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing, of course, after landing my men, was to burn my wooden gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9979"/>This was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9980"/>They were fired, and shoved off from the landing, and permitted to float down the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9981"/>I then <q direct="unspecified">put my column in motion,</q> and we <q direct="unspecified">marched</q> a distance of several squares, blinded by the dust kicked up by those vagabonds on horseback, before mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9982"/>When we came in sight of the railroad depot, I halted, and inquired of some of the fugitives who were rushing by, about the trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9983"/><q direct="unspecified">The trains!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9984"/>said they, in astonishment at my question; <q direct="unspecified">the last train left at daylight this morning&mdash;it was filled with the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Officer">civil officers</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9985"/>Notwithstanding this answer, I moved my command up to the station and workshops, to satisfy myself by a personal inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9986"/>It was well that I did so, as it saved my command from the capture that impended over it. I found it quite true, that the <q direct="unspecified">last train</q> had departed; and, also, that all the railroadmen <pb id="p.814" n="814"/> had either run off in the train, or hidden themselves out of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9987"/>There was no <num value="1">one</num> in charge of anything, and no <num value="1">one</num> who knew anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9988"/>But there was some material lying around me; and, with this, I resolved to set up railroading on my own account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9989"/>Having a dozen and more steam-engineers along with me, from my late fleet, I was perfectly independent of the assistance of the alarmed railroad-men, who had taken to flight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9990"/>A pitiable scene presented itself, upon our arrival at the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9991"/>Great numbers had flocked thither, in the hope of escape; frightened men, despairing women, and crying children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9992"/>Military patients had hobbled thither from the hospitals; civil employees of the <rs>Government</rs>, who had missed the <q direct="unspecified">last train,</q> by being a little too late, had come to remedy their negligence; and a great number of other citizens, who were anxious to get out of the presence of the hated <rs>Yankee</rs>, had rushed to the station, they scarcely knew why. These people had crowded into, and on the top of, a few straggling passenger cars, that lay uncoupled along the track, in seeming expectation that some <num value="1">one</num> was to come, in due time, and take them off. There was a small engine lying also on the track, but there was no fire in its furnace, no fuel with which to make a fire, and no <num value="1">one</num> to manage it. Such was the condition of affairs when I <q direct="unspecified">deployed</q> my <q direct="unspecified">forces</q> upon the open square, and <q direct="unspecified">grounded arms,</q>&mdash;the butts of my rifles not ringing on the ground quite as harmoniously as I could have desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9993"/>Soldiering was new to <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0133.0058.00814.02172" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>; however, he would do better by-and-by.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9994"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> move was to turn all these wretched people I have described out of the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9995"/>Many plaintive appeals were made to me by the displaced individuals, but my reply to them all was, that it was better for an unarmed citizen to fall into the hands of the enemy, than a soldier with arms in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9996"/>The cars were then drawn together and coupled, and my own people placed in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9997"/>We next took the engine in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9998"/>A body of my marine <q direct="unspecified">sappers and miners</q> were set at work to pull down a picket fence, in front of <num value="1">one</num> of the dwellings, and chop it into firewood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9999"/>An engineer and firemen were detailed for the locomotive, and in a very few minutes, we had the steam hissing from its boiler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10000"/>I now permitted as many of the frightened <pb id="p.815" n="815"/> citizens as could find places to clamber upon the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10001"/>All being in readiness, with the triumphant air of a man who had overcome a great difficulty, and who felt as if he might snap his fingers at the <rs>Yankees</rs> once more, I gave the order to <q direct="unspecified">go ahead.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10002"/>But this was easier said than done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10003"/>The little locomotive started at a snail's pace, and drew us creepingly along, until we reached a slightly ascending grade, which occurs almost immediately after leaving the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10004"/>Here it came to a dead halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10005"/>The firemen stirred their fires, the engineer turned on all his steam, the engine panted and struggled and screamed, but all to no purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10006"/>We were effectually stalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10007"/>Our little iron horse was incompetent to do the work which had been required of it. Here was a predicament!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10008"/>We were still directly opposite the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and in full view of it, for the track of the road runs some distance up the river-bank, before it bends away westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10009"/>Amid flames and smoke and tumult and disorder, the enemy's hosts were pouring into the streets of the proud old capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10010"/>Long lines of cavalry and artillery and infantry could be seen, moving like a huge serpent through the streets, and winding their way to State-<address><street n="House Square">House Square</street></address>. As a crowning insult, a regiment of negro cavalry, wild with savage delight at the thought of triumphing over their late masters, formed a prominent feature in the grand procession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10011"/>Alongside of the black savage marched the white savage&mdash;worthy compeers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10012"/>nay, scarcely; the black savage, under the circumstances, was the more worthy of respect of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10013"/>The prophecy of <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName> was fulfilled; the very halls, in which he had thundered forth the prophecy, were in possession of the <q direct="unspecified">stranger,</q> against whom he had warned his countrymen!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10014"/>My temporary safety lay in <num value="2">two</num> circumstances: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the enemy was so drunk with his success, that he had no eyes for any <num value="1">one</num> but himself and the population of the proud city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> which he was seeking to abase; and secondly, the bridges leading across the river were all on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10015"/>Whilst I was pondering what was best to be done, whether I should uncouple a portion of the train, and permit the rest to escape, an engineer came running to me to say that he had discovered another engine, which the absconding railroad people had hidden away in the recesses of their work-shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10016"/>The new engine was rolled out immediately, <pb id="p.816" n="816"/> steam raised on it in a few minutes, and by the aid of the <num value="2">two</num> engines, we gave our train, with the indifferent fuel we had, a speed of <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> per hour, until we reached the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wood-pile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10017"/>Here getting hold of some better fuel, we fired up with better effect, and went thundering, with the usual speed, on our course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10018"/>It was thus, after I had, in fact, been abandoned by the <rs>Government</rs> and the army, that I saved my command from capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10019"/>I make no charges&mdash;utter no complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10020"/>Perhaps neither the <rs>Government</rs>, nor the army was to blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10021"/>The great disaster fell upon them both so suddenly, that, perhaps, neither could do any better; but the naked fact is, that the fleet was abandoned to shift for itself, there being, as before remarked, not only no transportation provided for carrying a pound of provisions, or a cooking-utensil, but not even a horse for its <rs type="role2">Admiral</rs> to mount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10022"/>As a matter of course, great disorder prevailed, in all the villages, and at all the way-stations, by which we passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10023"/>We had a continual accession of passengers, until not another man could be packed upon the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10024"/>So great was the demoralization, that we picked up <q direct="unspecified">unattached</q> generals and colonels on the road, in considerable numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10025"/>The most amusing part of our journey, however, was an attempt made by some of the railroad officials to take charge of our train, after we had gotten some distance from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10026"/>Conductors and engineers now came forward, and insisted upon regulating our affairs for us. We declined the good offices of these gentlemen, and navigated to suit ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10027"/>The president, or superintendent of the road, I forget which, even had the assurance to complain, afterward, to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0133.0058.00816.02173" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, of my usurping his authority!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10031"/>My railroad cruise ended the next day&mdash;<dateStruct value="-04-4"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>&mdash;about midnight, when we reached the city of <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, and blew off our steam, encamping in the cars for the remainder of the night.

<p>Here, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, was a solemn <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName>, entered into by <num value="2">two</num> generals, who had opposing armies in the field, in which convention the <num value="1">one</num> and the other general stipulated for certain terms,&mdash;<persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02271" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> agreeing to lay down his arms and disband his forces, and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02272" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> agreeing, <hi rend="italics">in consideration thereof</hi>, that the forces thus disbanded shall proceed to their homes, and there remain undisturbed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10152"/>I beg you to observe the use of the word <q direct="unspecified">undisturbed,</q> <num value="1">one</num> of the most comprehensive words in our language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10153"/>I pray you also to remark the formalities with which this convention was drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10154"/>We were treated as officers commanding armies, representing, of course, if not a <hi rend="italics">de jure</hi>, at least a <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10155"/>Our proper military titles were acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10156"/>I was myself styled and treated in the muster-rolls, and other papers drawn up by both parties, a brigadier-general and a rear-admiral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10157"/>The honors of war usual upon surrenders, upon terms, were accorded to us, in our being permitted to retain our side-arms, private horses, and baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10158"/>In short, the future historian, upon reading this convention, will be unable to distinguish it in any particular from other similar papers, agreed upon by armies of recognized governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10159"/>At the date of, and some weeks prior to the ratification of this convention, I commanded a brigade of artillery, forming a part of the <orgName>army of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02273" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10160"/>I was, of course, included in the terms of the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10161"/>I complied with those terms, under orders received from <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02274" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, by turning over my arms to the proper officer, and disbanding my forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10162"/>The convention was approved by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10163"/>Your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> may recollect that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> convention entered into between <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02275" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02276" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, which provided, among other things, for the return of the <rs>Southern States</rs> to their functions under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, was disapproved by the <rs>Government</rs>, on the ground that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00826.02277" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in undertaking to treat of political matters, had transcended his authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10164"/>The armistice which had been declared between the <num value="2">two</num> armies was dissolved, and hostilities were renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10165"/>A few days afterward, however, new negotiations were commenced, and the convention with which we have to do was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> convention entered into by those <pb id="p.827" n="827"/> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and which was a substantial readoption of the military portion of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10166"/>It was this latter convention which was formally approved, both by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00827.02278" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the Commander-inChief, under whose orders <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00827.02279" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> acted, and by the <rs>Executive</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10167"/>Confiding in the good faith of the <rs>Government</rs>, pledged in a solemn treaty as above stated, I returned to my home in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and remained there for the space of <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>, engaging in civil pursuits as a means of livelihood for my dependent family, and yielding a ready obedience to the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10168"/>I had, in fact, become an officer of the law, having established myself as an attorney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10169"/>It would have been easy for me, at any time within these <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>, to pass out of the country, if I had had any doubt about the binding obligation of the <name>Greensboroa</name> convention, or of the good faith of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10170"/>But I had no doubt on either point; nor have I any doubt yet, as I feel quite sure that when you shall have informed yourself of all the facts of the case, you will come to the conclusion that my arrest was entirely without warrant, and order my discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10171"/>While thus remaining quietly at my home, in the belief that I was <q direct="unspecified">not to be disturbed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities,</q> I was, on the <dateStruct value="1865-12-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="12">December</month>, <year>1865</year>,</dateStruct> in the night-time, arrested by a lieutenant and <num value="2">two</num> sergeants of the <orgName type="mil" key="MarineCorps">Marine Corps</orgName>, under an order signed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, and placed under guard; a file of soldiers in the meantime surrounding my house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10172"/>I was informed by the officer making the arrest that I was to proceed to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> in his custody, there to answer to a charge, a copy of which he handed me. This charge, and the protest which I filed the next day with the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> of the <name>Department</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, against my arrest, your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> has already seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10173"/>The question for you then to decide, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is the legality of this arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10174"/>Can I, in violation of the terms of the <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName> already referred to, and under which I laid down my arms, be held to answer for any act of war committed anterior to the date of that convention?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10175"/>I respectfully submit that I cannot be so held, either during the continuance of the war, (and the political power has not yet proclaimed the war ended,) or after the war shall have been brought to a close by proclamation, and the restoration of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>, without a flagrant violation of faith on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10176"/>If it be admitted that I might be tried for any act <hi rend="italics">dehors</hi> the war, and having no connection with it&mdash;as, for instance, for a forgery&mdash;it is quite clear that I cannot be arrested or arraigned for any act manifestly of war, and acknowledged as such, (as the act, for instance, for which I was arrested,) whether such act be in consonance with the laws of war or in violation thereof; and this for the simple reason that the <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName> was a <hi rend="italics">condonation</hi> and an <hi rend="italics">oblivion</hi> of all precedent acts of war, of what nature soever those acts might be. I am <q direct="unspecified">not to be disturbed,</q> says the <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10177"/>Disturbed for what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10178"/>Why, manifestly, for any act of war theretofore committed against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10179"/>This is the only commonsense <pb id="p.828" n="828"/> view of the case; and if the convention did not mean this, it could mean nothing; and I laid down my arms, not upon terms, as I had supposed, but without terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10180"/>If I was still at the mercy of the conqueror, and my arrest asserts as much, I was in the condi tion of <num value="1">one</num> who had surrendered <hi rend="italics">unconditionally;</hi> but it has been seen that I did not surrender unconditionally, but upon terms&mdash; terms engrafted upon a treaty ratified and approved by the conqueror's Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10181"/>Nor is it consistent with good faith to qualify or restrain those terms, so as to make them inapplicable to acts of war that may be claimed to have been in violation of the laws of war; for this would be to refine away all the protection which has been thrown around me by treaty, and put me in the power of the opposite contracting party, who might put his own construction upon the laws of war. This very attempt, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, has been made in the case before you. I claim to have escaped, after my ship had sunk from under me in the engagement off <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName>, and I had been precipitated into the water, the enemy not having taken possession of me, according to the laws and usages of war, as your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> may read in almost every page of naval history; the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs> claiming the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10182"/>The true, and the only just and fair criterion, is, was the act for which the arrest was made an act of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10183"/>If so, there is an end of the question, and I must be discharged, for, as before remarked, the convention, if it is anything, is an oblivion of all acts of war of whatever nature.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10184"/>But it may be said that, although I cannot be tried by a military tribunal during the war, I may yet be tried by a civil tribunal after the war. Let us look at this question also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10185"/>I was, undoubtedly, amenable to the civil tribunals of the country, as well after as before the convention, for any offence of a purely civil nature, not founded upon an act of war&mdash;to instance, as before, the crime of forgery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10186"/>If I had committed a forgery in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, I could not, upon arraignment, plead the <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName> in bar of trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10187"/>Why not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10188"/>Because that convention had reference only to acts of war. I was treated with, in my capacity of a soldier and a seaman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10189"/>But, does it follow that I may be tried for treason?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10190"/>And if not, why not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10191"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> tells you that treason is a civil offence, and in his opinion triable exclusively by the civil courts, and he hopes you will give him plenty of occupation in trying <q direct="unspecified">many whom the sword has spared.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10192"/>(See his letter to you of the <dateStruct value="1866-01-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>.) But does not that officer forget that treason is made up of acts of war; and is it not apparent that you cannot try me for an act of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10193"/>The <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, which the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> says he loves even better than blood, declares, in words, that treason against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort&mdash;all of which adherence, giving of aid and comfort, &amp;c., are equally acts of war. There is no constructive treason in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10194"/>Thus I can neither be tried by a military tribunal during the war, nor a civil tribunal after the war, <pb id="p.829" n="829"/> for any act of war, or for treason which consists only of acts of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10195"/>But it may further be said that this convention, of which I am claiming the protection, is not a <hi rend="italics">continuing</hi> convention, and will expire with the war, when, as <persName n="Speed,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0059.00829.02280" reg="mostcommon:Speed,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Speed</surname></persName> thinks, you may hand me over to the civil tribunals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10196"/>Whence can such a conclusion be drawn?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10197"/>Not from the terms of the convention, for these contradict the conclusion; not by implication merely, but in <hi rend="italics">totidem verbis</hi>. The terms are, <q direct="unspecified">not to be disturbed, so <hi rend="italics">long as they shall observe their obligation and the laws in force where they may reside</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10198"/>A misuse of terms, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, sometimes misleads very clever minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10199"/>And I presume it is by a misuse of terms that the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> has fallen into this error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10200"/>(See his letter to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, before referred to.) That officer, while he admits that parole protects the party paroled from trial during the war, yet contends that it does not protect him from trial by a civil tribunal, for treason, after the war. As I have shown that treason can only consist of acts of war, and that the <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName> is an oblivion of all acts of war, the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs>, when he says that a paroled party may be tried for treason at the end of the war, (the parole being no longer a protection to him,) must mean that the parole will have died with the war. This is entirely true of a <hi rend="italics">mere parole</hi>, for a parole is only a promise, on the part of a prisoner of war, that if released from imprisonment, he will not take up arms again unless he is exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10201"/>This parole is as frequently given by prisoners of war, who have surrendered unconditionally, as by those who have surrendered upon terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10202"/>There cannot be any parole, then, without a prisoner of war, and the status of prisoner of war ceasing, the parole ceases&mdash;<hi rend="italics">cessante ratione cessat et ipsa lex</hi>. Thus far the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> is quite logical, but by confounding in his mind the certificates given to the officers and men of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00829.02281" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, stating the terms of the <name>Greensboroa</name> convention, and guaranteeing those officers and men against molestation, in accordance with those terms, with Paroles, it is easy to see how the mistake I am exposing can have been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10203"/>But the convention made between <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00829.02282" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00829.02283" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was not a mere release of prisoners on parole; nor, indeed, had it anything to do with prisoners, for none of the officers and men of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00829.02284" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> <hi rend="italics">ever were prisoners</hi>, as may be seen at a glance by an inspection of the terms of the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10204"/>It was a treaty between commanding generals in the field, in which the word <hi rend="italics">parole</hi> is not once used, or could be used with propriety; a treaty in which mutual stipulations are made, <num value="1">one</num> in consideration of another, and there is no limit as to time set to this treaty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10205"/>On the contrary, it was expressly stated that the guaranties contained in it were to continue and be in force, so long as the parties to whom the guaranties were given, should perform their part of the treaty stipulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10206"/>It was made, not in contemplation of a continuation of the war, but with a view to put an end to the war, and the guaranties were demanded by us as <hi rend="italics">peace guaranties</hi>. It <pb id="p.830" n="830"/> did, in effect, put an end to the war and pacify the whole country; <persName n="Taylor,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02285" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,Dick,,,:3"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02286" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> and others in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, following the lead of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02287" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10207"/>Are we to be told now by an <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, that the moment the object of the convention, to wit, the restoration of peace, was accomplished, the convention itself became a nullity, its terms powerless to protect us, and that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02288" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> surrendered, in fact, without any terms whatever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10208"/>You cannot sustain such an opinion, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President.</rs> It will shock the common sense and love of fair play of the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10209"/>But to show still further that it was the intention of the parties that this should be a <hi rend="italics">continuing</hi> convention, the words used were, <q direct="unspecified">not to be disturbed by the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Authorities</hi>,</q> these words being co-extensive with the whole power of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10210"/>We were not only <q direct="unspecified">not to be disturbed</q> by <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02289" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, or any other military commander or authority, but by <hi rend="italics">any authority whatever</hi>, civil or military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10211"/>Nor will it do to say that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02290" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, being merely a military man, had no authority to speak for the civil branch of the <rs>Government</rs>, for his action, as we have seen, was approved by the <name>Administration</name> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 6" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10212"/><num value="1">One</num> more remark, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, and I will forbear to trespass further on your time and patience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10213"/>The act of war for which I was arrested, was well known to the <name>Department</name> of the <rs>Government</rs> making the arrest, <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> before the convention was entered into at <placeName reg="Greensboroa">Greensboroa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10214"/>It was also well known to the same Department, that about the middle of <dateStruct value="1865-02-"><month reg="02">February</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, I was assigned to the command of the <orgName n="James River Squadron" type="squadron">James River Squadron</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, with the rank of a rear-admiral; being thus promoted and employed by my Government, after the alleged illegal escape off <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10215"/>If the <rs>Federal Government</rs> then entertained the design, which it has since developed, of arresting and trying me for this alleged breach of the laws of war, was it not its duty, both to itself and to me, to have made me an exception to any military terms it might have been disposed to grant to our armies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10216"/>I put it to you, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, as a man and a magistrate to say, and I will rest my case on your answer, whether it was consistent with honor and fair dealing, for this Government <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to entrap me, by means of a <orgName n="Military Convention" type="convention">military convention</orgName>, and then, having me in its power, to arrest me and declare that convention null and void, for the course recommended to you by <persName n="Speed,Mister,,,," id="n0133.0059.00830.02291" reg="mostcommon:Speed,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Speed</surname></persName> comes to this&mdash;nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10219"/>We live in times of high party excitement, when men, unfortunately, are but too prone to take counsel of their passions; but passions die, and men die with them, and after death comes history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10221"/>In this paper I have stood strictly upon legal defences; but should those barriers be beaten down, conscious of the rectitude of my conduct, throughout a checkered and eventful career, when the commerce of half a world was at my mercy, and when the passions of men, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, were tossed into a whirlwind, by the current events of the most bloody and terrific war that the human race had ever seen, I shall hope to justify and defend myself against any and all charges affecting the honor and reputation of a man and a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10229"/>As long ago as last <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> commenced an earnest effort to initiate the trials of prominent traitors, beginning with the arch-traitor <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0133.0059.00831.02295" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10230"/>It is now a historical record, and officially in the possession of the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, that, upon application to the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> to know at what time, if any, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Court for the <orgName n="District of Virginia" type="district">District of Virginia</orgName> would be ready to try certain high crimes against the <rs>National Government</rs>, the <rs>President</rs> received an answer from <persName n="Chase,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0133.0059.00831.02296" reg="mostcommon:Chase,William,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, that the <rs type="place">Court</rs> would not sit in that district, while that territory was under military control, and suggested the propriety of delaying action in the matter, until Congress acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10231"/>Congress assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10232"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> referred the whole subject, respectfully, to the consideration of Congress in his annual message, and subsequently, in answer to a resolution of inquiry, he sent, by special message, the correspondence alluded to above, between himself and <persName n="Chase,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0133.0059.00831.02297" reg="mostcommon:Chase,William,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief-Justice</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10233"/>All the facts were thus legitimately laid before the legislative branch of the <rs>Government</rs> <hi rend="italics"><measure n="3.5months" type="date">three and a half months</measure> ago</hi>! <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, <pb id="p.832" n="832"/> some time in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, stopped the work of pardoning, except in a few cases where the applications were accompanied by the most positive evidence of good intentions toward the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10234"/>From among those who have applied for pardon, the <rs>President</rs> has reserved for trial about <hi rend="italics"><num value="500">five hundred</num></hi> of the military and political leaders of the rebel Government&mdash;a sufficient number to begin with at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10235"/>This number, as classified by the <rs>President</rs>, we published, by permission, some time since.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10236"/>Now, in view of the above statement of facts, what has Congress done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10237"/>Has Congress passed any law directing how the rebels shall be tried?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10238"/>No. Has Congress passed any resolution requesting the <rs>President</rs> to order a military court for the trial of <orgName><orgName type="company"><persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0133.0059.00832.02298" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> &amp; Co.</orgName></orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10239"/>No.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10240"/>But what have Congressmen done in their individual capacity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10241"/>Many of them, from day to day, have spoken sneeringly of the <rs>President</rs>, because he has not done what he began to do, but which the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> prevented, by refusing to hold the court, and which the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> has wholly neglected, or <hi rend="italics">purposely ignored</hi>. The people, through the press of the country, and in private communication, are beginning to inquire why Congress don't act. <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governors</rs> of States, ignorant of the facts, are haranguing the people about the <hi rend="italics">indisposition</hi> or <hi rend="italics">neglect</hi> of the <rs>President</rs> to try traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10242"/>Why don't Congress act?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10243"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> is ready, and has been ready from the beginning, to co-operate with Congress in any constitutional measure by which traitors can be tried, to the end, that treason may thereby be made odious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10245"/></p></body></text></p></quote> </p> 
<p>There is an old adage which says, <q direct="unspecified">When rogues fall out, honest men get their rights.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10246"/>Fortunately for the <q direct="unspecified">traitors</q> of the <rs>South</rs>, <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0133.0059.00832.02299" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and the <rs>Congress</rs> quarrelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10248"/>The <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> was equally disregarded by them both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10249"/><persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0133.0059.00832.02301" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had no more respect for it than Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10250"/>His Mode of reconstruction equally violated it, with that of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10251"/>It was a struggle between usurpers, which should be master&mdash;that was all. <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0133.0059.00832.02302" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, with a single stroke of the pen, struck down all the <rs>State</rs> governments, called conventions of the people, and told the conventions what they should do. Congress might go a little further, but its violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> could not, well, be more flagrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10252"/>The breach widened from day to day, and the quarrel at last became bitter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10253"/>Neither party, opposed by the <pb id="p.833" n="833"/> other, could afford to become the hangman of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and the very pretty little programme, which, according to the <q direct="unspecified">Republican</q> newspaper, had been arranged between the rogues, naturally fell to the ground.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10254"/><persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0133.0059.00833.02303" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> finding that his quarrel with Congress had ruined him with his party, now set about constructing a new <num value="1">one</num>&mdash; a Johnson party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10255"/>His scheme was to ignore both the <rs>Democratic</rs>, and the <rs>Republican</rs> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10256"/>If he could succeed in reconstructing the <rs>Southern States</rs>, to the exclusion of Congress, he might hope to get the votes of those States in the next Presidential election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10257"/>But to conciliate these States, it would not do to hang <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics"><num value="500">five hundred</num></hi> of the military and political leaders of the rebel Government,</q> as a mere <q direct="unspecified">beginning.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10258"/>He must pursue a different policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10259"/>He now issued <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> amnesty proclamation, and then another&mdash;doling out amnesty, grudgingly, in broken doses&mdash;until he had issued <num value="3">three</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10260"/>By the last of these proclamations, the writer of these pages, who was true to his State, was <q direct="unspecified">graciously pardoned</q> by <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0133.0059.00833.02304" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, who had not only been a traitor to his State, but had betrayed, besides, <num value="2">two</num> political parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10261"/>A glorious opportunity presented itself for him to show himself a statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10262"/>He has proved a charlatan instead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10263"/>He cowered in his struggle with Congress, and that body has shorn him of his prerogatives, and reduced him to the mere position of a clerk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10264"/>This is the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> act of the drama, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of which was the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10265"/>The form of government having been changed by the revolution, there are still other acts of the drama to be performed.</p>
