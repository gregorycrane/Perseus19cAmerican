<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>It was the exchange of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>That good work went bravely on, owing to the friendly relations between the detachments that both armies sent to the neutral ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Between <num value="2000">2,000</num> and <num value="3000">3,000</num> poor fellows were saved from spending months in either Northern or Southern prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The prison life during our war, particularly at <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n0174.0005.00052.00607" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName> and at <placeName reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia" key="tgn,2021938">Andersonville</placeName>, was the most afflicting and the hardest for men who suffered it and lived to forget or forgive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>It always gratified us beyond measure when we could make early exchanges of our men before they were weakened or disabled by the sufferings to which they were almost uniformly subjected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It was always a very sore and perplexing thing to all army commanders in the field to deal with the subject of exchanges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>If we should accept all the apologies of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0005.00052.00608" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and the other Confederate officials as literally true, viz., that the neighborhood of the worst prisons were greatly impoverished by the operations of the war; that prisoners came in in floods, so that it was difficult to provide for them <pb id="p.53" n="53"/> abundantly or safely; and that the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The fact which troubled me more than any other <num value="1">one</num> thing-over and beyond my feeling of indignation and sorrow over the loss and the suffering &mdash; was that on the eve of the battle, after the exchange began to operate, sometimes <num value="10000">10,000</num> well men, strong and hardy, could be put in front of us, while our own proportional return of strong men would be less than <num value="1000">1,000</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>In behalf of our men we could not help claiming that it was the plain duty of Confederate commanders to parole the prisoners which they took, unless they were able to afford them proper, ample, and convenient shelter, and good, wholesome food equivalent to a soldier's rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>Indeed, whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ever did maltreat its prisoners or not, it had long been contrary to the laws of nations to cripple an enemy by the disabling, starving, or killing of prisoners of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>The general cartel on which we acted was established in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>Several individual cases arose which gave us much annoyance: for example, a Confederate major, <persName n="Armesy,,,,," id="n0174.0005.00054.00610" reg="mostcommon:Armesy,Thomas,D.,,:1"><surname>Armesy</surname></persName>, from <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>, went back to his State, now within our lines, and began quietly to recruit soldiers for the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Another difficulty arose which affected us more directly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>It was that the officers in command of negro troops received special contumely and ill treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>It took strong measures of retaliation to protect such <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> officers from indignities perpetrated upon them by Confederate authorities high in position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1317"/>Most of the swamp and the <rs type="place">Congaree Creek</rs> were lying perpendicular to our pathway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1318"/>The swamp for the most part had been cleared, drained, and placed under cultivation, but the rain had softened the surface so that on all our new roads our men sank into the mud at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>It was worse for the horses than for the men, so that our cavalry was soon stalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1320"/>There was much of the swamp growth of small trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1321"/>The old existing roadway was a causeway <num value="10">10</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">12 feet</measure> above the bottom land, having deep ditches on each side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1322"/>An unaccountable accident must have overtaken some quartermaster of ours, for a long stretch of the side ditching was filled with overturned vehicles, such as army wagons and ambulances.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>This overturning unfortunately occurred within direct range of the enemy's musketry fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>The fog at the time was so thick that it was difficult to get the teams involved out of the predicament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>Fortunately for us, probably on account of the fog, as soon as we deployed our lines on both sides of the road and commenced firing, the enemy replied to us, without being particular as to direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>Owing to this bad aiming, coupled with the fog, we managed to save our trains.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>Our men in their strong skirmish line became enthusiastic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>They pressed the <rs>Confederates</rs> back, <pb id="p.118" n="118"/> mostly cavalry and artillery, from point to point, and worked away till they found their left flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>Just before that point the old game was repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>A company of skirmishers <num value="50">50</num> or <num value="60">60</num> strong waded the approaches and the creek, the water being up to their waists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1331"/>They gained sure footing on the other bank before the enemy discovered them, and fired a volley into the flank and rear of the <rs>Confederate</rs> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>This move created a panic there and a stampede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>We succeeded beyond our expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>The men, pressing down the causeway, quickly drove away the <rs>Confederate</rs> defenders who lingered after the departure of their comrades, and so we saved the bridge entire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>At least <num value="2">two</num> of our divisions hurried over and marched rapidly a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> when they came upon another intrenched, well-defended line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1344"/>It was our camp fires which exposed us. It was not long, however, before our energetic workers covered our exposed bivouac with traverses, i. e., high banks of earth well located.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1350"/>I proceeded at once to what was called the <rs>Saluda</rs> factory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1351"/>Of course, the fine bridge there, having been previously covered with kindling and pitch wood, was quickly consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1352"/>It did not take long for us to lay a new bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1353"/>A cavalry regiment led the crossing, and our infantry was soon in place between the <num value="2">two</num> rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1354"/>We made a run for the next bridge over the <rs>Broad</rs>, following the <rs>Confederates</rs> in their rapid retreat; but we could not save the structure, for barrels of resin and turpentine had been emptied upon it, and the enemy's artillery from the other bank checked our advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1355"/>It did not take over half an hour for their furious flames to consume it.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1361"/>As soon as all the enemies in the usual way had been rooted out, captured or driven back, <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0174.0009.00120.01098" reg="mostcommon:Stone,George,A.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> began to march southward toward <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1362"/>The mayor of the city came out with several attendants to meet <persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0174.0009.00120.01099" reg="mostcommon:Stone,George,A.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName>, and he, at least nominally, turned over the keys of <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1364"/>There was not much demonstration from the white people, but the negroes gave their usual exhibitions of delight, sometimes dancing upon the sidewalks, sometimes shouting and singing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1365"/>I noticed that our own troops were unusually demonstrative in cheering for <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0174.0009.00120.01102" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,W.,T.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, and learned that traders and negroes had carried out buckets of whisky to them wishing to please and pacify the men. The soldiers had worked all night and marched to <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> without a breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1366"/>Numbers of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0174.0009.00120.01103" reg="mostcommon:Stone,George,A.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> were thus excited and soon intoxicated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1367"/>Somebody had caused to be taken nearly all the <pb id="p.121" n="121"/> cotton which was stored in the city and arranged it in long rows in the main streets, and then set it on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1368"/>Certainly this was done before any of our men reached the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1369"/>The Confederate officers were themselves under orders to destroy the cotton to keep it from falling into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1370"/>They destroyed also provisions and other supplies, and it is undoubtedly the case that the <rs>Confederates</rs> set fire to the cotton and a few of the buildings, <num value="1">one</num> of which was a railway depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1371"/>The wind was blowing a hurricane all the morning so that the fire quickly spread; as soon as <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> houses had caught and began to burn, the flames extended to the others.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1372"/>I had gone on through the city and taken up my quarters at the <rs type="place">College</rs>; but, noticing the extraordinary conduct of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Stone,,,,," id="n0174.0009.00121.01104" reg="mostcommon:Stone,George,A.,,:1"><surname>Stone</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, I quickly sent for another brigade to replace this, and then a little later for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1373"/>Finally, I had the whole of <num value="1">one</num> division and a part of another guarding the city, and endeavoring to protect the inhabitants and save all that was possible from the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1374"/>There were many imprisoned people-negroes, Union prisoners of war, and State convicts &mdash; who were let loose by our men. There were also criminal classes and drunken soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1375"/>All these elements, doubtless, were soon engaged in making bad matters worse, against my wishes and the orders of the other commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1376"/>The ensuing great damage was originally owing to the fires set by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1377"/>I spoke of the depot being consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1378"/>Near that was a magazine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1379"/>The day before we entered some Confederates were said to be plundering there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1380"/>They dropped a spark, perhaps from a cigar, where there was some powder upon the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1381"/>The explosion was <pb id="p.122" n="122"/> fearful, and killed outright at least <num value="20">twenty</num> Confederates and many more women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1382"/>This explosion, which was an accident, may have also been the cause of the burning of the railroad station.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1385"/>The flames would lick up a house seemingly in an instant and shoot from house to house with incredible rapidity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1386"/>The very heavens at times appeared on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1387"/>A wide street was no barrier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1388"/>Clusters of inhabitants would carry out all their valuables and sit upon them, and they were often guarded by faithful men. A large number of our men, who perhaps drank whisky for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time when it was brought to them that day in buckets, became blindly drunk, and hundreds perished in the flames in spite of all the efforts of their comrades to save them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1389"/>It was about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> the morning of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> when the wind changed to the opposite quarter, and after that, with little effort, we were able to arrest the progress of the fire, so that more than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the beautiful city of <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> was suffered to remain untouched.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1390"/>During the night I met <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0174.0009.00122.01107" reg="mostcommon:Logan,John,A.,,:1"><surname>Logan</surname></persName> and Woods and other general officers, and they were taking every possible measure to stop the fire and prevent disorder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1391"/>Nevertheless, some escaped prisoners, convicts from the penitentiary just broken open, army followers, and drunken soldiers ran through house after house and were doubtless guilty of all manner of villainies, and <pb id="p.123" n="123"/> it was these men that, I presume, set new fires farther to the windward in the northern part of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1392"/>Old men, women, and children, with everything that they could get out, were huddled together in the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>As early as <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> there were several significant illustrations of the approaching problems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>For example, after the <rs n="First Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">first battle of Bull Run</rs> my headquarters and staff belongings as a brigade commander were at a farmhouse, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> westward from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria, Va.</placeName> <num value="1">One</num> day a woman, tall, straight, healthful, and active presented herself at the <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName> bearing on her arm a lad of some <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>This woman and child were brought to me by the officer of the outpost.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>While I was listening to the woman's plaint and entreaty, a sallow-complexioned, poorly clad white woman of middle age was ushered in. Addressing me in a shrill voice she said at once: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>It will be remembered that at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <rs>Government</rs> proposed to itself to overcome the armies in rebellion, and save the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, without touching slavery at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>As many of the friends of the <rs>Union</rs> in those States had slaves, it was indeed difficult to deal with the question of servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>On this occasion, commanding an outpost, I found myself under most stringent orders not to harbor any slave property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>In face of this actuality I was greatly puzzled with the case before me. The white woman, seeing my embarrassment, became more and more excited, and soon began to use abusive language, directed partially to me, but mainly to her slave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>The woman kept pressing her child to her breast and with her large eyes filled with tears continued to look toward me, repeating: <quote>Oh my child, my child</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>My heart rebelled against using military force for such a purpose, and so I answered: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>Its provisions as far as they went were good, and were developed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> draft which <persName n="Eliot,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0013.00201.01574" reg="nearbymention:Eliot,Thomas,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName> had introduced in the <rs type="place">House</rs> more than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> before.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>This Act of Congress, which in its plan and subsequent life seemed to grow like a tender shoot till it became a green tree with abundant branches, was destined by its fruitage to accomplish great things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>The varied character of its fruitage will appear as we go on to develop the organization that grew out of this remarkable legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>This statute law greatly affected my own work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>In fact, upon it turned much of my subsequent career in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>As we may notice, it established a bureau in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>The word <quote>bureau</quote> excited considerable amusement in the very beginning, even before there was any attempt to put the <name>Act</name> of Congress into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/><num value="1">One</num> poor <pb id="p.202" n="202"/> colored woman, who had been a slave, came to an official in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and said she had been a long time in want of a bureau, and that she understood that there was <num value="1">one</num> there waiting for her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>By a few well chosen lines the cartoonist <rs>Nast</rs>, before his audiences, frequently represented on a blackboard a sizable bureau with the drawers open and little curly-headed colored children jumping out from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>The serious people of the country, however, were rejoiced that the representations of their delegates in their <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> Convention had at last resulted, through the <rs>President</rs> and Congress, in providing a benevolent system for those just freed from slavery, and for those, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">colored</rs>, who had been driven hither and thither by the operations of the <rs>Civil War</rs>. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> provision, however, was for only <num value="1">one</num> year after peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>It committed all subjects relating to the classes named to the care of the new Bureau, and it put the responsibility for the operations of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> upon the <rs>President</rs> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>The use of abandoned lands, authorized by the <name>Act</name>, was intended to give some revenue to the <rs>Government</rs>, thus hoping, if possible, to avoid direct appropriations of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>The part that was to interest me most was the provision that the head or commissioner and his assistants might be detailed from the army and assigned to duty without increase of pay or allowances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>In fact, the <rs>President</rs> could take any or all of the officials required from the military service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>There was another use besides the purpose of revenue for the abandoned lands, the commissioner being required to set apart for the use of loyal dependents such abandoned farms as he should find in the insurrectionary States, or farms of which the <rs>United</rs> <pb id="p.203" n="203"/> States became the possessor by confiscation, by sale, or in any other way. Even the number of acres was designated for each person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>The commissioner was instructed further to secure the use of these farms to the occupants for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and further to charge a rental of <num value="0.06">6 per cent.</num> on a proper valuation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>This benevolence was extended yet more &mdash; that the free inhabitants just emancipated might purchase the land at the expiration of their leases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>This sort of legislation, in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, was quite new to our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>It was the exercise of benevolent functions hitherto always contended against by our leading statesmen, even when providing for the <orgName n="Indian Bureau" type="bureau">Indian Bureau</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>The Nation, as something to love and cherish and to give forth sympathy and aid to the destitute, began then to be more pronounced than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>Our attitude toward the <name>Indians</name> in <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0174.0013.00203.01575" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s peace policy and in giving them land in severalty; our intervention in <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName> and our subsequent neighborly action toward the people of that island; our national efforts to lift up the people of <placeName reg="Puerto Rico" key="tgn,7004643">Porto Rico</placeName>, and our sending instructors in large numbers to set in motion the work of education in the <placeName reg="Pilipinas" key="tgn,1000135">Philippine Islands</placeName>: these and other benevolences suggested by this reference make the people of to-day feel that at last we have a Nation which cares for its children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>A martinet system always suggests bones and sinews which make up the form of a man without a soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>It was always hard to love a Government which, theoretically, was a mere machine and which could extend no sympathy to people in disaster, nor kindness to the impoverished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>I think we are growing to cherish more and more the idea of a single name for the <rs>Republic</rs>, and we are fast assuming that <quote>America</quote> should be that <pb id="p.204" n="204"/> name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>Every day we hear from the <name>North</name>, <name>South</name>, <name>East</name>, and <name>West</name>, the expression: <quote>I am proud that I am an American.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>It was in this spirit that my assistants, who in time became very numerous, and myself, in the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> work, began and kept on in the varied duties through clouds of calumny and misrepresentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>The reward, as we shall see, was in the vast work undertaken and accomplished in the interest of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>In the discussions on the floors of Congress we see why the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> proposed had so hard a struggle to justify its existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>The friends and opponents of the measure were about equally divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>It was the long, patient, and thorough examination of emancipations like ours in other countries by <persName n="Eliot,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0013.00204.01576" reg="nearbymention:Eliot,Thomas,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, and his singular perseverance in bringing his bill, every time improved, again and again before the <rs type="place">House</rs>, which at last resulted in the law and which brought a positive relief from the horrors which had obtained in other nations in their passage from slavery to freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>He and his committee were never popular, but he accomplished a great work for his country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>The chaotic condition of all the classes which were mentioned in the <name>Act</name> of Congress, running as they did for the most part to large centers of population, was not forgotten by <persName n="Eliot,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0013.00204.01577" reg="nearbymention:Eliot,Thomas,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>'s committee, so that <num value="1">one</num> paragraph of the law demanded the issue of provisions, clothing, and food for the immediate and temporary shelter of the destitute and suffering refugees and freedmen, including their wives and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>It was believed that these wants would be but temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>Indeed, the law itself was only a temporary provision; still, there were matters in it of great importance which looked forward to and virtually promised <pb id="p.205" n="205"/> an extension beyond the year of the benefits designated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>It would have required more than human foresight to have wholly met the difficulties of this dark period of our Governmental history, but the friends of the measure hoped that the experiences of <num value="1">one</num> year of active operation under the eye of our most energetic and able <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> would demonstrate the value of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> sufficiently to warrant at least another year's trial.</p> 
<p>

Doubtless he had sympathetically followed the debate, and so, to avoid the rocks and quicksands predicted, was earnestly desiring to move with care and deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>His death, <dateStruct value="1865-04-15"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="15">15</day>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, prevented him from directly carrying out his purpose; but he did have, not long before his death, a consultation with <persName n="Stanton,Mister,Edwin,M.,," id="n0174.0013.00205.01579" reg="default:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Edwin</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, concerning the new Bureau in his Department, and expressed to him his wishes concerning the law and the officials who should carry it out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2324"/>As this letter affords a glimpse of the situation thus early in my administration, I here insert the substance of it: 
<text><body> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2325"/>In accordance with orders, I enter immediately upon the duties of <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioner</rs> of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/> The <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> contemplated in the order will be located at the corner of I and <address><street n="19 Street">Nineteenth Streets</street></address>. All <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> commissioners, however appointed, who have the charge of freedmen, are requested to make a report, as soon as possible, of the character and extent of their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2327"/>The officers and superintendents in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, are requested to report direct to me the amount of land they may have under supervision for the use of freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2328"/>The department commanders in insurrectionary States will do me a favor by transmitting a copy of the different orders issued by themselves, or by their district commanders, relating to the government and employment of freedmen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2329"/>While it shall be my object to secure as much uniformity as possible in the matter of employment and instruction of freedmen, I earnestly solicit coiiperation from all officers and agents whose position or duty renders it possible for them to aid me. The negro should understand that he is really free but on no account, if able to work, should he harbor the thought that the <rs>Government</rs> will support him in idleness.</p></body></text> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2330"/>As yet I had no organization, properly so named, outside of the <rs type="place">Washington office</rs>, and so by correspondence and officers sent out I began to collect the information already much needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2331"/>This <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> letter was published over the country extensively, and on account of the views in the last paragraph, brought upon me many attacks from radical newspapers which were friendly to the negro, indicating that they had sentimental views in regard to the relation of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to the freedmen; the logical result of those views was that under my circular letter the negro had merely changed masters from the <rs>Southern</rs> slave owners to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; they implied that the <rs>Government</rs> should support the emancipated even <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> if idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2332"/>But the enemies of free labor approved all my compulsory language.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2333"/>The <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, standing between these <num value="2">two</num> extremes as to the negro, entered upon its work naturally under the fire of hostile newspapers and some congressional criticism from both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2334"/>Long before this period of experience I had learned that I could not suit everybody.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2335"/>My own reason for introducing into the circular the paragraph relating to labor was that many thought the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> would <quote>feed niggers in idleness,</quote> as they expressed it, and I wished to start right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2336"/>There was found in <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0014.00214.01618" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s basket evidence that the military authorities were then feeding immense groups of refugees and freedmen in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and vicinity as well as in the different parts of the <name>South</name> and <name>West</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2340"/>Without doubt many freedmen and poor whites, from the seeming helplessness of their condition, like pensioners, were, through this source, expecting a permanent support.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2341"/>By <dateStruct value="1865-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, when the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> had been sufficiently organized and at work so as to take entire charge of all gratuitous relief, by a rigid examination of every applicant, by the rejection of all who could support themselves by labor, and by the process of finding work for the willing, the number assisted was reduced to <num value="74951">74,951</num>; and from that time on, there was a constant reduction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2342"/><pb id="p.215" n="215"/></p> 
<p>In the process of extending our organization through the <rs>South</rs>, by <dateStruct value="-05-18"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, I was able to recommend <num value="8">eight</num> officers for assistant commissioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2429"/>I gave further rules for assistant commissioners: To reduce the distinctive relief establishments as fast as possible, many such having been set up in the temporary Confederate and Union barrack buildings and hospitals left from the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2462"/>For some months before the insurrectionary States were reorganized by <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0174.0014.00225.01675" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, our <placeName reg="Freedmen's Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</placeName> officers in them afforded almost the only authorized government in civil affairs, and so, as <num value="1">one</num> may imagine, the correspondence became more and more voluminous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2463"/>My instructions were usually given in letters; they were upon all conceivable subjects, yet the most important and pressing were to rehabilitate labor, to establish the actual freedom of the late slave, to secure his testimony in the local courts where they were opened by the whites as they were here and there, to bring the freedmen justice in settling past contracts and in making new ones, and to give every facility to the <rs>Northern</rs> societies for their school work, also to raise from rents of abandoned property sufficient revenue to pay the running expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2464"/>Happily, till appropriations came, the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, taking <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> compassion on our poverty, caused the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">quartermaster general</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">commissary general</rs>, and the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">surgeon general</rs> to honor our requisitions for the needed supplies of every sort which each could furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>Nothing then became more essential than for the commissioner to clearly set forth and reiterate as I did the principles that would govern him and his subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>Orders and instructions were published so that all officials concerned did read, ponder, and, acting in unison, carry them into execution; and surely they were so expressed that all honest opponents did know the sincerity of my course.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>From the start I felt sure that the relief offered by the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> to refugees and freedmen through the different channels, being abnormal to our system of government, would be but temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2472"/>But <num value="1">one</num> source of relief was imperative, and friends of freedmen believed that in some form or by some channel it would be made permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>It was the school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>While we were laboring hard to reduce the number of freedmen's courts, hospitals, asylums, and eleemosynary features generally, we extended the school operations; so that before long the schools, which were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in my adjutant <pb id="p.227" n="227"/> general's hands, were given an independent place in the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>Before many days, when the rehabilitation of the old State governments and the appointment of governors was under consideration in the <rs>President</rs>'s Cabinet, the military possession of all the late insurrectionary States was made complete .by having a military department commander for each State, stationed either at the capital or in <num value="1">one</num> of its largest cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>Each commander had under him a considerable force, so that he divided his State into districts and had an officer in charge of each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>In places the military <pb id="p.228" n="228"/> commander of a district absorbed the functions of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> agent and in others would not cooperate with him and give him needed military support in his work.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Much in vogue at the end of the war was that plan of allotting abandoned lands to freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/>In fact, my own special efforts covered the land question for the southern coast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>In order to establish a definite and uniform policy relative to confiscated and abandoned lands, as commissioner, I issued a circular (<dateStruct value="-07-28"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="28">28th</day></dateStruct>) quoting the law and limiting and regulating the return of the lands to former owners; I authorized assistant commissioners to restore any real property in their possession not <hi rend="italics">abandoned;</hi> the cultivators were protected in the ownership of growing crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/>on land to be restored, and careful descriptions were required of such land, and monthly records of amounts which remained in the possession of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>I further directed the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Commissioner">assistant commissioners</rs> to select and set apart in orders, with as little delay as possible, as some had been already doing, such confiscated and abandoned property as they deemed necessary for the immediate use for the life and comfort of refugees and freedmen; and we also provided for rental or sale when that was possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>Surely the pardon of the <rs>President</rs> would not be interpreted to extend to the surrender of abandoned or confiscated property which in strict accordance with the law had been <quote>set apart for refugees and freedmen</quote> or was then in use for the employment and general welfare of all such persons within the lines of national military occupation in insurrectionary States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>Did not the law apply to all formerly held as slaves, who had become or would become free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>This <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> was the legal status and the humane conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/>Then naturally I took such action as would protect the <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> occupants, and expected the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to indemnify by money or otherwise those Confederates who were pardoned; assuredly we would not succor them by displacing the new settlers who lawfully were holding the land.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>Therefore, in order to avoid misunderstandings now constantly arising among the people in regard to abandoned property, particularly after the <rs>President</rs> had set on foot a systematic method of granting to the former holders a formal pardon, he made me draw up another circular worded better to suit his policy and submit it to him before its issue.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>In the definition of confiscated estates the words were: <quote>Land will not be regarded as confiscated until it has been condemned and sold by decree of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> court for the district in which the property may be found, and the title thereto thus vested in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>On the face of it this approved circular appeared <pb id="p.236" n="236"/> fair and right enough; but with masterly adroitness the <rs>President</rs>'s draft had effectually defeated the <hi rend="italics">intention</hi> of all that legislation which used the abandoned estates and the so-called confiscated property; that intention was to give to loyal refugees and freedmen allotments of and titles to land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, a considerable amount had been libeled and was about to be sold, when <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0015.00236.01697" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> considerately suspended the sales, that these lands might be turned over more directly to the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> for the benefit of the freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/>I insisted that these lands, condemned for sale, though not actually sold, were already the property of the <rs>Government</rs>; therefore, I made objection to the <rs>President</rs> against the insertion of the word <quote>sold</quote> into the definition of confiscated property; but after reference to the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">attorney general</rs>, the <rs>President</rs> decided adversely to me and so the word <quote>sold</quote> was inserted in the definition that was published in the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>This was what caused the return to former owners of <hi rend="italics">all property</hi> where sales had been suspended and never consummated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/>It was further strongly recommended by me to the <rs>President</rs> that all men of property to whom he was offering pardon should be conditioned to provide a small homestead or something equivalent to each head of family of his former slaves; but <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0174.0015.00236.01698" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> was amused and gave no heed to this recommendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>The freedmen and the planter could form contracts for rental or for labor with wages as elsewhere; but before the latter could do so his land must be formally restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>I wrote that it would require at least a year more from <dateStruct value="1866-01-01"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, to bring to a close the <rs>Land Division</rs>, whatever disposition might be made of the lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>As the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> held property by authority of an Act of Congress for certain definite purposes, I had presumed and believed that this tenure would continue until those purposes were accomplished; that such property must be surrendered by us only when it was made evident that our possession and control of it was not proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>Fortunately, as we have seen, there had already been before the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> began its trials, considerable practical experience with freedmen who did work under contract or with leases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2634"/>Much to the astonishment and chagrin of the suggestors and their agent, the statement made and reiterated by me that <hi rend="italics">wages</hi> must be free was adhered to, and that they were to be regulated by the assent of both parties to a contract verbal or written, or adjusted from the common market value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>I repeatedly cautioned my officers against any substitute whatever for slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>The assistant commissioners ably seconded these efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>They left wages to be regulated by demand and agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>If you fixed rates for able-bodied men, you did not properly discriminate with regard to differences of skill and ability in a given class.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>In some communities, finding the plantation negroes inclined to leave their homes and go to the cities, villages, and military posts with no good prospect of work or support, the agents at hand were directed to adopt a system like that of the ordinary <orgName n="Intelligence Office" type="office">intelligence office</orgName>; they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> used every effort to find good places of employment where the idle could find support, and then sent them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>Industrial farms and industrial schools, established by the benevolent societies, helped absorb this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>Government farms, those that had been set apart or allotted, served the purpose in various <pb id="p.247" n="247"/> places from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> to distribute and absorb the surplus population.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>At last I urged for such freedmen the use of the vagrant laws which applied to whites, leaving out the whipping post which had still been retained in their law books for minor offenses in some of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>Naturally enough, where exaggerated stories were always rife, a rumor was circulated among the freedmen quite generally that they would finally get somehow all the lands of disloyal owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>The wording of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> law unfortunately fostered the idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>Were not <measure n="40acres" type="area">forty acres</measure> to be set apart to every male citizen, whether refugee or freedman Soldiers, <rs type="color">colored</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs>, magnified the report till the belief became prevalent that the <rs>Government</rs> intended, at the <name>Christmas</name> of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, to effect this division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>Speculators who desired to cheapen the lands added to the tales their own exaggerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>The result was that toward the autumn great numbers of freedmen became averse to making any contracts whatever with property holders, verbal or written, for the coming year.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2650"/>Our officers and agents at once set themselves to disabuse the minds of the working people of impressions so detrimental to their interests, entreating them to hasten and get places of support, and then aiding them to obtain fair wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>But even the correction of false reports did not always produce willingness to contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>And, indeed, I felt that the system we were obliged to adopt was checking individuality, or not sufficiently encouraging self-dependence; but a little wholesome constraint could not in many cases be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2656"/>The people, however, were never compelled to make contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2657"/>When farmers, traders, or mechanics preferred, they could make their bargains without record, but the interest springing from the employer's necessity to have some security for the laborer to remain the year out, and the need of each freedman to have some guaranty for his wages rendered it easier for the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> agent to introduce written contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2710"/>The higher courts of a State, though not admitting the testimony of people of color, were usually fair.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2711"/>As soon as the military occupation of the <rs>South</rs> had been completed, provost courts, a military substitute for civil courts in unoccupied territory, were established here and there in each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>The sentence could be readily and easily executed against <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> men because of the guardhouse and the ever ready military force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>In the great majority of instances, the provost courts decided fairly; but there were some where the officers composing them had the infectious prejudice against the negro, and discriminated against his interest; they invariably meted out to those who abused him by extortion or violence, punishments too small and in no way commensurate with their offenses.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>This he did under a promise that each of the <num value="10">ten</num> would take a class of <num value="4">four</num> and devote the same amount of time to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>Books and cards were obtained and the school undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>The soldiers faithfully kept their agreement; while being taught they instructed <num value="1">one</num> another and in a few days many of the regiment had begun to read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>The soldiers then hired a competent teacher to extend their knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>This good work had gone on about a year when the friendly officer declared that his A B C pupils were already taking, and in addition to enjoying the illustrations, were reading <num value="40">forty</num> copies of <persName n="Harper,,,,," id="n0174.0017.00275.01774" reg="mostcommon:Harper,nomatch:0"><surname>Harper</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Leslie,,Frank,,," id="n0174.0017.00275.01775" reg="default:Leslie,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Leslie</surname></persName>'s Weeklies besides other papers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of school work appeared to all of us who were interested only a nucleus, a preparation for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>Hitherto, donations from the benevolent had been generously made, and there was hope of a steady continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>Hindrances, however, as in all undertakings, made their appearance and made it difficult to keep the official and the benevolent in harmony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>As means of transportation in the <rs>South</rs> on land and water naturally ceased to be under Government control with the withdrawal of troops, it became difficult to furnish transportation to teachers or society agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>Places which <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> had appeared in the outset favorable to education became suddenly inimical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>It was evident to us who were on the lookout that the whole movement for educating the freedmen would cease unless kept for a long period under the protection of the general Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>Our officers and agents, without exception, wrote decidedly that military protection alone could save our schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>Without it they would be before long utterly broken up and new ones could not be put in operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>It was not altogether the driving out of teachers or the treating them with contempt and unkindness which threatened the existence of the schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>There was wanting that sense of quiet and security which is always essential to a successful prosecution of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>Apparently all the functions of Government, both State and National, were already reawakened and in operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>By taking the old State constitutions of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and modifying them slightly to make them comply with the <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> Amendment of the <rs>National Constitution</rs>, seemingly the problems of reconstruction were solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>Everything, for a time, to the late Confederates, was going on as they would have it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>But the freedmen were left outside of all proper citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>They had no voice directly or indirectly in the new governments over them, and soon, worse than that, vicious laws were passed that made their actual condition deplorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>They were, indeed, but for military protection, which still lingered in the <rs>South</rs>, worse off than under the old system of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/><pb id="p.278" n="278"/></p> 
<p>At this juncture, when Congress was assembling, the situation may be summarized as follows: The Southern legislators, in keeping with <persName n="Taney,Judge,,,," id="n0174.0018.00278.01779" reg="mostcommon:Taney,Roger,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName>'s famous <persName n="Scott,,Dred,,," id="n0174.0018.00278.01780" reg="default:Scott,Dred,,,"><foreName>Dred</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> decision, very clearly demonstrated that the negro had no rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>True, they had formally adopted the <num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> Amendment to the <rs>National Constitution</rs>, but had followed that action by legislation which vitiated its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>The smallest acts annoying to white men were raised to misdemeanors, while vagrancy, poverty, and even enforced idleness were made to constitute a crime to be punished by excessive fines or hard labor under constraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>The labor and vagrancy laws, ostensibly for <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> alike, were so executed as to reach the freedmen only, and indeed to many of them the liberty granted by our amended Constitution was thus to all intents and purposes overborne and crushed by hostile State action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>As soon as Congress met, Southern senators and representatives elect from the insurrectionary States were on hand at the doors of each <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0174.0018.00278.01781" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> waiting for admission and recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>But this <num value="39" type="ordinal">thirty-ninth</num> Congress had taken fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>The Executive, so Congressmen alleged, had largely encroached upon its proper province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>The members of both Houses were too impatient even to wait for the <rs>President</rs>'s message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>Combating resolutions were at once introduced and passed, appointing a joint reconstruction committee of <num value="15">fifteen</num> members to inquire into the condition of the <name>States</name> which claimed to be reconstructed, and to report whether any of them were entitled to representation in Congress, <quote>with leave to report at any time by bill or otherwise.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>The contest that here began between that Congress <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> and <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0174.0018.00279.01782" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Andrew,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, with all the <rs>Southern</rs> legislatures involved, affords a piece of history of deepest interest, and subsequently it greatly affected the existence and operations of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>The life of that Bureau was to terminate by law <num value="1">one</num> year after the close of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>The necessity for the protection which the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> would give became more and more apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2977"/>I was then striving to carry out the existing law, and realized how essential to the interests of the freedmen it was to extend the time of its operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2978"/>It was indeed important for the sake of humanity that that continued operation should obtain, not only in the cotton, but in the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2979"/>I further believed and desired that the recent slaves should attain to all the rights of freemen before the existing protection of the general Government should be withdrawn from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2980"/>I had been much hampered by the instructions of the <rs>President</rs> himself, who had now gradually drifted into positive opposition to the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> law &mdash; a law that he was bound by his oath of office to execute, but <num value="1">one</num> that his process of reconstruction had caused to be violated in the spirit, if not in the letter, so as to render it nugatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2981"/>This worthy senator, always of a conservative turn, warmly took the freedmen's part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2985"/>On the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">12th</day></dateStruct> of the same month it was brought up for discussion, when he explained what he wished to accomplish with it: (<num value="1">1</num>) An essential extension beyond the <num value="1">one</num> year to be terminated by a future Act of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2991"/>He returned it with a veto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2994"/>The Senate did not get a <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote to overcome the veto, several senators having changed their attitude regarding it, so that <persName n="Trumbull,,,,," id="n0174.0018.00282.01789" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,Lyman,,,:2"><surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>'s bill failed to become a law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2999"/>Still, all officers and agents, cooperating with the small military garrisons in their vicinity, had worked on energetically and hopefully to meet and overcome the increasing difficulties of the situation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>Aside from its relation to the business interests of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, which were difficult to manage under the uncertain tenure of the previous law, it served to cheer the freed people throughout the entire <rs>South</rs>, to increase their confidence in the general Government, to give new stimulus and a firmer tone <pb id="p.283" n="283"/> to industrial and agricultural enterprises, and to impart strength to the hope of justice; a law less comprehensive and explicit would have been insufficient Under the new provisions <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> were now embraced and assistant commissioners appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>The inspectors have pursued an extraordinary course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>I understand they took as clerks several newspaper reporters, who gave to the press the substance of their reports, and sometimes the reports themselves, before you had time to give them consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>The effect of this course has been to concentrate the attention of the public upon certain individual acts of officers and agents, or accusations against them carelessly drawn, in such a way as to keep the faults committed, and not the good done, prominently in view.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>Erroneous conclusions have been drawn from a state of affairs now existing in many places, for which the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> is not responsible, e. g., they charge to the account of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> all the evils of the labor system which they find, while they attribute to the <rs>State</rs> governments and citizens, in great part, the good accomplished.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>I now come to by far the most important part of what the inspectors have to say &mdash; the summing up of their conclusions after <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> inspection of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, in which they assert that there is an entire absence of system or uniformity in its constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>They have never asked me for a word of information with reference to records, reports, and orders!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/> They have made no examination of my office, asked no reason for any action taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>The records or information they desired that could not be found in the offices of the <rs>South</rs> may be found here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>What would be the result if they should make a general inspection of the quartermaster, <rs type="role" n="Commissary">commissary</rs>, or other departments in the same way t Those officers who have been relieved or were beyond their reach, are supposed to have made improper dispositions of all records or papers connected with their offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>This is all wrong.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/> There is not a bureau in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> with a more complete set of reports, books, and records, than can be produced in this office at any time for inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>They attempt to prove their assertion by the statement that in <num value="1">one</num> State its officers exercised judicial powers; <pb id="p.304" n="304"/> in <num value="1">one</num> adjoining, all cases were referred to civil authorities, while in <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> <placeName reg="State Bureau">State Bureau</placeName> officers collect the cases and turn them over to military courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>Their own inspection reports will refute this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>They admit there is a great difference in the feelings of whites toward the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>What other principle more uniform is it possible to adopt than to regulate the power of agents of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> by the disposition and conduct of the people, favoring them as they approximate equal justice?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/> It will be seen by referring to the regulations from this Bureau (Circular <num value="5">5</num>, Series <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>), approved by yourself, that a gradual transfer of jurisdiction was implied; and just as soon as practicable we have made trial of the civil courts in every State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>I have sought the provost courts, as well as the civil, to relieve me of the exercise of judicial powers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>Bureau officers have never attempted to regulate wages, and no order ever existed making regulations on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>Demand and supply controlled this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>Of course wages, manner of payment, and all the questions entering into the labor subject differed widely throughout the <rs>South</rs>, and, from the nature of things, could not be uniform.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/> Although importuned from all parts of the <rs>South</rs> to take some action about wages, I steadily refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>The following has been the standing order for all the <name>States</name>: <quote>No fixed rate of wages will be prescribed for <pb id="p.305" n="305"/> a district; but in order to regulate fair wages in individual cases, agents should have in mind minimum rates for their own guidance.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/><rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Commissioner">Assistant commissioners</rs> are required to furnish me with copies of all orders and circulars issued by them, and a close examination of all they have written on the subject fails to produce any attempt upon their part to regulate wages or contracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>The freedmen and employer have been left to manage the matter for themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/> They say that schools in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> have been supported by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Their report shows, however, that they were supported by a military tax, and perhaps to some extent from the income from abandoned property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/> They say that agents interfere in an arbitrary manner in favor of freedmen sometimes, and at others in favor of the planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>This is simply a crime, according to Bureau regulations, and the inspectors should have preferred charges against these officers that they might have been tried and punished. ... It is not justice to the officers of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> to charge them with crimes that were committed against the freedmen in time prior to its organization, and to suppress dates and the location of grave charges so as to shift the responsibility upon those not guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>This was just what these inspectors did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/> The inspectors next admit the necessity of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> last year, and acknowledge that it did much good for all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>If this be true, it is bad logic to condemn the workings of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> for mistakes and errors that were committed last year, and more particularly for the year before its organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>Nearly every charge made against officers in this final report <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> is for acts of last year, and upon which these officers have already been called to account by the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> or the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/> I cannot agree with the inspectors altogether as to a complete revolution in the sentiment of the <rs>Southern</rs> people which insures sufficient protection to the freedmen, when <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officers and freedmen are murdered, and the freedmen abused and mutilated, as is reported by the inspectors themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>They say the good feelings of the whites toward the blacks are owing to their interest in securing their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>This I regard as insufficient security when trusted to absolutely without some other principle, e. g., the guarantee of equal laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>For years slaveholders have deemed compulsory measures the best security for labor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>The inspectors declare that the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> has been in the aggregate productive of more harm than good, and give as their reasons, substantially, the reliance upon it of the negroes, and their consequent distrust of the property holders, and the <hi rend="italics">provocation</hi> of espionage creating mutual suspicion and bitterness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>I deny the whole statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>It is not founded upon fact, but upon theories constantly put forth by the enemies of good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>A few bad agents have been sent, and have doubtless done much harm, yet this Bureau agency has been mediatorial and pacific as a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>It has relieved this very suspicion and bitterness that existed when it was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>Riots, murders, and wicked deeds have recently sprung up, but these are in no way initiated or caused by the officers of the <rs>Government</rs>. . ...</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>The principles that apply to wages induced the present contract system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3237"/>I would have been glad to <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> have adopted precisely the same methods of regulating labor as have obtained in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, but neither the planters nor the freedmen were yet prepared for this.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>Planters complained that freedmen under a free system of labor would not work till the crop was harvested, but would remain only till they obtained money to keep them a short time, and then would desert the crops at a most critical period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>Nearly every Southern State had provided laws by which the freedmen are to be contracted with for <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/>Planters refused to employ freedmen at all unless they would agree to remain <num value="1">one</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>Of course, freedmen were driven into those obligations by the same force that compelled them to work for low wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/>Anyone who will recall the current news of the day, as reported during the months of last <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, will remember that all the power that capital could exercise was brought to bear upon the laborers of the <rs>South</rs> to make them contract.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/> We then labored earnestly and successfully to elevate wages and defended the interest of the freedmen in their contracts, being constantly resisted by the inertia of the peculiar opinions of Southern property holders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>The evils in the contracts will disappear just as soon as free labor shall have a permanent foothold under its necessary protection of equal and just laws properly executed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/> From the course pursued by the inspectors, I have good reason to suspect the object of the inspection, as they understood it, was to bring the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> into contempt before the country, and, to do this, they have endeavored to prove maladministration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>On the contrary, I am prepared to prove to yourself <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> or any other candid mind that I have fulfilled with care, conscientiousness, and faithfulness the trust you committed to me; I have obeyed your orders and instructions, making no other objections than those I have made directly to yourself and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>; my system has been a thorough <num value="1">one</num>, and as complete and uniform as was possible in an institution intended to be temporary and to meet a transient necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>Could the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> be now administered with your full and hearty sanction, and with the cooperation of other branches of the <rs>Government</rs>, it would fulfill the objects of its creation in a short time, and be made, while it existed, to conduce for all classes of the people to industry, enlightenment, and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>The work committed to it may doubtless be done by the army, without a bureau, but not with much less expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>Yet, if the <rs>Government</rs> would keep good faith with its new-made citizens, some sort of a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> agency must be maintained in the <rs>Southern States</rs> until society shall have become more settled than it now is.</p></quote> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>You should read the systems proposed from so many different quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>Every plan has in it the very gist of slavery; <q direct="unspecified"> compulsory labor </q> is stamped upon it. The whole thought seems to be, How can we white men maintain our authority over these black men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>How can we restrain them from rising in the social scale; how prevent their individuality from cropping out; their holding meetings; their bearing arms; how prevent them from having a voice in making or executing the laws?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>To the educational work planters, now evidently for self-interest, were more favorable than before; some proprietors had shown marked kindness; others had found facilities for the planting of new schools on their own estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>The State, ostensibly for the education of the black children, in its <orgName n="New School" type="school">new school</orgName> law imposed <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> a tax of <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> upon all negroes between the ages of <num value="21">twenty-one</num> and <num value="55">fifty-five</num>; but very little money was obtained and so used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>It was to be collected at the same time as the ordinary State tax, and paid into the treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>No such law was imposed upon white men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>This State law had another feature capable of being used oppressively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>No person was to teach any school of persons of color without a license costing <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> per annum &mdash; a license that the superintendent could give or withhold at his pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>The penalty for violating this provision was a fine of not less than <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> nor more than <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>, or imprisonment for not less than <num value="30">30</num> nor more than <measure n="60days" type="date">60 days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>If it had not been for the presence of the military forces, Northern teachers already there who had not the superintendent's certificate, though sent by the <rs>Government</rs> or by benevolent societies, would have been fined or imprisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> point of attack was to deceive the honest field agent, by palming off upon him frauds, i. e., wrong men, who had been coached enough to prove themselves the genuine claimants, and so carry off the currency and divide with the dishonest attorneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>These cases were more frequent than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>; but the <pb id="p.356" n="356"/> real claimants very often helped us to detect that sort of crime, and so checked its occurrence or repetition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/>When the <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> soldier or sailor had died, the crime, which was a robbery of the heirs, was harder to uncover and punish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>There was but <num value="1">one</num> transaction in connection with these moneys held by me for the soldiers and sailors (after remaining for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> or more to my credit at authorized depositaries) of which some of my real friends complained; it was putting the waiting money into <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> bonds.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>The use I made of the interest on the bonds was to meet cases where the true claimants had been defrauded, as heretofore explained, and for such other purposes as were by law authorized for any and all refugees and freedmen's funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>All cases intrusted to me by the claimant were settled without necessitating attorney's fees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>After the bounty law of <dateStruct value="1867-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, went into effect, up to <dateStruct value="1870-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>, <num value="5108">5,108</num> such cases were thus brought in, saving to freedmen concerned <measure n="51080dollars" type="currency">$51,080</measure> legal fees, and, judging from attempts at fraud continually occurring, many times that sum in illegal fees which would have been extorted from them on every conceivable pretext by greedy attorneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>It was not too much to affirm that through the labors and vigilance of the officers and agents of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, enough had been saved to the <rs>Government</rs> and to deserving claimants to justify all the expense involved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>By the autumn of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct> there was food generally throughout the <rs>South</rs>, and the district commanders, in connection with their military commands and the work of political reconstruction, were still acting for me as assistant commissioners.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>During this and the next year it was constantly asserted by opponents and by the press in some parts of the country that I was opposed to closing out the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>This statement was untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3755"/>I did wish to close out all other parts as rapidly as possible and have the educational work continued as long as necessary.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3764"/>To further my wishes and recommendations, Congress gave us the <name>Act</name> of <dateStruct value="1868-06-24"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="24">24</day>, <year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3769"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="4Section">fourth section</orgName> gave us the power to retain volunteer and veteran reserve officers in the service of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> with their proper pay, and the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> and last section enabled me to sell buildings to associations, corporate bodies, or trustees; this was to be done either for the relief of want or for purposes of education.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3770"/>This Act of Congress became a law without the approval of <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0174.0022.00359.01975" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Andrew,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, he permitting the <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> allowed for his veto to elapse without returning it to the <rs type="place">House</rs> where it originated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3771"/>Owing to the heated controversy still going on between the <rs>President</rs> and Congress, it was thought that the <rs>President</rs> would cause my removal, the air being full of rumors to that effect, so that the work of reconstruction as provided by the several Acts would be retarded by his replacing me by an opponent of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3772"/>To prevent that, the <name>Act</name> of <dateStruct value="-06-24"><month reg="06">June</month> <day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct> was followed by another brief Act, that of <dateStruct value="1868-07-25"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="25">25</day>, <year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>, entitled: <quote>An Act relating to the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs>, and providing for its discontinuance.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3773"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> paragraph provided that I should be continued as commissioner while the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> lived; that in case of vacancy by death or resignation, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> should nominate and the <name>Senate</name> confirm a new commissioner, <pb id="p.360" n="360"/> or during the recess of Congress that the <rs type="role" reg="acting-assistant-Adjutant General">acting assistant adjutant general</rs> of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> should do the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3774"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and last paragraph directed me to discontinue the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> altogether on <dateStruct value="1869-01-01"><month reg="01">January</month> <day reg="1">1</day>, <year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>, except the educational department and payment of bounties and other dues to colored soldiers and sailors or their heirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3775"/>These <num value="2">two</num> latter divisions were to go on until otherwise ordered by Act of Congress.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3776"/>Very naturally this bill was vetoed by the <rs>President</rs>, but was speedily passed by both the <name>Senate</name> and the <rs type="place">House</rs> over his veto, and so became a law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3777"/>To close out my general work, and to aid schools and pay the bounties, I was equipped with just the right kind of an organization, and also relieved of much of the previous responsibility and consequent anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3778"/>The necessary orders and instructions were issued very soon after the publication of the <name>Act</name> of Congress which, in fact, was to effect the substantial close of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3779"/>Officers, <rs type="role" n="Agent">agents</rs>, and clerks were notified that their services would be no longer required after <dateStruct value="1868-12-31"><month reg="12">December</month> <day reg="31">31</day>, <year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3780"/>The freedmen were generally carefully apprised of the situation, and shown that they must now look to the civil magistrates more directly than heretofore for protection of their rights and redress of their wrongs, and that supplies of food and clothing for the destitute, medicines and care for the sick, the transportation of laborers to new homes, and all aid and oversight of contracts must very soon cease to come to them from the general Government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3781"/>Disbursing officers were directed promptly to settle outstanding obligations, and to sell the public property no longer needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3784"/>All this served as a sufficient warning, we thought, to all parties concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3785"/>But I found that the freedmen's hospitals at New Orleans, <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> could not be abolished so soon without exposing the numerous helpless patients therein to great distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3786"/>The local authorities refused to assume charge, so that pressed by an extreme necessity, with the assent of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, I continued them for a while, and reported my action to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3788"/>Congress instructed me then to discontinue these hospitals as soon as practicable in the discretion of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0174.0022.00361.01976" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, after <dateStruct value="-03-4"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>, was the <rs>President</rs>, so that no unkind action was feared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3789"/>His discretion and mine naturally agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3790"/>No immediate troubles worth the record followed the discontinuance of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3791"/>The officers paying bounties had to be kept, and nearly all the school machinery remained intact, and the military arm, with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0174.0022.00361.01977" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> for <rs type="role2">President</rs> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0174.0022.00361.01978" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,William,T.,,:9"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> for army commander, was still garrisoning the entire Southern field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>The law establishing a Bureau committed to it the control of all subjects relating to refugees and freedmen under such regulations as might be prescribed by the head of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> and approved by the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>This almost unlimited authority gave me great scope and liberty of action, but at the same time it imposed upon me very perplexing and responsible duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>It was impossible at the outset to do more than lay down general principles to guide the officers assigned as assistant commissioners in the several States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>These officers were men of well-tried character, and to them was committed to a considerable extent the task of working out the details of organization in accordance with the different conditions of affairs in their respective districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3809"/>No <num value="1">one</num> minute system of rules could have been rigidly adhered to and applied in every part of the <rs>Southern</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>I therefore set forth as clearly as I could the objects to be attained and the powers which the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> could legally exercise, and left it to my subordinates to devise suitable measures for effecting these objects.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>In every State many <num value="1000">thousands</num> were found without employment, without homes, without means of subsistence, crowding into towns and about military posts, where they hoped to find protection and supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3814"/>The sudden collapse of the rebellion, making emancipation an actual, universal fact, was like an earthquake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>It <pb id="p.364" n="364"/> shook and shattered the whole previously existing social system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>Even well-disposed and humane land owners were at a loss what to do, or how to begin the work of reorganizing society, and of rebuilding their ruined fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>Very few had any knowledge of free labor, or any hope that their former slaves would serve them faithfully for wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>On the other hand, the freed people were in a state of great excitement and uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>They could hardly believe that the liberty proclaimed was real and permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>Many were afraid to remain on the same soil that they had tilled as slaves, lest by some trick they might find themselves again in bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>For more than a year our principal aim has been to relieve the general Government by transferring to the civil authorities all these dependent classes for future care and treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>To this end medicines and hospital stores have been furnished as an outfit where State or municipal governments have consented to assume charge of destitute sick and disabled freedmen within their own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3836"/>No compulsion was used, but all were advised to enter into written agreements and submit them to an officer of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> for approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3837"/>The nature and obligations of these contracts were carefully explained to the freedmen, and a copy filed in the office of the agent approving it; this was for their use in case any difficulty arose between them and their employers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3838"/>The labor imposed upon my officers and agents by this system was very great, as is evinced by the fact that in a single State not less than <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> (<num value="50000">50,000</num>) such contracts were drawn in duplicate and filled up with the names of all the parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3839"/>But the result has been highly satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3840"/>To the freedman, the <rs type="place">Bhreau office</rs> in this way became a school in which he learned the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> practical business lessons of life, and from year to year he has made rapid progress in this important branch of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3841"/>Nor can it be doubted that much litigation and strife were prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3842"/>It could not be expected that such a vast and complicated machinery would work without friction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3843"/>The interests of capital and labor very often clash in all communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3844"/>The South has not been entirely exempt from troubles of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3845"/>Some employers have been dishonest and have attempted to defraud the freedmen of just wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3846"/>Some laborers have been unfaithful and unreasonable in their demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>But in the great majority of cases brought before us for settlement, the trouble and misunderstanding have arisen from vague verbal bargains and a want of specific written contracts. . . . <pb id="p.367" n="367"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>In spite of all disorders that have prevailed and the misfortunes that have fallen upon many parts of the <rs>South</rs>, a good degree of prosperity and success has already been attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>To the oft-repeated slander that the negroes will not work, and are incapable of taking care of themselves, it is a sufficient answer that their voluntary labor has produced nearly all the food that has supported the whole people, besides a large amount of rice, sugar, and tobacco for export, and <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of bales of cotton each year, on which was paid into the <orgName n="U.

It is not claimed that this result is wholly due to the care and oversight of this Bureau, but it is safe to say, as it has been said repeatedly by intelligent Southern men, that without the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> or some similar agency, the material interests of the country would have greatly suffered, and the <rs>Government</rs> would have lost a far greater amount than has been expended in its maintenance. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>Of the nearly <num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> (<num value="800000">800,000</num>) acres of farming land and about <num value="5000">five thousand</num> (<num value="5000">5,000</num>) pieces of town property transferred to this Bureau by military and Treasury officers, or taken up by my assistant commissioners, enough was leased to produce a revenue of nearly <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> (<measure n="400000dollars" type="currency">$400,000</measure>) dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>Some farms were set apart in each State as homes for the destitute and helpless, and a portion was cultivated by freedmen prior to its restoration....</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>In a few instances freedmen have combined their means and purchased farms already under cultivation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>They have everywhere manifested a great desire to become land owners, a desire in the highest degree laudable and hopeful for their future civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/><pb id="p.368" n="368"/> Next to a proper religious and intellectual training, the <num value="2">two</num> things needful to the freedmen are land and a home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3855"/>Without these, high degrees of civilization and moral culture are scarcely possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>So long as he is merely <num value="1">one</num> of a herd working for hire and living on another's domain, he must be dependent and destitute of manly individuality and self-reliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>But the most urgent want of the freedmen was a practical education; and from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I have devoted more attention to this than to any other branch of my work. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>Though no appropriations had in the outset been granted by Congress for this purpose, by using the funds derived from rents of <quote>abandoned property,</quote> by fitting up for schoolhouses such Government buildings as were no longer needed for military purposes, by giving transportation for teachers, books, and <rs n="school furniture" type="product">school furniture</rs>, and by granting subsistence, I gave material aid to all engaged in the educational work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/>With the aim to harmonize the numerous independent school agencies in the field, and to assist all impartially, I appointed a superintendent of schools for each State, who should collect information, encourage the organization of new schools, find homes for teachers, and supervise the whole work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>The law of <dateStruct value="1866-07-16"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>, sanctioned all that had been previously done, and enlarged my powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3861"/>It authorized the lease of buildings for the purposes of education, and the sale of <quote><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></quote> property to create an educational fund.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>Appropriations by Congress were also made for the <quote>rental, construction, and repairs of school buildings.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>This enabled me to give a more permanent character to the schools, and to encourage the establishment of institutions of a higher grade. . . . <pb id="p.369" n="369"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>These figures do not include many evening and private schools which have not been reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>It is believed that not less than <num value="250000">two hundred and fifty thousand</num> (<num value="250000">250,000</num>) colored adults and children have received considerable instruction during the past year. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>Since the freedmen have been invested with all the rights and privileges of free men, and already exert a powerful political influence, it is admitted by all the intelligent and fair-minded people that they must be educated, or they will become the tools of demagogues, and a power for evil rather than good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3868"/>This necessity has already led to the organization of a system of free schools in some of the reconstructed States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3869"/>Until this is done in every State, and such public schools are in practical operation, the safety of the country, and especially of the <rs>South</rs>, will demand the continuance, by some agency, of the additional work now carried on. Not only this, but means should be provided for greatly extending these operations to meet the wants of the whole people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3870"/>Just at present not more than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the children of the freedmen are attending school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3871"/>Their parents are not yet able to defray the expenses of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3872"/>They are already doing something, probably more in proportion to their means, than any other class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3873"/>During the last year it is estimated that they have raised and expended for the construction of schoolhouses and the support of teachers not less than <measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">two hundred thousand dollars</measure> (<measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">$200,000</measure>). They have shown a willingness to help, <pb id="p.370" n="370"/> and as they prosper and acquire property, they will assume a larger share of the burden, either by voluntary contributions or by the payment of taxes for the support of schools.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3874"/>The poverty of the freed people has been in some slight degree relieved by the payment of bounties and other moneys due from the <rs>Government</rs> to soldiers, sailors, and marines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3875"/>These payments have been made through us in accordance with law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3876"/>So far as I have had authority and power I have endeavored to protect the freedmen from all kinds of abuse and injustice to which they were exposed in a region for a time destitute of civil government, and among a people bitterly hostile to their emancipation . .</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3880"/>But careful investigation has proved that the worst outrages were generally committed by small bands of lawless men, organized under various names, whose <pb id="p.371" n="371"/> principal objects were robbery and plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>There was no civil government with strength enough to arrest them, and they overawed and held in terror the more quiet citizens who were disposed to treat the freedmen with fairness and humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>But for the presence of Bureau officers, sustained by a military force, there would have been no <num value="1">one</num> to whom these victims of cruelty and wrong could have appealed for defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4194"/>Naturally enough, in the several historic accounts given by the present professors or presidents, more credit is awarded to private donors than to public officers, even when the latter were the real promoters; yet in case of the higher schools, such as were capable of educating and supplying efficient teachers for a vast field, those officers did lead the way against a strong and decided opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4391"/>He had gladly suffered the <rs>Government</rs> in the war time to put up on his own property, barracks, hospital structures, and quartermaster's storehouses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4392"/>The owners of the lands thereabouts, including himself, had bought in these buildings at Government sales after the war; but not before they had been seized and occupied by the floating colored population which had gathered there from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and farther South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4393"/>A few industrious negroes were cultivating small gardens on the vacant lots, but the majority were of that crowd of helpless refugees that were living from hand to mouth, nobody could tell just how. The owners had tried in vain to get the city to remove them, for their land was now worth <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> an acre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4394"/>They could get no rentals and could not sell while thus encumbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4395"/>My visitor said that he came to the commissioner of freedmen as a last resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4396"/>He was a kind man and declared that he had not the heart to force these wretched people into the streets or into <pb id="p.418" n="418"/> the lowest resorts and hovels of the district; but he did not think that he and the other owners of that property ought to be required to bear so heavy a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4397"/>I said to the gentleman that there were <num value="1000">thousands</num> of people, refugees and freedmen, in the same condition as those on his valuable property, and I could not then see how to relieve him; that I was charged in an opposition press with <quote>feeding people in idleness,</quote> and I must not add to our pauper list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4398"/>Yet I answered him, however, that I knew I ought to make an effort to help him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4399"/>At last, I proposed, as I should have done in the field, to go to the place where the trouble was pressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4400"/>We took a carriage and rode to the encumbered lots and rough structures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4401"/>We called out all the men that we found in the buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4402"/>Many of them did not lack intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4403"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, I explained the situation as I understood it, telling the people who we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>When I said: <quote>You cannot expect to stay here on other people's property without paying rent,</quote> they very pertinently asked: <quote>Where shall we go, and what shall we dot</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4405"/>I answered them by asking another question: <quote>What would make you self-supporting!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>Several replied: <quote>Land I give us land!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4407"/>They seemed to realize that they could not much longer stay there in the heart of the capital on that costly ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4408"/>Yet some were saucy and some stupid; but the greater number appeared anxious somehow to earn their way. At last, I said: <quote>Now, if I could manage to secure you a homestead, say an acre of land apiece near the city, might I rely upon it that you would work, earn money, and repay my outlay?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4409"/>Some of them fully understood me and earnestly promised to do so. Others hung down their heads and said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>The above is a detailed <pb id="p.419" n="419"/> account of that <num value="1">one</num> community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>There were a number of such crowds at that time in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> or within the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, not so pressing, but where poverty prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>In meditating upon this condition of things, upon the evident desire of many of the poorest to do something for their own support, and upon their entreaty for land, I concluded that it would be well to take a portion of the <quote>Refugees and freedmen's fund</quote> which had been accumulating mainly from the rental of abandoned property, and which I had already devoted, in the exercise of my discretion, to educational purposes, and with that fund purchase a farm of large size as near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as practicable, and make it an object lesson, affording what relief it could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>I would divide it up into acre or <num value="2">two</num>-acre lots, give lumber enough for a small, comfortable tenement, and sell to the poor freedmen on time, on a bond to be followed by a deed in fee as soon as the terms of the bond should be fulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>The nearness to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> would enable me to give the execution of the plan my personal oversight, and help me from time to time to secure city employment and wages for the industrious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>I had no doubt of my right, under the laws governing me, to use the funds in question, except perhaps the constitutional <num value="1">one</num> of purchasing land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4416"/>So I consulted the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> comptroller of the <name>Treasury</name>, who agreed with me. I even ventured to interview <persName n="Chase,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n0174.0025.00419.02116" reg="mostcommon:Chase,Salmon,P.,,:4"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>He was kind and approachable and freely advised me in the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>He said: <quote>Without doubt, <persName n="Howard,General,,,," id="n0174.0025.00419.02117" reg="nearbymention:Howard,John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, you can use your funds in the way you propose.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>At last, <dateStruct value="1867-04-03"><month reg="04">April</month> <day reg="3">3</day>, <year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, I issued a special order, transferring <measure n="52000dollars" type="currency">$52,000</measure> to <persName n="Pomeroy,,S.,C.,," id="n0174.0025.00419.02118" reg="default:Pomeroy,S.,C.,,"><foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Pomeroy</surname></persName>, <persName n="Elvans,,J.,R.,," id="n0174.0025.00419.02119" reg="default:Elvans,J.,R.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Elvans</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Howard,,O.,O.,," id="n0174.0025.00419.02120" reg="expanded:Howard,Oliver,O.,,"><foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName> as trustees; the amount to be held <pb id="p.420" n="420"/> in trust for <num value="3">three</num> normal collegiate institutions or universities, embracing the education of refugees and freedmen; the institutions to be incorporated: <num value="1">one</num> located in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, <num value="1">one</num> in the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> in the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">State of North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>The order also authorized the investment of the money, so transferred, in land <quote>with a view of relieving the immediate necessities of a class of poor colored people in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, by rental, by sale, or in such other way as the trustees might judge best for that purpose; provided that all proceeds, over and above the necessary expenses, should be transferred annually to the <num value="3">three</num> institutions implied in the order.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>The proceeds were to be divided equally between them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>I had great difficulty at that time to find anybody willing to sell, and was obliged, finally, to purchase without being known in the matter, and particularly without having the object of the purchase revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>The <rs type="place">Barry Farm</rs>, <measure n="375acres" type="area">375 acres</measure>, situated near the <quote><placeName reg="Government hospital">Government hospital</placeName> for the insane,</quote> was thus obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>When about <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> later I was obliged to turn over the funds to a successor, <persName n="Cole,Mister,John,A.,," id="n0174.0025.00420.02121" reg="default:Cole,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Cole</surname></persName>, treasurer of the <quote><placeName reg="Barry Farm">Barry Farm</placeName> fund,</quote> <num value="266">266</num> families had already been provided for. Some of those who bought <num value="1">one</num> acre or <num value="2">two</num>-acre lots were fairly well off. I found it better to have a few among the purchasers who were reasonably educated, and of well-known good character and repute, to lead in the school and church work, and so I encouraged such to settle alongside the more destitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4425"/>The land all the time was constantly inquired for by working freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4426"/>It was taken with avidity, and the monthly payments, with very few exceptions, were promptly and regularly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4427"/>The prospect to these freedmen of owning a homestead was a great stimulus <pb id="p.421" n="421"/> to exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4428"/>Fortunately there was, during the ensuing year, <dateStruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>, much Government work of grading on <placeName key="tgn,3000920" n="1.000 3" reg="capitol hill, washington, district of columbia">Capitol Hill</placeName> and in their neighborhood, so that they obtained steady employment and pay. A number of these awakened people at the same period united and raised sufficient money to purchase a school lot. The <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> aided them to erect upon it a school building that would accommodate <dateStruct value="150"><year reg="150">150</year></dateStruct> pupils.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4429"/>Everyone who visited the <rs type="place">Barry Farm</rs> and saw the new hopefulness with which most of the dwellers there were inspired, could not fail to regard the entire enterprise as judicious and beneficent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4430"/>The amount returned to the fund and distributed to the <num value="3">three</num> educational institutions, as provided in the original order before the time I turned over the accounts in <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>, was <measure n="31178.12dollars" type="currency">$31,178.12</measure>, and the cash besides, transferred to my successor, was <measure n="10081.41dollars" type="currency">$10,081.41</measure>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4441"/>Hostility showed itself in hydra-headed forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4442"/>The <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> itself, regarded by its best friends and promoters as abnormal to our system of Government, and as only a temporary necessity, was always a source of bitterness and complaint to all extreme opponents, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>. <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n0174.0026.00423.02124" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Andrew,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s course, after he had made up his mind to antagonize the party that elected him, strengthened all Southern hostility to the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> work, and brought into disrepute its most faithful officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4443"/>Identifying itself with the upholding of the blacks in their industries, it favored them in the possession of land, in the courts of justice, in labor interests, in having hospitals and asylums, and in planting schools from the primary to the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4444"/>In fact the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> constantly kept stirred up all social life where its operations touched the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4445"/>It was bound to put its foot firmly upon every form of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4446"/>It was obliged to foster individual independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4447"/>While it allowed no apathy among its wards, and thus encouraged industry and justice, and a lawful <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> resistance to wrong, it became out and out an advocate of negro manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4448"/>That was its theory; that was its practice; that was its sanguine hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4449"/>How could these Southern white people, who had not even believed in emancipation, enter heartily into sympathy with me, a commissioner, as they claimed, of a party of radical Republicans?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4450"/>How could the conservatives of the <rs>North</rs>, who wanted the care of the freed people left entirely to their old masters and to the <rs>Southern State</rs> governments, favor my theory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4451"/>To them, even to those who had confidence in my integrity and in the distinguished officers who were my assistants, the whole system of dealing seemed wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4452"/>It appeared to be cruelty and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4453"/>Their sympathetic minds always stopped with the white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4454"/>Again, the prospect of suffrage for the late slaves seemed to all such intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4455"/>Though my officers and myself had no responsibility for the gift of suffrage, yet we had to bear no small part in its introduction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4456"/>We were at court the friends of the freedmen and had to bear that odium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4457"/>I think these simple statements are enough to account for all the antagonism that occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4458"/>An officer in charge of any district where the negroes were in considerable majority met with the distrust of the <rs>Southern</rs> whites; he was maligned by the local press the instant he differed from the prevailing opinion among them; he was ostracised; he was accused; if he favored universal suffrage and it became known, his life even was in peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4459"/>The accumulations of this odium, enveloping me in their murky cloud, soon attacked my reputation, though, of course, they could not affect my character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4460"/>I defended my officers and agents and teachers with all my heart both publicly and privately, and that fact made it desirable for the <pb id="p.425" n="425"/> hostile forces arrayed against the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> to be somehow rid of me. It seemed at <num value="1">one</num> time that there was no indignity of language too harsh or contemptible for my foes to use. My friends and supporters were, however, equally pronounced and ardent in my defense, and with their confidence and aid in Congress and out, I carried through the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> to the natural consummation of its larger purposes in <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/>About that time I met with troublesome assaults upon my reputation for integrity from <num value="2">two</num> new sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4462"/><num value="1">One</num> came, as we have before seen, through the imposing upon me of the payment of the back pay and bounties and prize money of all unpaid colored soldiers and sailors, and especially the being obliged by law to pay these claimants in currency and not in checks or drafts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4463"/>This work raised up against all honest payers and payees a wicked host, whose sole aim was greed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/>They had accomplished much when they could in any way corrupt a paymaster, stain the reputation of a disbursing officer, or circumvent an assistant commissioner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>This trouble I fought to a successful issue by facing every official accusation and demanding official investigation and trial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>Other difficulties arose from a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> source quite outside of Government operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>Being engaged in a struggle for what I have called <hi rend="italics">the manhood of the black man</hi> in labor, justice, suffrage, and the schools, I naturally carried the same efforts with me into the church, with which I was connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>The ostensible object of the pamphlet was to put the sister churches, over the country right concerning our <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>Opposition now set in strongly against me by many of our church members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>Many points of controversy also found their way into the <orgName n="Trustees Board" type="board">board of trustees</orgName> of <orgName n="Howard University" type="university">Howard University</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>Differences arose between <persName n="Boynton,Doctor,,,," id="n0174.0026.00430.02145" reg="nearbymention:Boynton,H.,V.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Boynton</surname></persName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> president of the university, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of my associates, among them my close and confidential friend, <persName n="Whittlesey,General,,,," id="n0174.0026.00430.02146" reg="mostcommon:Whittlesey,Eliphalet,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Whittlesey</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/>I defended my friends with ardor, and often said sharp things impulsively that worried the president.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>He had a great power of satire, a sort of rasping sarcasm, and I was now and then treated to it. I declared that it was like piercing a man with a rapier and then twisting it in the wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>It would anger me at times beyond selfcontrol, and my replies were sometimes such as caused him to send friends to me to insist on apology and reparation, which surely was never withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>Yet the doctor's frame of mind was such that he would hinder the trustees in the midst of important constructions by withholding his approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/><pb id="p.431" n="431"/></p> 
<p>In church matters, during the summer of <dateStruct value="1867--"><year reg="1867">1867</year></dateStruct>, the <orgName n="Congregational Society 1" type="society">First Congregational Society</orgName> was holding all its sessions in <placeName reg="Metzerott Hall">Metzerott Hall</placeName>, while our church edifice was in process of construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>The pastor was away on a short vacation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>Seeing <num value="1">one</num> Sunday that our <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday school</orgName> was very small, I addressed the teachers and children just before the closing exercise and said that there were plenty of children outside that had no <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday school</orgName>, and urged the scholars to make an effort to fill up our room with those who had no such school advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>My last remark was in keeping with my own constant wish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>It was to this effect: <quote>I will give a present to <num value="5">five</num> (I believe that was the number) who will bring in the most new scholars, and they need not look at the color of the eyes, hair, or skin.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>The next <name>Sunday</name> plenty of scholars came trooping in, and among them many colored pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>This action, to my astonishment, displeased very many of our church members, both men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>Our pastor was informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>He returned at once from his vacation, took sides against my action publicly and privately, though the colored children already there were suffered to remain in the <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday school</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>The church society proved itself now to be divided, and those opposed to <persName n="Boynton,Doctor,,,," id="n0174.0026.00431.02147" reg="nearbymention:Boynton,H.,V.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Boynton</surname></persName> were uniting in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>However, even yet, I deprecated these dividing tendencies and tried to check them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>Later in the year, I was called to <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis, Mo.</placeName>, and when there in the <rs type="place">Congregational churches</rs> pleaded for help to our <orgName n="Building Fund" type="fund">building fund</orgName>, restating, as our early letters had declared, that our new Congregational body would be careful to make no distinctions on account of race or color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>That was <num value="1">one</num> of our reasons for the establishment of our church in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/><pb id="p.432" n="432"/> When I reached home, I found that the pastor had seen fit completely to reverse the wheels, and to make public contradiction to this sentiment in a remarkable sermon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>Like <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0174.0026.00432.02148" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, he insisted that the colored people should refuse to remain with the <name>Egyptians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>He praised their advancement, but declared for separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>That was his own opinion, and though grieved about it I did nothing immediately because our pulpit was always free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>The newspapers, however, religious and secular, took up the sermon, and showed our plain inconsistency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>We professed the utmost catholicity in raising money, but were behind all other churches in our practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>For did not <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0174.0026.00432.02149" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> live and die for all ment Then the pastor and his immediate friends, being vexed by this public criticism, which was in their suspicions imputed to my influence, at a church meeting from which a large number of those holding to the original views were absent, adopted a series of resolutions; these fully endorsed the statements and theories of that strange sermon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>They were passed, and spread upon the church record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4551"/>That sermon there defined the attitude of our body toward the freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>It seemed to me like a wall of partition between races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>I drew up a brief protest, making it as strong as I could word it. Over <num value="50">fifty</num> of the male members of our church and congregation united with me by signing the document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>From that time a veritable controversy was upon us, and our troubles soon became known to all the kindred churches of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>Our Northern contributors almost ceased their gifts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>It resulted finally in our calling an <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> council to judge between the opposing parties.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>When the sessions of the council meeting in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> <pb id="p.433" n="433"/> were had and the discussions of the members of the council, which was gathered from many Northern Congregational churches, were going on and became animated, the son of the pastor, <persName n="Boynton,General,,,," id="n0174.0026.00433.02150" reg="nearbymention:Boynton,H.,V.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Boynton</surname></persName>, the newspaper correspondent, naturally sided with his father and his party, and filled his columns with what I deemed biased accounts of the proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>The excitement ran high.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> incidents will show how remarkable had been our heated debates and how divergent were our views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>At a communion service held in a hall on <address><street n="5 Street">Fifth street</street></address>, opposite the city square, <persName n="Boynton,Doctor,,,," id="n0174.0026.00433.02151" reg="nearbymention:Boynton,H.,V.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Boynton</surname></persName> made some preliminary remarks in which he said that according to the teachings of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> in Chapter <num value="18">XVIII</num> of <persName><foreName>Matthew</foreName></persName>, he was conscious of being ready for this solemn ordinance and implied as much for those who were on his side; but he averred that there were those present who had improper feeling toward him and those who believed as he did. He was sure that they ought not to partake of the communion in such a frame of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>That was the burden of his address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>It was an extraordinary thing for me to do at a communion, but I arose and entered at once upon the defense of myself and my friends so charged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>I was claiming for us love to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and our neighbor, when suddenly the pastor asked significantly: <quote><persName n="Howard,General,,,," id="n0174.0026.00433.02152" reg="nearbymention:Howard,O.,O.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, do you believe in amalgamation</quote> Instantly it occurred to me that there were <num value="2">two</num> meanings of that word <quote>amalgamation</quote> ; <num value="1">one</num> was the union of whites and blacks in church and school relation; the other the union in marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>Whichever <persName n="Boynton,Doctor,,,," id="n0174.0026.00433.02153" reg="nearbymention:Boynton,H.,V.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Boynton</surname></persName> meant, I decided to make answer to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>I had never hitherto advocated intermarriage; but a case illustrated my thought on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>I said: <quote>A gentleman in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <pb id="p.434" n="434"/> soon after graduating from <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, had left the army, married, and settled on a plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>This woman had recently come to me for protection against the gentleman's severity of discipline; as she was leaving she said: <q direct="unspecified">Do not hurt him, for I love him; only keep him from whipping me I</q> Now,</quote> I added, <quote>before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that man and that woman are man and wife.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>The communion, after that, proceeded without further interruption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>On another occasion after the communion, in the parlors of our <orgName n="New Church" type="church">new church</orgName> building, among those who presented themselves for uniting with the church were a colored woman and <num value="2">two</num> colored men; the men were graduates of <orgName n="Oberlin College" type="college">Oberlin College</orgName> and <num value="1">one</num> of them had been a captain of volunteers in our army during the war. No objection could be made to them by the examining committee; but during the session of the committee, the pastor put to the men the same question he did to me: <quote>Do you believe in amalgamation</quote> As they were already married to women of their own race, they understood very naturally that the pastor objected to the union of races in the church, and they therefore withdrew without becoming members of our body.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>A more <orgName n="General Council" type="council">general council</orgName> in process of time was secured and assembled in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, holding their sessions in our <orgName n="New Church" type="church">new church</orgName> edifice.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4605"/>The great labor to be performed, its unremitting and exhausting anxieties, the wide field of operations, the obstacles that interposed and were to be overcome, the breadth of mind and sympathy of heart necessary to the proper accomplishment of the task, are facts which must be considered in forming a just estimate of <persName n="Howard,General,,,," id="n0174.0026.00438.02168" reg="nearbymention:Howard,O.,O.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>'s services.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4606"/> The colossal proportions of the work of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> will be seen at a glance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>Its operations extended over <num value="500000">500,000</num> square miles of territory devastated by the greatest war of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>More than <num value="4000">4,000</num>,--<num value="000">000</num> of its people sunk in the lowest depths of ignorance by <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> of slavery,and suddenly set free amid the fierce animosities of war-free but poor, helpless, and starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/>Here, truly, was a most appalling condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4610"/>Not only the destiny of the liberated race was in the balance, but the life of the nation itself depended upon the correct solution of this intricate problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4611"/>It was a great practical question that had to be met.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>The letter to <persName n="Whiting,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0026.00438.02169" reg="mostcommon:Whiting,William,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whiting</surname></persName>, solicitor of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, setting forth the details of the scheme, has been cited in another connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4613"/>His plan was substantially adopted by Congress, save in regard to the suggestion that the head of the work ought to hold a Cabinet position, to which the dignity and magnitude of his duty certainly entitled him. Then arose the practical question &mdash; who among the tried, wise, and humane men of the nation should be trusted with the execution of this work As has been before stated, <persName n="Howard,Major-General,Oliver,O.,," id="n0174.0026.00438.02170" reg="default:Howard,Oliver,O.,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <foreName>Oliver</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName> was appointed commissioner of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> in <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4614"/>The duties <pb id="p.439" n="439"/> assigned him were novel and perplexing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4615"/>He had no landmarks to guide him. The experience of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> was even discouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4616"/>The emancipation problem in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> was, in many important respects, different from ours, and he could get no hints from that quarter to serve him. The failures of the past were before him, and as he thought of the causes of them, he could get but little consolation from those sources, so he addressed himself boldly to the work before him from a new standpoint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4617"/>The impulses of freedom and progress were controlling the national mind; and, trusting to those impulses, he went to work on the principle that only <quote>ideas save races.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4618"/>If the negroes were to be saved and were to benefit civilization, it was to be only by making them self-relying and responsible citizens.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempts therefore were to prevent pauperism, to make the freedmen and their families understand that charity should be considered odious by them, that they should work to support themselves and families, and that they should be educated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>The <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>, at the close of the war, was the representative at the <rs>South</rs> of the best ideas of the country, promoting peace and ordaining justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>What it accomplished in this respect exceeded the expectations of its most sanguine advocates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/> Let it be further remembered, to the credit of the colored race, and of the inspiration that prompted <persName n="Howard,General,,,," id="n0174.0026.00439.02171" reg="nearbymention:Howard,Oliver,O.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>'s plans, that not <num value="1">one</num> insurrection, not <num value="1">one</num> murder, has occurred on the part of the negroes in revenge for <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>Yet the <num value="2">two</num> races have lived side by side, in the same neighborhoods, looking into each other's eyes, while this wonderful transformation has been going on. What a different <pb id="p.440" n="440"/> spectacle presents itself on the blood-drenched sands of the <name>Antilles</name> under <name>French</name> rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>Ours was the substitution of moral for brute force.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>It may be well to state, in this connection, that it was in a freedmen's court that colored persons were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> admitted to testify in any of the late slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>To-day all the courts are open to them, and a colored senator sits at the other end of the <rs>Capitol</rs> and assists in making laws for those courts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>Not less potent has been the influence of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> on the labor question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>At the close of the war famine looked the <rs>South</rs> in the face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>There was a cry for bread throughout the <rs>Southern</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>It was sneeringly said by the enemies of emancipation that the negro would not labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>Satisfied by the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs> that contracts would be enforced, that justice would be administered, with words of encouragement whispered in his ear, the negro went to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>The battle-plowed, trampled fields of the <rs>South</rs> yielded a wealth of production that seemed not the result of human labor, but as if <quote> earth had again grown quick with <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> creating breath.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>No <num value="13000000">thirteen millions</num> of dollars were ever more wisely spent; yet from the beginning this scheme has encountered the bitterest opposition and the most unrelenting hate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>Scoffed at <pb id="p.442" n="442"/> like a thing of shame, often struck and sorely wounded, sometimes in the house of its friends, apologized for rather than defended; yet with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on its side, the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> has triumphed; civilization has received a new impulse, and the friends of humanity may well rejoice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>The evidence which he adduced was not evidence tending to establish the accusation, but was, nearly all of it, merely experimental --an inquiry by the person calling the witness into the details of transactions of which he seemed to have neither accurate knowledge nor information.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5115"/>I found it the hardest office to fill that I had ever had. There is a beautiful outside to the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>: everything goes on with regularity and order, and every professor and assistant professor and officer does his duty as fully as any officer in the service, but I found at that time a social undercurrent that was not so pleasant, and that the superintendent had something to do besides the ordinary work of commanding a department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5116"/>A majority of the officers were strongly opposed to its remaining a department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>They in general wanted to get it back to where it was, under the charge of the engineers of the army with an engineer officer as superintendent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5118"/>Indeed, there was extraordinary fretting when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officer</rs> was assigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5119"/>I was the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5120"/>The opposition had gathered strength with time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5121"/>It was not open, but secret, and consisted in correspondence with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, with the head of the army, and with all officers who had in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> anything to do with the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5122"/>There had always been opposition to the change, and perhaps it was well that, ending with my administration, the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, which consisted of the corps of cadets and other organizations, with all the population of the reservation, should again be put under charge of an officer of lower rank than myself, and cease forever to be a military department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5123"/>In fact, it requires less machinery and perhaps more direct responsibility on the part of the superintendent, who could have no other help than the academic staff proper.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5124"/><num value="1">One</num> change I had made that gave me a good deal <pb id="p.488" n="488"/> of satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5125"/>It was with the chaplain, that he might come into more immediate contact with the cadets, and that they should have the privilege of going directly to him at all times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5126"/>To this end he was given rooms in the cadet barracks, and there he invited the confidence of the cadets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5127"/>The meetings for social religious exercises had been retained ever since I had established them before the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5128"/>Another change which caused me a good deal of heartache was to do away with the system that had been in vogue so long at the mess hall, of treating the cadets to very indifferent fare and reasoning that they ought to be kept to the rations of the enlisted men. In fact, the rations of the men at the different posts in the army in the time of peace had been improved by their company gardens, by their sale of bread, and by other means until they were far ahead of the cadet mess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5129"/>True, the cadets had a garden, but in some way everything touching their food was unsatisfactory to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5130"/>I recommended that the veteran purveyor of the mess be retired, and properly paid, and that an officer, <persName n="Spurgin,,William,F.,," id="n0174.0030.00488.02352" reg="default:Spurgin,William,F.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Spurgin</surname></persName>, be detailed in his place, and have the whole charge of the cadets' commissary, garden, and mess hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5131"/>I had had a long experience with <persName n="Spurgin,,,,," id="n0174.0030.00488.02353" reg="nearbymention:Spurgin,William,F.,,"><surname>Spurgin</surname></persName> in the <rs>West</rs> and knew what he could do. He came and took hold of the work as nobody had ever done before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5132"/>His efforts were so productive of good results that the cadets very soon called him <quote><persName n="Spurgin,General,,,," id="n0174.0030.00488.02354" reg="nearbymention:Spurgin,William,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Spurgin</surname></persName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5133"/>His theory was to give them the best possible of everything, and while he improved their table extraordinarily, he managed to diminish and not increase the expenses.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5134"/>I found again that the windows of what we used to <pb id="p.489" n="489"/> call <quote>The <rs type="place">New Barracks</rs>,</quote> having small diamond panes of glass, brought so little light into the cadets' rooms, that it was positively injurious to their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5135"/>It was not long before I had those properly replaced by good windows with large panes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5136"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reached the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, owing to a few things in the previous administration in which the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officer</rs> had striven to give the cadets more and more privileges with a view of relieving as much as possible the great severity of what had been called <quote>the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> system</quote> of merit and demerit, the cadets had not realized what was being done for them, and were not appreciative of the favorable changes enjoyed; these they could not comprehend as well as the officers who had been there before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5137"/>Boylike, on several occasions they showed themselves careless of their privileges, and taking advantage of the relaxation of discipline did several mischievous things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5138"/>On <num value="1">one</num> holiday, for example, they brought in the night a cannon and a cow into a tower of <num value="1">one</num> of the buildings; and the next morning a cow's head was seen out of the window of an upper story.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5139"/>Immediately, of course, there was an investigation, but the cadets would not betray each other, so that the mischief makers were unknown to the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5140"/>At once there was a resumption of the old severe discipline, and, in fact, it was increased so that after going into barracks cadets were required, contrary to usage, to walk post as sentries all night in the barrack halls; commissioned instructors were ordered to live in the barracks so that every division should have at least <num value="1">one</num> army officer constantly on the watch to supervise and report delinquencies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5141"/>What resulted from this sudden severity, indicated <pb id="p.490" n="490"/> by the cases I have given, affected the character of the corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5142"/>I found young men who happened to be seen off limits running to cover, skulking, and hiding behind logs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5143"/>It seemed to be just the thing to do to avoid an officer and deceive him, and break the regulations without scruple.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5144"/>On <dateStruct value="-02-22"><month reg="02">February</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, after I took command, I gave an address to the corps of cadets upon the character of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0174.0030.00490.02355" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:2"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, and showed them plainly what I thought of the conduct described, and I told them how much ashamed their friends were of this evident want of manliness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5145"/>I said further, that I proposed to relieve them of the stringency that had been put upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5146"/>The guards would be as they formerly were, and-taken off at <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> at night; the instructors should take up their quarters elsewhere, and no officer be allowed to report them from behind windows and sheltered places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5147"/>I wished them to respond to this leniency by their courage and manliness, and I was going to trust them, as cadets had always been trusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5148"/>The response was immediate, and I never had cause to regret this method of effecting the change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5149"/>I studied very hard while superintendent to relieve the overpressure of <quote>the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> system,</quote> particularly of the demerit part, but was never able myself to bring about any considerable change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5150"/>There is no relief from its severity except in the kindness of the officers who are in charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5151"/>I cannot help thinking that better results would be obtained at <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> by any system that leans strongly to trusting the young men. This is found to be the case in colleges and universities <pb id="p.491" n="491"/> where there is no demerit roll kept and no daily public cation of delinquencies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5152"/>Those who favor the <rs type="place">West Point</rs> system, however, claim that there are no nobler men produced than there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5153"/>That may be true, yet the production of manliness may be due to something else than the terror that is constantly experienced when a young man is listening for his name at every evening roll call.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5154"/>I did, indeed, save quite a number of young men to the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName> who would have been dismissed for having exceeded the allowed demerits, by having them write excuses and so reduce the number within the appointed limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5155"/>Some of these young men are today the noblest and ablest we have in public service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5156"/>In the fall of <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct> I was ordered to take command of the <orgName n="Platte Department" type="department">Department of the Platte</orgName>, with headquarters at <placeName reg="Omaha, Douglas, Nebraska" key="tgn,7014285">Omaha, Neb.</placeName> That department consisted of <placeName reg="Iowa" key="tgn,7007253">Iowa</placeName>, <placeName reg="Nebraska" key="tgn,7007525">Nebraska</placeName>, <placeName reg="Wyoming" key="tgn,7007923">Wyoming</placeName>, <placeName reg="Utah" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>, and a part of <placeName reg="Idaho" key="tgn,7007250">Idaho</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5158"/>This department has to do with various <name>Indian</name> tribes and reservations, and the military posts were located with a view to looking after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5161"/>These Chinamen were driven out of their homes and large numbers of them were maltreated; several of them were killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5162"/>The riot was so serious that I sent troops to the spot who built themselves small huts, and, to keep the peace and assert the authority of the <rs>Government</rs>, remained there several months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5257"/>Easter Day afforded us a delightful song service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5258"/>When the sea was calm and the sun shining, the scenery, as long as you could see the land, was delightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5262"/>Indeed, there had not been much change until recently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5263"/>Now the <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs> occupation can be felt as you step upon the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5267"/>That well-chosen dragoman, if we may so call him, selected our luggage and had us delivered in good form at the public house, but he could not prevent our being thronged all the way and even after our arrival by overfriendly natives, each of whom wanted to do something, be it ever so little, for our comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5268"/>Jamie obtained some large copper coins of the value of perhaps half a cent each, and he very graciously extended <num value="1">one</num> of these to every man or boy who had been of the least service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5269"/>That was his polite return for a slight favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5270"/>It worked better with him than with me, for I had made no such provision, so that among the irresistible beggars my small change soon disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5275"/>I enjoyed noticing the women sitting back in shady places; of course, thinly clad, but in garments that had seen much service, and always with the ugly veils below their eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5276"/>There would be adult groups by themselves, or women with children, but men with large turbans sat in stolid dignity &mdash; I mean, of course, those who are not servants and waitersthey were always separate.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5277"/>As early as I could, I went to the principal Christian Mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5278"/>The <quote>home</quote> and the school building were just then empty because it was in vacation, so that I did not see either teachers or scholars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5279"/><num value="1">One</num> day, however, we journeyed to Rameses, the place familiar to readers of the <name>Scriptures</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5281"/>As soon as I entered their principal room I felt as if I were in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5283"/>The mottoes over the doors, the few select books, including the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and hymn book on the table, and the <rs n="rocking chair" type="product">rocking chairs</rs> that had found their way even to Rameses; the familiar pictures on the wall and the tidy lounge underneath-everything reminded <num value="1">one</num> of an American home!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5284"/>I felt this more as we sat down to the noonday meal with the family, when <persName n="Ewing,Mister,,,," id="n0174.0031.00502.02379" reg="mostcommon:Ewing,William,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName> bowed his head and in a few words gave <name n="God" type="God">God</name> thanks for comforts and blessings.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5293"/>The <name>English</name> railroad, here as everywhere, was very complete and the journey comfortable all the way. The rate of travel, not then very rapid, gave the observer every opportunity of taking into account this curious country of the <rs>Nile</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5294"/>The unique method of plowing with the buffalo, using a stick for a plowshare, the raising of water by old-fashioned machinery, the activity of the people at that season in plowing and planting very much as the people do in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, took our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5295"/>After all, however, I was disappointed in this portion of the <rs>Nile</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5296"/>It seemed so like something that had been, and of which there was now but a faint reminder of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5297"/>Here everybody spoke of streets that once existed, of towns that had almost disappeared, and the bulk of the inhabitants appeared to have little hope of anything better, and <pb id="p.504" n="504"/> therefore showed little vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5298"/>It seemed bootless in this weary land to attempt to engraft a new civilization upon the old.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5299"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, we found a commodious inn, the H6tel d'orient, and soon after met the missionaries who had come from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5300"/>We found here missionary work going on. There was not only the diligent teaching of children, but the faithful care of the sick in modem hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5301"/>Our experiences were similar &mdash; to those in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> in visiting the museums, mosques, and public buildings where the <name>Khedive</name> was ostensibly the head of the <rs>Government</rs>, but the <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs> commissioners, because they controlled the finances, had the real power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5302"/>There was considerable discontent and fretting among the common people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>The <rs>French</rs> were not satisfied, and the populace in general expressed dislike of the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5304"/><num value="1">One</num> could, however, perceive that <name>English</name> power there was safety, and, as a rule, a just administration of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5305"/>We were very much interested to see how a body of <name>English</name> cavalry were kept in bivouac in some open spaces in <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5306"/>Their. camp was in order, but the men were behaving very much as if they were commissioned officers; they were lying around in groups under shady trees and entertaining each other, with songs and stories, as we were wont to do when times of rest came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5307"/>We found that each soldier had employed what was called a <quote>fellah</quote> to take care of his horse, to groom, saddle, bridle, and bring him when wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5308"/>Surely it was almost as good as a commission to the soldier thus to be able to keep a servant at his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5309"/>It is human nature for a man to wish to have somebody below him. <pb id="p.505" n="505"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5310"/>The next day after our arrival at <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> we took our way to the <name>Pyramids</name> &mdash; from start to finish pursued by an army of beggars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5311"/>My son's precaution to secure a proper dragoman and give him entire charge during the journey was indeed a wise <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5312"/>In ascending the large Pyramid an English gentleman who had not taken that precaution was persecuted by volunteer helpers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5313"/><num value="1">One</num> would aid him here and another there as he ascended the <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four-feet</measure> blocks, from <num value="1">one</num> terrace to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5314"/>At last he became furious and swore at them and said if they did not let him alone he would throw them to the bottom, and I think he could have done it. Our dragoman protected us for the most part against such persecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5315"/>After our descent from the lofty height I was left alone with a guide to enter rooms that had been opened in the base of the <name>Pyramid</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5316"/>I succeeded in getting up several difficult steps until we came to <num value="1">one</num> room in which was found a sarcophagus long enough and deep enough to take in a giant man. The huge casket was made of granite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5317"/>After ruminating awhile upon the object of these chambers and of what they contained, I turned back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5318"/>At <num value="1">one</num> point we came to a sharp descent of <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure>. The stone was as smooth as polished marble and of great hardness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5319"/>My guide turned around and let himself down to the next level.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5320"/>This with <num value="1">one</num> hand I could not do. The guide stood back, and looking up at me smiling said, <quote>Backsheesh, Backsheesh,</quote> meaning a special reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5321"/>I was helpless, so I said, <quote>All right,</quote> and sprang into.his sturdy arms without being bruised, as I must have been had I tried to descend alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5322"/>I had given away all my change, but having a gold collar button, I pulled it out and gave it to him. He seemed satisfied and we worked our way slowly to <pb id="p.506" n="506"/> the outside of the <name>Pyramid</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5323"/>The guide then hastened to find my son and told him that my collar button was not good for him, so Jamie redeemed it for the sum of <measure n="13cents" type="currency">thirteen cents</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5324"/>A bright little boy about <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> old was very attentive to me all day. He led me to see the great <rs>Sphinx</rs> and showed me the curious phenomenon, always affectionately patting my hand and running along holding my fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5325"/>I enjoyed the sprightliness and playful ways of the child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5326"/>My son had given him a small reward, but when we had stepped into our carriage and had started, the boy ran after the carriage screaming and crying, <quote>Backsheesh, Backsheesh!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5327"/>In his judgment I had not given him sufficient reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5328"/>He stopped his crying only when the driver threatened him with his whip, and our dragoman shook his fist at him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5330"/>In <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> we found the heat intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5331"/>The thermometer ran to <num value="110">110</num>° in the shade.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5332"/>We next went back to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> and returned the visits of our consul and American residents, all of whom appeared delighted to give us entertainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5723"/>At that time he was a skeptic and inclined to laugh at those who professed to be Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5724"/>Indeed, it was a difficult thing to be a consistent <name>Christian</name> in an active war. <persName n="Blumenbach,,,,," id="n0174.0033.00535.02489" reg="nearbymention:Blumenbach,Friedrich,,,"><surname>Blumenbach</surname></persName> had criticised me particularly at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5725"/>After the war, through the influence of <num value="1">one</num> of our <name>Christian</name> officers and his wife he was converted and became as pronounced a Christian as he had been an opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5729"/>The other occurrence was my visit to <placeName reg="Potsdam, Potsdam, Brandenburg" key="tgn,7004463">Potsdam</placeName>, where I went with members of the conference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5732"/>After our inspection of everything that was interesting, we attended a banquet there given us by our <name>German</name> friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5733"/>I had been asked to speak for the <rs>Emperor</rs>, who had written us a pleasant letter and asked to be considered a <quote>young old man</quote> and to be made at least a nominal member of the association.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5737"/>When I had finished, he told the story of his conversion and said that he had laughed at me when he was in the army, but now he wished to testify publicly that I had been right and he wrong at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5738"/>After the adjournment of the association and a profitable visit to the fields of the <name>German</name> military maneuvers, I took the cars with my friends for <placeName reg="Gottingen, Braunschweig, Niedersachsen" key="tgn,7005246">Gottingen</placeName> and Elberfeld; I soon arrived at the latter city.</p>
