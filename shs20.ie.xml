<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>As our troops reached the plank-road, you will recollect that a volley was given to the enemy who were trying to rally on the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>I had scarcely taken more than a few steps with him when a sudden and unexpected fire, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> scattering, then heavier, broke out from our men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>I have never known accurately who started this fire; there is yet some confusion about it, but it was fatal, and had the effect, by disabling the general, of putting a stop to the heavy blow he was about inflicting on the disordered enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Later in the day, you will remember, we made another attack rather more direct, with a strong force, on the enemy who had got behind some intrenchments; but we there sustained a repulse, and that about closed the principal features of the <rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">Battle of the Wilderness</rs>, on the <dateStruct value="-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>My remembrance of the affair is that our brigade was advancing in line of battle, and the woods being on fire caused our regiment (the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA12">Twelfth Virginia</orgName>) to swerve to the right, thereby becoming somewhat separated from the rest of the brigade, and we seemed to come into contact with the left flank of the enemy, who were holding the plank-road, and I thought at the time that we were sent there especially to dislodge them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>I distinctly remember the <rs>Sorrel May</rs> incident, and also recall the fact that, as we crossed the plank-road in pursuit of the <rs>Federals</rs>, I looked down the road&mdash;towards <placeName reg="Orange Courthouse">Orange Courthouse</placeName>, I mean&mdash;and saw the fresh troops coming up, with <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0278.0010.00079.01063" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> at their head, <persName n="Sorrel,,,,," id="n0278.0010.00079.01064" reg="nearbymention:Sorrel,G.,M.,,"><surname>Sorrel</surname></persName> having gone to them to let them know that the road was clear.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1170"/>I then advanced the battalion of sharpshooters as skirmishers about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> in front of the brigade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1171"/>I do not know exactly how long we had been there, when <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0278.0010.00084.01105" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName>, riding up, informed me that an attack was about to be made on the flank and front of the enemy's lines on the south side of the plank-road; that <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n0278.0010.00084.01106" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,James,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> had sent <num value="2">two</num> brigades through an old railroad cut to attack the enemy on his (the enemy's) left flank, and that with his (<persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0278.0010.00084.01107" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s) brigade he would attack in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>He directed me to move forward slowly and gently with my sharpshooters until I heard the cheers of the flanking brigade, when I was to advance quickly to the front and attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>Ordering the men forward, we moved very slowly to the front for some distance, when, hearing a tremendous <quote> rebel yell</quote> on our right, we pushed forward as rapidly as the thick undergrowth would <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> allow, but did not go very far, when, coming to a slight opening about <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> wide and <num value="70">seventy</num> long, which looked as if it were the site of an old pond, I saw the enemy's line of battle on the opposite or eastern side of this opening, moving to their right in column of fours at a double quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>Seeing this, I gave the order to the sharpshooters to commence firing, which order was repeated in a loud tone by all of the commissioned and non commissioned officers of the battalion, which I saw attracted the attention of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1175"/>I saw <num value="4">four</num> men just at this time step out of line and prepare to fire, and thinking it the part of a good skirmisher to seek protection when possible, and seeing a dead tree about the size of my body about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> from me, I stepped quickly behind it, but not in time to escape a bullet which passed through my clothes, grazing my spine slightly, giving me great pain at the time and causing paralysis of my lower limbs that evening, so that I could scarcely use them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1176"/>I came near leaving the field, thinking that I had been shot through, but was obliged to smile after finding the extent of my injury, and thought how I, who had been selected to command the picked men of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0278.0010.00085.01108" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, would have been laughed at had I left the field for so slight an injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>A sergeant of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 61">Sixty-First regiment</orgName>, just as I was struck, fell at my feet, shot through the brain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>The enemy's line at this place was somewhat broken by our fire, but a much larger number than composed my force of sharpshooters halted and returned our fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>While this was going on I could hear our brigade behind us advancing, and judging from the sound made by the canteens of the men striking against the bushes that the brigade was in easy supporting distance of us, I gave the order to the sharpshooters to charge, which order being repeated by all the officers of my command, was, I thought, mistaken by the brigade for an order for them to charge, as they immediately came forward very rapidly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>I had gotten nearly across the opening, above referred to, when our brigade reached it, and as the men in our rear opened fire on the enemy before us without regard of the sharpshooters being in their front, I quickly withdrew to the rear with my men, and in that position went forward with the brigade until we reached the plank-road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>Before we moved forward, and whilst we were about this opening, I was particularly struck by the coolness and gallantry of <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0278.0010.00085.01109" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>It is needless to tell that the men were in their places as quickly as possible, and promptly moved forward.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>Ans. The Confederate troops suffered greatly for want of proper provisions, for some time before the end of the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>A small cup of cornmeal or rice was a day's rations, and the men, from <measure n="48days" type="date">forty-eight days</measure> of service in open trenches, exposed to torrid sun and all weather, unable to move from their positions, without being exposed to a storm of shot and shell, were necessarily much worn <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> and emaciated; so apparent was this, that when I marched my brigade by a group of Federal officers, <num value="1">one</num> of them exclaimed in my hearing, <q direct="unspecified">Great <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, can it be possible that these men held us in check for so long a time.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>The morale of the men was excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>They could not have been driven; they might have been overwhelmed, but had no thought, so far as I could observe, of retreat or surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>It would have been impossible for them to have continued the struggle much longer, as it was beyond the endurance of human nature.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>It affords me no little pleasure to speak the merited praises of the cavalry of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>My only regret is that I am not gifted with that silvery eloquence which alone can paint in its true colors the brilliant part which it took in those splendid achievements which have made immortal the army to which it belonged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>I look with loftiest pride upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="3.5years" type="date">three and a half years</measure> of the war. I served with that branch of the army which has written its name high and imperishably high on the temple of fame, the infantry of our army, but I can assure you it is with no less pride that I contemplate the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of that war, in which I shared the hardships and the glories of that gallant band of heroes, the cavalry of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>I know it is thought by some that the hardships of the cavalry were comparatively slight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>Indeed this idea was at <num value="1">one</num> time so <pb id="p.200" n="200"/> common that it found expression in the old song, <q direct="unspecified">If you want to have a good time join the cavalry.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>But I know from experience that this idea is entirely without foundation in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2492"/>I express my true sentiments, when I tell you that the hardships of the cavalry were as great, yes, at times, even greater than those of the other arms of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2493"/>The cavalrymen on those long forced marches which they so frequently took as often longed for a walk as did the marching foot soldier long for a ride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2494"/>In addition to his own physical fatigue he suffered the mental pain of knowing that his noble steed on which he so much relied was suffering from the pangs of hunger and thirst and fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2495"/>And when the cavalryman halts for a few hours of needed rest, he cannot, like his brother of the infantry, at once throw his blanket around, fall upon the ground and embrace that sweet and restful sleep, whose wooings have well nigh overcome him, but he must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and frequently at great trouble, lookout for the comfort of his horse.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2496"/>The cavalryman but seldom enjoyed the comparative ease and comfort of winter quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2497"/><rs type="season">Summer</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs>, <rs type="season">winter</rs> and <rs type="season">autumn</rs> were all the same to him. He must be upon that all important outpost, watching or fighting the enemy, whether the summer's sun be shining or the winter's blast be blowing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2498"/>When you see that solitary cavalryman riding from the front to the rear, he is not always in search of butter-milk, nor is he turning his back upon the foe, because he fears to face him or to fight: him, but oftener than otherwise he is bearing some message to the rear which is to save the army from surprise or the loved cause from disaster.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2499"/><num value="1">One</num> of the principal duties of the cavalry is to watch and inform and, if needs be, to hold in check the advancing enemy until preparations are made to receive him. That the cavalry of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> was fully up to its duty in this respect is evidenced by the fact that there is not <num value="1">one</num> single instance during the whole war where any portion of the army to which it belonged was surprised because of the failure of its cavalry to perform its duty either as watchers or as fighters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2500"/>It is true that the cavalry of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> did not so often as did its infantry meet the enemy in the shock of great battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2501"/>Its duties were of a different kind, but of such a kind and so gallantly and nobly done that the performance of them contributed much to ensuring victory to our army in some of those great <pb id="p.201" n="201"/> shocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>His services in behalf of the history of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> were, as stated in the tribute of his friend, providential; his enthusiasm and his popularity ensured the success of the appropriation as that of no <num value="1">one</num> else might have done, and his peculiar fitness as editor of the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Records,,Colonial,,," id="n0278.0017.00214.02255" reg="default:Records,Colonial,,,"><foreName>Colonial</foreName> <surname>Records</surname></persName></q> carried the arduous labor to successful completion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>An eloquent man, who does not believe in the existence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> or the immortality of the soul, standing by an open grave and pronouncing a eulogy upon him who is to occupy it, presents <num value="1">one</num> of the saddest spectacles this world affords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2714"/>Such a service finds no support even in philosophy, for if death is the end and its victim has ceased to exist, there is nothing in all the wide universe to which the euology can be applied except a fast fading picture on the walls of memory, and it becomes a mere empty declamation to those who will themselves soon pass into nothingness &mdash; a shadow-drama, acted before a shadow-audience, upon which in a little while will fall the curtain of eternal night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>But the tribute which <num value="1">one</num> pays to a departed friend, in the full faith and assurance that he still lives, and will live forever, is a reasonable and a pious service, approved of heaven, and honored among men. The words of the orator in the <num value="1">one</num> case, however beautiful, are but the cry of despair; the utterance of the speaker in the other, however simple, is that of a soul conscious of its immortality, and rejoicing in a deathless hope.

<p>You could have extended to me no invitation which would appeal more irresistibly alike to my sense of public duty, and to my loyalty to a life-long friendship than that which has brought me here to-day.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>It shall be my aim, as it is my hope, to do justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>I would not do less, and he of whom I speak, though voiceless now, would not have me do more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>And I begin to do justice by declaring it to be my deliberate conviction that our State has never produced a son who was more intensely North Carolinian in every fibre of his being, or <num value="1">one</num> who rendered more continuous, unselfish, devoted, and valuable service to her than did William Lawrence Saunders-service, too, a large part of which was performed by him during years of ceaseless physical <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> pain and suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>Indeed, his whole life, from boyhood to the day of his death, through evil and good report, in adversity or prosperity, was devoted to the work of sustaining and defending her honor and the welfare of her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>If, therefore, any North Carolinian ever deserved to be remembered with gratitude for his public services it was he, and if the <rs>State</rs> had not persistently from the beginning of her existence refused to recognize by some permanent memorial any obligation for such services by any of her sons we might indulge the hope that she would erect a monument to his memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>She stands alone among civilized governments in this respect, for she has never erected a single memorial stone to show the world that she ever produced a son worthy of remembrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>Nor are her people peculiar in this respect alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>Ever jealous of any encroachment upon their liberties, ever ready to suffer and die in defence of them, the history of their State is rich with illustrations of their patriotism-and yet that history remains to be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>Prolific of heroes in every war on this continent, of statesmen in every period of political strife, of great men in all professions and callings the world has never known it, because the people of the <rs>State</rs> have never seemed to recognize, or care for it.

Readily recognizing them elsewhere we never think of finding them at home and in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>More true is it here, I think, than in any other State of this republic that a prophet is not without honor save in his own country, and among his own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>And yet, even when just criticism of this kind was indulged in before him, <persName n="Saunders,,William,L.,," id="n0278.0017.00216.02258" reg="expanded:Saunders,William,Lawrence,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName> never failed to eulogize and defend the people of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>He had absolute confidence in them as to everything, and was always ready to vindicate them against any sort of imputation from any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>Nor was it a mere blind prejudice on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>He was not blind to the peculiarities of his fellow-citizens as a community, but he always insisted that with all their faults and pecularities they were the best people he had ever known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>He made no display of this sentiment, and never sought to make capital of it for selfish ends, as he might have done if he had been a demagogue, but he sincerely felt and always acted upon it. No man ever lived who was more thoroughly imbued with faith in the people, and, therefore, he prized government by the people as the greatest of all political blessings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>Bred to the <pb id="p.217" n="217"/> law, and a student of Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0278.0017.00217.02259" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> institutions, the principle of local self-government was precious in his sight, and arbitrary power of any kind anywhere he instinctively hated, and was ever ready to combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>So intense were his convictions on this subject that I myself used sometimes jocularly to accuse him of being opposed to government of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>These convictions were not by any means wholly the result of temperament, but were the outcome chiefly, of study, reflection and observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>He was a Democrat&mdash;in its largest as in its narrowest sense&mdash;from principle, and he was ready to vindicate his principles at all times and at every hazard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>In this respect, as in every other, he was a man of character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2739"/>It is not my purpose to give the details of his public career, but to present a picture of the man as he was, in his relation to the public, and in private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2740"/>I will not go farther into his record as a soldier in the war between the <name>States</name>, than merely to say that he went in as a subaltern and came out with the glorious remnant of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0278.0017.00217.02260" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:18"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> the colonel of a decimated and war-scarred regiment, bearing upon his person terrible wounds, and enjoying the unqualified respect of his associates for duty faithfully and gallantly performed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2742"/>I can never forget his presence there, or the result of his examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2743"/>Although myself a member of the committee, he was my guest and shared my bed during his stay in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 17" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, but not <num value="1">one</num> word passed between us on the subject of his arrest, and no information was asked or given in regard to the organization of which he was supposed to be the chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2744"/>He appeared before the committee, and was asked more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> questions, every <num value="1">one</num> of which, except a few formal ones, he steadfastly refused&mdash;or, as he expressed it, declined to answer.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2745"/>He was badgered and bullied, and threatened with imprisonment (which I really feared would be imposed upon him), but with perfect self-possession and calm politeness he continued to say: <q direct="unspecified">I decline <pb id="p.218" n="218"/> to answer.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2746"/>It was a new experience for the committee, because the terror aroused by the investigation had enabled them to get much information, and no witness had, up to that time, thus defied their authority, but they recognized that they had now encountered <hi rend="italics">a man</hi>, who knew how to guard his rights and protect his honor; and, after some delay, he was discharged, with his secrets (if he had any) locked in his own bosom, and carrying with him the respect and admiration of all who witnessed the ordeal through which he had passed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2747"/>In these days of a restored Union and a return to normal conditions, such conduct may not appear to have in it any element of heroism, but under the circumstances which then surrounded the <rs>Southern</rs> people it required both moral and physical courage of the highest order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2750"/>You left not <num value="1">one</num> stone upon another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>You rent all their local laws and machinery into fragments, and trampled upon their ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>Not a vestige of their former construction remained.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>And again he said: <q direct="unspecified">A more sweeping and universal exclusion from all the benefits, rights, trusts, honors, enjoyments, liberties, and control of a government was never enacted against a whole people, without respect to age or sex, in the annals of the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>The disgraceful disabilities imposed upon the <name>Jews</name> for nearly <measure n="1800years" type="date">eighteen hundred years</measure> by the blind and bigoted nations of the earth were never movie complete or appalling.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/></p> 
<p>Those who are old enough to remember that most shameful period of our history will readily recall the degradation, the crimes against civilization, and the terrorism which then prevailed, and how, amidst the general dismay, the faint-hearted stood helpless and silent before the arbitrary and reckless power exercised over them; and they will also remember with still more vividness how, as to a trumpet-call, the strong hearts and brave thrilled responsive to every word and act <pb id="p.219" n="219"/> of those who stood amidst the storm, erect, steadfast, and true to their birthright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>Leader among the leaders of them was <persName n="Saunders,,William,L.,," id="n0278.0017.00219.02261" reg="expanded:Saunders,William,Lawrence,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName>, and this exhibition of his dauntless spirit before the chief priests of the persecution, assembled at the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName> of the country, and panoplied with irresponsible power, won for him a claim to the admiration of all true men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>From that day he began to grow in public esteem, and to be regarded as <num value="1">one</num> in whose faithfulness and sagacity the people might safely confide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>Soon afterwards he began his editorial career in <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, and at once acquired an influence in public affairs which gradually spread all over the <rs>State</rs>; and when, several years later, he removed to <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName> and became <num value="1">one</num> of the editors of the <hi rend="italics">Observer</hi>, he was a recognized power in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>It would not, I think, be an exaggeration to say that while occupying this position, and afterwards the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs></orgName>, he was more frequently consulted by leading citizens, not only in regard to political affairs, but to various matters of general public interest, than any man in the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>The reason was that to an eminently practical cast of mind he united a rare judgment and a quick perception of the relations of things, which made him a wise and safe counsellor&mdash;the wisest and safest, perhaps, of his generation of public men in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>He was never disconcerted by difficulties and never lost his balance, but always kept a clear head and maintained a calm self-possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>In addition to a natural modesty, he possessed the rare faculty of knowing exactly when to speak and when to be silent, and his capacity for patiently listening amounted to genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>Rapid in thought, he was always deliberate of speech and action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>Conservative, cautious, and prudent, his judgments were apt to stand without revision, and it is doubtful if in his whole editorial career he ever had occasion to recall <num value="1">one</num> as unjust or extravagant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>It is not strange, therefore, that his counsel was sought in times of doubt and difficulty, and was followed with confidence by those to whom he gave it. And when his social character is considered, it is still less surprising, for he was so genial, and gentle, and kindly, and cheerful that it was a pleasure to be associated with him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>I never knew a man, apparently so practical and emotionless, whose sympathies were more easily reached, or whose impulses were more generous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>His strong aversion to a display of feeling by others was often attributable to his consciousness of his own inability to <pb id="p.220" n="220"/> withstand it. A pathetic story, or a burst of eloquence would bring tears to his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>The truth is that, little as it was suspected by those who were not near to him, he was a man of decidedly emotional nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>And, as a corollary, he possessed the keenest sense of humor, and enjoyed a laughable incident as heartily as any <num value="1">one</num> I ever knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>These personal traits, added to the moral and intellectual characteristics to which I have referred, will readily account for his great and widespread influence, and for the hosts of friends throughout the <rs>State</rs> who honored him while living and sincerely mourn his death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>He had always cherished a loyal affection for this university of which he was a graduate, and in <dateStruct value="1875--"><year reg="1875">1875</year></dateStruct> he became a trustee and member of the <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName>, and so remained until his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>He was also appointed secretary and treasurer, which position he filled for nearly the same length of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>In the discharge of his duties in these capacities, although for the larger part of the time a confirmed invalid and great sufferer, he did as much to <q direct="unspecified">revive, foster and enlarge</q> the university, according to the testimony of the faculty themselves, as any <num value="1">one</num> had ever done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>In the tribute which they paid to him soon after his death they used this language:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/><q direct="unspecified">From his graduation to the day of his death he was loyal to his <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Mater,,Alma,,," id="n0278.0017.00220.02262" reg="default:Mater,Alma,,,"><foreName>Alma</foreName> <surname>Mater</surname></persName></hi>, and gave to her the best thoughts of his big brain, and the ardent affection of his great heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>Watchful, steadfast, patient and wise, he never lost sight of her interest, never wavered in her support, and, when the crisis demanded it, marshalled and led her alumni to her defence.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/></p> 
<p>Every <num value="1">one</num> who knew him at all intimately will corroborate these statements of the faculty, for his profound interest in the welfare of the university was constantly manifested in his conversation as well as in his acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>He loved the gray walls of these old buildings, and the refreshing shade of these majestic oaks with an hereditary as well as with a personal affection, and in the evil days that followed the war the silence and desolation which reigned here grieved him sorely, and stimulated him to the task of restoring the university to her ancient prestige.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>But a higher motive than mere sentiment moved him to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>He regarded it with the eye of a statesman and a patriot, and anticipated the blessings it would bring to future generations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>It was eminently fit, therefore, that the alumni should have dedicated this hour to his memory, and have thus acknowledged their obligation for his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/><pb id="p.221" n="221"/></p> 
<p>The crowning labor of his life, however, and the <num value="1">one</num> which will constitute a more lasting monument to him than any that others could erect, was his <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Records,,Colonial,,," id="n0278.0017.00221.02263" reg="default:Records,Colonial,,,"><foreName>Colonial</foreName> <surname>Records</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>I do not know how others may view the circumstances which attended the conception and execution of this invaluable work, but to my mind they appear to have been clearly providential.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>At different times in the history of the <rs>State</rs> spasmodic efforts had been made to secure the early records which were known to exist in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, but these efforts were mostly individual, and supported by very limited means, and they resulted in a very unsatisfactory collection of fragmentary material.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>When the <name>Legislature</name> finally resolved to make a sufficient appropriation, and to inaugurate an authoritative search for all documents bearing upon our Colonial history, <persName n="Saunders,Colonel,,,," id="n0278.0017.00221.02264" reg="nearbymention:Saunders,William,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName> had never paid any especial attention to the subject, and if his health had not failed, the probability&mdash;nay, the certainty&mdash;was that he would have been promoted to higher positions than that of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of State&mdash;the incumbent of which office was required to superintend the publication of the material, when obtained-and thus the labor of editing it would have fallen upon his successor, who, whatever his capabilities for the ordinary duties of the office might have been, would almost certainly have fallen far short of the supreme excellence as an historical editor which he developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>But his painful malady, which was doubtless partly the result of wounds and exposure during the war, about this time began to confine him to indoor life and soon to his chair, and thus he was anchored for his life&mdash;work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>From the beginning he was interested in it&mdash;in a very short time he became enthusiastic over it&mdash;and thenceforward he gave his whole mind and heart to it. The result to him personally was that he became, beyond all comparison, the best informed man upon our Colonial history that has ever lived, while in the extent and accuracy of his knowledge of the subsequent history of the <rs>State</rs> he has had very few equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>To <num value="1">one</num> who was interested in such studies it was a great pleasure to listen to his criticisms upon and discussions of those early men and times in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and his prefatory notes to the different volumes of the <name>Records</name> are a masterful presentation of the trials and struggles of our forefathers, and a glorious vindication of them against the historical scavengers who have sought to defame them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>Nothing so delighted him in his investigations as the discovery of facts which proved the existence among the early settlers of the <rs>Democratic</rs> spirit, and no incidents roused his enthusiasm like those in which this spirit forcibly asserted itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>His sympathies were altogether with those who, like the <name>Regulators</name>, sought redress of grievances even by violent and revolutionary methods, because he believed that underlying all such movements there was the true spirit of liberty and devotion to the rights of man; which were to him of inestimably greater importance than the preservation of the forms of law, or even the peace of society.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>But he indulged in no harsh criticism of those other patriots who&mdash;believing that liberty regulated by law was the only liberty worth preserving, and fearing for the safety of society&mdash;aided in suppressing such movements; for he knew and honored their motives, notwithstanding his own strong sympathy with those who resisted and fought them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>In a word, he pursued his labors with the true spirit of historic investigation, and meted out with an impartial hand honor to whom honor was due, and blame to all who deserved it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>The mere trickling stream of human blood which undermines the foundations of the turreted castle of wrong is sometimes not seen amidst the heat of the conflict and the cries of the battlefield; the mere grain of mustard seed which takes root where the plowshare of battle has left the field fit for it to grow in is not regarded by those who are contending upon that battlefield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>And in that aspect of it the story that can be told of the last <measure n="27years" type="date">twenty-seven years</measure> is a story that will always have value; but there is a broader value to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>Now, if it be true that we were a race of dreamers, a mere visionary race, it would seem to follow that when disaster came, when the storm had beaten upon us until there was nothing left, when the lightning (apparently) of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> indignation had shorn us of the values accumulated during <measure n="100years" type="date">one hundred years</measure> and carried away everything we had that was valuable, our institutions and our private corporations, that we would have passed the remainder of our lives in either despair or repining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>But when the storm came there was left to us <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, manhood and faith, and out of that struggle, with nothing but our own courage, we have fought our way with such success that we can now say to the world, <q direct="unspecified">See what we have done in disaster, and estimate what we might have done in success.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/></p> 
<p>No man can fitly portray the condition of the <rs>South</rs> when the war ended, and I do not attempt it, and if I were to attempt it I beg you to believe that I do not do it for the purpose of bringing back sad .memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>You who are old enough to have passed through that period recollect it. It was not that there had passed over us a pecuniary disaster; it was not, in its main features, that our corporations were bankrupt, that our fences were destroyed, that our houses were burnt or greatly impaired, that we were starting life afresh without money or organized credit&mdash;and any <num value="1">one</num> who has ever thought about it can see what there is of doubt and difficulty in that single sentence, <q direct="unspecified">without money or organized credit</q>&mdash;but it was that we were in a perfectly unprecedented condition in all those relations which up to that time had been considered stable among <pb id="p.230" n="230"/> us. Every form of government to which we had been accustomed had been twisted and dislocated in its adjustment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>We returned to stateless States, to States which had no certain form of government; we returned to municipalities whose government had been substantially wiped out, and in their place no new rules would apply; and yet we returned able to form out of the elements which remained undestroyed, our own government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>There is something in this Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0278.0018.00230.02281" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race&mdash;or I think it would be better to say in this <placeName reg="Teutonic">Teutonic</placeName> family of ours, for that is the broader term&mdash;there is something peculiarly constructive and orderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>We are the law-makers of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>We are the constructors of empires; we are the builders of States; anywhere, everywhere this language of ours is spoken, the very fact that it is spoken is conclusive proof that order there abides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>If it is in a camp on the western plains, there was, every night, where the camp was pitched, order; and he who violated the law was tried and hung or acquitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>You can take an isolated body of us, whether at <placeName reg="Plymouth Rock, Franklin, New York" key="tgn,2588760">Plymouth Rock</placeName> or in the <rs>Mayflower</rs>, or in <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName> or <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, or down in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, or on the gold coasts of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, and instantly a solemn compact is made in which there is an element of constitutional government, and that element set out in an orderly form.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>Now, if the <rs>Confederate</rs> had returned home absolutely without government he would have made a government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>But he returned without government and without the power to make government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>There was a power over him, by virtue of conquest, which stood between him and orderly reconstruction of his government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>Over him, controlling him, was a non-resident power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>We were infinitely worse off than we were when we landed at <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2873"/>We were our own masters then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>Now to be a slave was supposed to be the worst condition to which a freeman can ever be reduced; but to be a slave without a master is an infinitely worse condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2875"/>We were a surrendered army, under a pretended constitution, with many clamorous masters, who did not know what they wanted to do with us and could not agree among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>I do not say this in censure of anybody; I am not recalling those sad days to discuss them; I am simply trying to present them to you for the purposes which I may hereafter indicate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2877"/>Now we were in another condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2878"/>We were <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000000">six millions</num> of white people with <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of black people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2879"/>A hostile minority a man knows somewhat what to do with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2880"/>If you put <num value="5">five</num> <pb id="p.231" n="231"/> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of white people and <num value="4000000">four millions</num> enemies in their midst, they know what to do. But these were friends, many of them persons for whom we felt not only kindness, but unutterable thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2881"/>The institution of domestic slavery was not so many <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure>. It is true that it represented the accumlated labors of many years; it is true that in a certain sense they bore a pecuniary value that was extremely great; it is true that on the large plantations where there were large numbers of slaves there did not exist much affection between the whites and the blacks; but as a rule, domestic slavery, especially in the border States and in the cities and on the farms, as distinguished from the large plantations, was an entirely different institution from either the money that was in it or the chattel character of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2882"/>There were many to whom we owed thanks for many kindnesses; in many cases there were bonds of affection between master and slave which extended back through generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2883"/>We knew them to be helpless, we knew them to be unfit for their freedom, and we knew them to be incapable of exportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2884"/><persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0278.0018.00231.02282" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> had died for them; he had in his providence put them upon us; they were the responsibility that we had to take with us as we went upwards in our march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2885"/>And we did not intend that they should be our enemies; we did not intend to be barbarous or cruel; and yet we knew that their domination meant ruin and disaster, and that we could not leave the country any more than we could export them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2886"/>And so we were slaves not only to a non-resident master, but slaves to our own consciences, as it bore upon our relations to this race resident with us and among us. I avow, as I look back upon the <measure n="27years" type="date">twenty-seven years</measure> that have passed, that the treatment accorded by the <rs>Southern</rs> people to this dependent race will hereafter be esteemed a monument to the courage and magnanimity of our people that will separate them from all other people as being able to treat an humble race with kindness and an inferior race with will and courage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2887"/>Well, now, under such circumstances we began to build again; and yet it is probably a badly chosen word to say that we <hi rend="italics">began</hi> to build.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2888"/>Nobody in modern times ever is at the genesis of anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2889"/>We are always in the midst of the evolution of our problems of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2890"/>We therefore, if I may change the phrase, took up anew the conditions of life under this new environment, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to which I desire to call your attention to-night in reference to the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier is, that at a time when everything would seem to require a new remedy, he had the sense to utterly condemn <pb id="p.232" n="232"/> every new remedy and every new principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2891"/>There was no pretence of originality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2892"/>Every prophet that arose with a new evangel immediately found his religion thrown aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2893"/>We considered that under the new conditions and under the changed relations the remedy to be applied was the same old principles which our fathers had applied and for which they had fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2894"/>We adhered to the same old doctrines that man as man was capable of self-government; man as man was created by his <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in his own likeness and was capable of infinite possibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2895"/>We who had thus been developed through those ages under the power of those principles, were to apply them to a new condition, and those principles were the old principles of the equality of manhood under the law. So we stood unflinchingly for the equal freedom of every man, and resolutely and without division or question for like treatment of every comrade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2896"/>The broad and universal principle was to our future vital; its narrow and immediate application involved our personal honor, and this can never be made a matter of barter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2897"/>We stood by all our comrades; we rejected all vicarious sacrifices; if any were manacled, we felt the chains on our wrists; if casemates imprisoned any, our hearts were in jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2898"/>It was not that he was our president&mdash;our valiant chieftain; it was not that he had shed lustre on the <rs>American</rs> arms at <placeName reg="Buena Vista, Buena Vista, Virginia" key="tgn,2110855">Buena Vista</placeName>; it was not that in the <rs type="place">Senate chamber</rs> he had been the equal of the most august senator that ever sat in that great body; it was not that as <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> he was the best official the <rs>American</rs> nation ever had; it was not that he had championed our cause and lost; but it was that he was selected as our victim that made us surround <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0278.0018.00232.02283" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> with all our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2899"/>So long as for our sins he was selected as our victim to suffer in our place, we bear to him the utmost loyalty, that all the world may know that no man who had been our comrade would we ever desert when he was in the hour of trial.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2900"/>And we also built upon the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> great principle&mdash;the same old idea of the autonomy of the <name>States</name>&mdash;and out of these <num value="2">two</num> principles we worked our salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2901"/>Of course there were all the private hardships which war and disaster bring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2902"/>When we recall that period&mdash;the men who returned to their homes and found nothing but ruins and their families&mdash;when we recall what the women of the <rs>South</rs> did during those times, we can scarcely repress our tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2903"/>I have had it beat into my ears that in olden times the life of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was an idle life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2904"/>It never was true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2905"/>There never was a time <pb id="p.233" n="233"/> when the <rs>Southern</rs> matron was not the typical busy woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2906"/>She who nursed the sick, laid out the dead for burial, of all the women of the time was the type of the woman that gives to man happiness and morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2907"/>And when the time of trial came, her daughters showed themselves worthy of her training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2908"/>Who ever saw a Southern wife, mother, sister or sweetheart in those days whose face was not wreathed in smiles, that he whom she loved might think that she was comfortable and happy?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2909"/>On these <num value="2">two</num> great principles&mdash;the equality of man and the autonomy of the <name>States</name>&mdash;we went to work carefully, laboriously, patiently, yet manfully, and yet under circumstances that seemed daily to grow worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2910"/>Military rule became so commingled with orgies of a complex masterhood that we can look back upon that period scarcely yet with patience and hardly without a smile; the traversities upon Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0278.0018.00233.02284" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> legislation; the so-called legislatures of some of the <rs>Southern States</rs> where the white men who participated in the government gave the ignorance of the black men credit by his associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2911"/>And then, amidst conditions which were thus overwhelming, we are paying a war tribute than which no nation has ever paid so great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2912"/>Has any <num value="1">one</num> ever estimated the war tribute which the <rs>Southern</rs> people paid?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2913"/>At <num value="1">one</num> fell swoop was confiscated whatever money had been involved in the purchase of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2914"/>There was no war debt owned by the <rs>South</rs>, yet we paid our share of it. No pensions were granted in that section, yet we paid our share of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2915"/>Without murmuring, without making any special row about it, day by day, in innumerable forms, we paid this war tribute.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2916"/>And what have we done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2917"/>I cannot tell you&mdash;no figures can tell you&mdash;what we have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2918"/>But we have done this, to start with: There were <num value="11">eleven</num> States that had been made provinces, and we made these States again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2919"/>There is not in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> to day, thanks be to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, a single spot where there is any doubt of the administration of the law according to the olden traditions of <name>English</name> liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2920"/>There is no place to-day in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> where the officer of the law, with the warrant signed by the proper official and with the seal of the <rs>State</rs> upon it, does not know his duty, and the person to whom he goes does not submit to his act. Civil law is dominant in every part of this land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2921"/>We have restored to the generation to come after us civil liberty in its broadest sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2922"/>The courts are open to the humblest suitor; honest judges preside over them; honest juries sit in the jury-box.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2923"/><pb id="p.234" n="234"/> Our officers are chosen according to the prescribed form, the lawmakers are selected by those who obey the laws, and all over that Southern land, wherever to night there is a home, it may send up its praises to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that the ex-Confederates are a law-making, as well as a law-abiding people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2924"/>Another thing we have done is that out of our poverty we have more than restored our old educational institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2925"/>We have in every State a university and colleges, and in every State a system of free schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2926"/>Wherever in that South there is a child who wants an education, we have furnished him with the means to get that education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2927"/>Your <orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName>, with all the credit that can be given it, finds fit competitors in every part of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2928"/>We have said to Science: <q direct="unspecified">You are our mistress; come and dwell among us.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2929"/>We have adorned her with the gems of our love and crowned her with the jewels of our benedictions, that she might enrich us with her smiles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2930"/>And to night I can truly say, that for our means and according to our circumstances there is no part of the world that furnishes so ample, so free, and so many means for education as the <rs>South</rs> which formed the late Confederacy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2931"/>Another thing we did: Formerly we were an agricultural people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2932"/>There was no reason why we should do anything but till the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2933"/>It was the richest soil in the world; it lay under the most fruitful sun. How teeming the lands of the <rs>South</rs> were in those days!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2934"/>It was a new country&mdash;so new that you never wore its freshness off. We worked, as it were, in the twilight of the dawn, before the sun was warm enough to dry the dew from the leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2935"/>The slave labor is necessarily an isolated labor; it requires that the master should live with the slave, that he might secure the largest production of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2936"/>And land was so cheap, it rewards so great, that we needed no other vocation than agriculture, while its necessities were so many and so varied as to give to the best intellect full employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2937"/>He who owned a plantation of several <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure> of land, with the necessary number of slaves, was a manufacturer in the highest sense of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2938"/>He had those men daily to take care of. He was a provider in the sense that the <rs>Northern</rs> employer never knew of. Thus it gave the very beat play to the mental faculties, and it gave a certain leisure with it that was delightful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2939"/>Therefore the <rs>South</rs> was naturally and neccessarily agricultural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2940"/>And now there came that disastrous war. It swept away this plant in that particular form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2941"/>It did not destroy the race, but the changed condition of things <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> required of us a different mode of life, and we have adapted ourselves to that change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2942"/>Before the war there was but <num value="1">one</num> South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2943"/>It was an agricultural South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2944"/>It was diverse in its agriculture, for the wheat and tobacco grower of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was materially different from the cotton producer of the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>, and the raiser of stock in the blue-grass land was different from the tobacco grower and the cotton producer; but all were agricultural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2945"/>The war changed all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2946"/>We have in the last year produced <measure n="9000000barrels" type="mass">nine million bales</measure> of cotton, so that you may see that the agricultural <rs>South</rs> has not gone back; but we have also gone into new industries, and have shown that the ex-Confederate is competent for the discharge of any industrial duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2947"/>The great <placeName reg="Appalachian">Appalachian</placeName> range, whose bosom has been throbbing with eager and expectant yearning that we might obtain its riches, is now being turned into wealth by the ex-Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2948"/>You come to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 24" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and you find a new <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 24" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, in the sense that her streets have lengthened, her buildings are more stately, and her bank accounts have grown larger; your sons are mining engineers, or chemists, or railroad kings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2949"/>And so with <placeName key="tgn,2308580" n="1.000 7" reg="east nashville, davidson, tennessee">Nashville</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,7014487" n="1.000 9" reg="savannah, chatham, georgia">Savannah</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>The old <rs>South</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 24" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> in a certain sense has passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>No longer do the men merely talk of crops or politics, but we are the same old South in the sense that we are the same men. It is not a new South in the idea that it is inhabited by a new race of men; no more is that true than that we are new men ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>Our sons, who will not own large plantations, but will manage great railroads and be masters of industrial occupations, will have liberty, and preserve its principles for their posterity as their fathers did. And today, if there were a necessity for it, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would step to the front, not under new men in the sense that they came from the <rs>North</rs> or are foreigners, but only new men in the sense that they came from our loins fitted for the day in which they were born.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>And this is what we have done in these <measure n="27years" type="date">twenty-seven years</measure>; we have preserved, in the form in which they were handed down to us, and as sacredly as our fathers ever did, the principles of constitutional liberty&mdash;principles not only of constitutional liberty, but principles which are a part of all constitutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>For liberty was before the constitution&mdash;it created the constitution and is its animating spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>We are not the creatures of the law, but its creators, and this we must always bear in mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/><pb id="p.236" n="236"/></p> 
<p>It has saved us that we believed in the sanctity of human nature, and built upon it as the corner-stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>No doubtful future can dismay the man who feels that he is going to do his best; no darkness of to-morrow can frighten him whose reliance is in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> as his father and in himself as his son.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2958"/>I sometimes hear that the <rs>South</rs> in these days is to express some sort of added patriotism&mdash;a greater amount of patriotism than any other part of the country; that we are under a sort of a cloud which requires us to give some additional bond of security for good behavior; that we are to be a little more extravagant in our utterances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2959"/>Standing in this old <name>Capitol</name>, whose very walls, redolent of the utterances of history, have an interest almost as great as the men whose statues adorn your squares, and in the presence of the great men who have gone before, I claim for the <rs>South</rs> that she has always been equal to her duty, and gives to every other section the equality she claims for herself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2960"/>And as I look through the <rs>South</rs> to-day, my heart is filled with an infinite joy. There was a time when it seemed that you could not complain if our young men left us; if they talked about the teeming fields of the <rs>Northwest</rs>; if they spoke of the wider opportunities of the <rs>Northeast</rs>; you could hardly put an obstacle in the way of your bright son, who wanted some broader field in which to labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2961"/>You yourself could not leave the graveyard and those who lay in it, the battlefield and those who fell on it; the memories of loved ones gone before tied you; but you could hardly say nay to your son who felt that the disasters of the war were permanent and the blight upon the land irremediable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2962"/>Who now wants to go to a wider field than this South.
