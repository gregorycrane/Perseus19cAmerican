<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Nearly <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> of execration ensued, until, in the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> generation, the earlier verdict was challenged, and the question at last asked: <q direct="unspecified">Shall <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00002.00008" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> have a statue?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and for long, the suggestion was looked upon almost as an impiety, and, as such, scornfully repelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Not only did the old loyal king-worship of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> recoil from the thought, but, indignantly appealing to the church, it declared that no such distinction could be granted so long as there remained in the prayer-book a form of supplication for <q direct="unspecified"><persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, the <name>Martyr</name>,</q> and of <q direct="unspecified">praise and thanksgiving for the wonderful deliverance of these kingdoms from the great rebellion, and all the other miseries and oppressions consequent thereon, under which they had so long groaned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>None the less, the demand was insistent, and at last, but only after <num value="2">two</num> full centuries had elapsed and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> was well advanced, was the verdict of <dateStruct value="1661--"><year reg="1661">1661</year></dateStruct> reversed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In this dramatic reversal of an accepted verdict&mdash;this complete revision of opinions once deemed settled and immutable&mdash;there is, I submit, a lesson&mdash;an academic lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The present occasion is essentially educational.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Phi Beta Kappa oration, as it is called, is the last, the crowning utterance of the college year, and very properly is expected to deal with some fitting theme in a kindred spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I propose to do so to-day, but in a fashion somewhat exceptional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The phases of moral and intellectual growth through which the <rs>English</rs> race has passed on the subject of <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00002.00011" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s statue afford, I submit, to the reflecting man an educational study of exceptional interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In the first place, it was a growth of <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure>; in the second place, it marks the passage of a nation from an existence under the traditions of feudalism to <num value="1">one</num> under the principles of self government; finally, it illustrates the gradual development of that broad spirit of tolerance which, coming with time and study, measures <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> the men and events of the past independently of the prejudices and passions which obscure and distort the immediate vision.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We, too, as well as the <rs>English</rs>, have had our <q direct="unspecified">Great Rebellion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It came to a dramatic close <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty-seven years</measure> since; as theirs came to a close not less dramatic some <num value="7">seven</num> time <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty-seven years</measure> since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We, also, as they in their time, formed our contemporaneous judgments and recorded our verdicts, assumed to be irreversible, of the men, the issues, and the events of the great conflict; and those verdicts and judgments, in our case as in theirs, will unquestionably be revised, modified, and in not a few cases wholly reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Better knowledge, calmer reflection, and a more judicial frame of mind come with the passage of the years; passions in time subside, prejudices disappear, truth asserts itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> this process has been going on for close upon <measure n="2.5centuries" type="date">two centuries and a half</measure>; with what result; <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00003.00012" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>'s statue stand as proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I propose on this occasion to do so; and reverting to my text&mdash; <q direct="unspecified">Shall <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00003.00015" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> have a Statue</q>&mdash;and reading that text in the gloss of <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00003.00016" reg="nearbymention:Carlyle,Thomas,,,"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Latter-Day Pamphlet</hi> utterance, I quote you <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>'s familiar precept, <quote rend="blockquote"><lg type="pentameter"> <l>Mutato nomine, de te</l> <l>Fabula narratur,</l></lg></quote> and ask abruptly, <q direct="unspecified">Shall <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0288.0002.00003.00017" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> have a statue?</q>

As <num value="1">one</num> thus formerly lined up against him, these questions I propose to discuss in the calmer and cooler, and altogether more reasonable light which comes to most men, when a whole generation of the human race lies buried between them and the issues and actors upon which they undertake to pass.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Was <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0288.0002.00004.00039" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> a traitor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Technically, I think he was indisputably a traitor to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; for a traitor, as I understand <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> it technically, is <num value="1">one</num> guilty of the crime of treason; or, as the <rs>Century Dictionary</rs> puts it, violating his allegiance to the chief authority of the <rs>State</rs>; while treason against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is specifically defined in the <rs>Constitution</rs> as <q direct="unspecified">levying war</q> against it, or <q direct="unspecified">adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>That <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00040" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> did levy war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can, I suppose, no more be denied than that he gave <q direct="unspecified">aid and comfort</q> to its enemies; and to the truth of this last proposition, I hold myself, among others, to be a very competent witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This technically; but in history, there is treason and treason, as there are traitors and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>And, furthermore, if <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00041" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was a traitor, so also, and indisputably were <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00042" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cromwell,,Oliver,,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00043" reg="default:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><foreName>Oliver</foreName> <surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hampden,,John,,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00044" reg="default:Hampden,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Hampden</surname></persName>, and <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> of <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The list might be extended indefinitely; but these will suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There can be no question that every <num value="1">one</num> of those named violated his allegiance, and gave aid and comfort to the enemies of his sovereign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 9" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> furnishes a precedent at every point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Except in their outcome, the cases were, therefore, precisely alike; and logic is logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It consequently appears to follow, that, if <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00050" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was a traitor, <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 9" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is unnecessary to institute similar comparisons with <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00051" reg="nearbymention:Cromwell,Oliver,,,"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hampden,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00005.00052" reg="nearbymention:Hampden,John,,,"><surname>Hampden</surname></persName> and <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> of <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>No defense can in their cases be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Technically, <num value="1">one</num> and all, they undeniably were traitors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But there are, as I have said, traitors and traitors&mdash;Catalines, Arnolds and G$o:;rgeis, as well as Cromwells, Hampdens and Washingtons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>To reach any satisfactory conclusion concerning a candidate for <q direct="unspecified">everlasting fame,</q>&mdash;whether to deify or damn&mdash;enroll him as savior, as martyr, or as criminal&mdash;it is, therefore, necessary still further to discriminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The cause, the motive, the conduct must be passed in review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Did turpitude anywhere attach to the original taking of sides, or to subsequent act?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Was the man a self-seeker?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Did low or sordid motives impel him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Did he seek to aggrandize himself at his country's cost?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Did he strike with a parricidal hand?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/></p> 
<p>These are grave questions; and, in the case of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00053" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, their consideration brings us at the threshold face to face with issues which have perplexed and divided the country since the day the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> became a country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They perplex and divide historians now. Legally, technically&mdash;the moral and humanitarian aspects of the issue wholly apart&mdash;which side had the best of the argument as to the rights and the wrongs of the case in the great debate which led up to the <rs>Civil War</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Before entering, however, on this well-worn&mdash;I might say, this threadbare&mdash;theme, as I find myself compelled in briefest way to do, there is <num value="1">one</num> preliminary very essential to be gone through with&mdash;a species of moral purgation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Bearing in mind <persName n="Johnson,Doctor,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00054" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Bradley,T.,,:5"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s advice to <persName n="Boswell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00055" reg="mostcommon:Boswell,nomatch:0"><surname>Boswell</surname></persName>, on a certain memorable occasion, we should at least try to clear our minds of cant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Many years ago, but only shortly before his death, <persName n="Cobden,,Richard,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00056" reg="default:Cobden,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Cobden</surname></persName> said in <num value="1">one</num> of his truth-telling deliverances to his <placeName reg="Rochdale, Rochdale, England" key="tgn,7010541">Rochdale</placeName> constituents&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">I really believe I might be Prime Minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>If I would get up and say you are the greatest, the wisest, the best, the happiest people in the world, and keep on repeating that, I don't doubt but what I might be Prime Minister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I have seen Prime Minister's made in my experience precisely by that process.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The same great apostle of homely sense, on another occasion bluntly remarked in a similar spirit to the <rs type="place">House of Commons</rs>&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">We generally sympathise with everybody's rebels but our own.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>In both these respects I submit we <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00057" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> are true descendants from the <name>Anglo</name>-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00058" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> stock; and nowhere is this more unpleasantly apparent than in any discussion which may arise of the motives which actuated those of our countrymen who did not at the time see the issues involved in our Civil War as we saw them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Like those whom <persName n="Cobden,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00059" reg="nearbymention:Cobden,Richard,,,"><surname>Cobden</surname></persName> addressed, we like to glorify our ancestors and ourselves, and we do not particularly care to give ear to what we are pleased to term unpatriotic, and, at times, even treasonable talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>In other words, and in plain, unpalatable <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00060" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, our minds are saturated with cant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Only in the case of others do we see things as they really are. Ceasing to be individually interested, we then at once become nothing unless critical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>So, when it comes to rebellions, we, like <persName n="Cobden,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00006.00061" reg="nearbymention:Cobden,Richard,,,"><surname>Cobden</surname></persName>'s Englishmen, are wont almost invariably to sympathize with everybody's rebels but our own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Our souls spontaneously go forth to Celt, Pole, Hungarian, Boer, and Hindoo; but, when we are concerned, language quite fails us in which adequately to depict the moral turpitude which must actuate Confederate or Filipino who rises in resistance against what we are <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> pleased really to consider, as well as call, the best and most beneficent government the world has yet been permitted to see&mdash;our government!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>This, I submit, is cant, pure cant, and at the threshold of discussion we had best free our minds of it, wholly, if we can; if not wholly, then in so far as we can. Philip the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, when he directed his crusade in the name of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, Church, and Government, against <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> of <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName>, indulged in it in quite as good faith as we, and as for <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Martyr</name></q> and the <q direct="unspecified">sainted</q> <persName n="Laud,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00007.00062" reg="mostcommon:Laud,nomatch:0"><surname>Laud</surname></persName>, for <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> after <placeName reg="Cromwell's head">Cromwell's head</placeName> was stuck on a pole, all <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> annually lamented in sackcloth and ashes the wrongs inflicted by sacrilegious hands on those most assuredly well-meaning rulers and men. All depends on the point of view, and, during our own Civil War, while we unceasingly denounced the wilful wickedness of those who bore parricidal arms against the <num value="1">one</num> immaculate authority yet given the eye of man to look upon, the leading newspaper of the world was referring to us in perfect good faith <q direct="unspecified">as an insensate and degenerate people.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>An <name>English</name> member of Parliament, speaking at the same time in equally good faith, declared that throughout the length and breadth of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, public sentiment was almost unanimously on the side of <q direct="unspecified">the southerners,</q> as ours was on the side of the <name>Boers</name>, because our <q direct="unspecified">rebels</q> were <q direct="unspecified">fighting against <num value="1">one</num> of the most grinding, <num value="1">one</num> of the most galling, <num value="1">one</num> of the most irritating attempts to establish tyrranical government that ever disgraced the history of the world.</q>

<p>Upon the correctness or otherwise of these judgments I do not care to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They certainly cannot be reconciled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The single point I make is that they were, when made, the expression of views honestly and sincerely entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>We sympathize with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>'s rebels; <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> sympathized with our rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Our rebels in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, as theirs in <dateStruct value="1900--"><year reg="1900">1900</year></dateStruct>, thoroughly believed they were resisting an iniquitous attempt to deprive them of their rights, and to establish over them a <q direct="unspecified">grinding,</q> a <q direct="unspecified">galling,</q> and an <q direct="unspecified">irritating</q> <q direct="unspecified">tyrannical government.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>We in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1898--"><year reg="1898">1898</year></dateStruct>, and <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> <q direct="unspecified">the <name>Martyr</name></q> and <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> some centuries earlier, were fully convinced that we were engaged in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> work while we trod under foot the <q direct="unspecified">rebel</q> and the <q direct="unspecified">traitor.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Presently, as distance lends a more correct perspective, and things are viewed in their true proportions, we will get perhaps to realize that our case furnishes no exception to the general rule, and that we, too, like the <rs>English</rs> <q direct="unspecified">generally sympathize with everybody's rebels but our own.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Justice may then be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/><pb id="p.8" n="8"/></p> 
<p>Having entered this necessary, if somewhat hopeless <hi rend="italics">caveat</hi>, let us address ourselves to the question at issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I will state it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Legally and technically, not morally, again let me say, and wholly irrespective of humanitarian considerations, to which side did the weight of argument incline during the great debate which culminated in our Civil War?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The answer necessarily turns on the abstract right of what we term a sovereign State to secede from the <rs>Union</rs> at such time and for such cause as may seem to that State proper and sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The issue is settled now; irrevocably and for all time decided; it was not settled <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago, and the settlement since reached has been the result, not of reason based on historical evidence, but of events and of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>To pass a fair judgment on the line of conduct pursued by <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00008.00063" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, it is necessary to go back in thought and imagination, and see things, not as they now are, but as they then were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>If we do so, and accept the judgment of some of the more modern students and investigators of history, either wholly unprejudiced or with a distinct Union bias, it would seem as if the weight of argument falls into what I will term the <rs>Confederate</rs> scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>That in certain well-remembered instances this course was not pursued, is to my mind, even yet much to be deplored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>In such cases clemency is only another form of cant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Having now discussed what have seemed to me the necessary preliminaries, I come to the particular cases of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0288.0002.00015.00102" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>As respects <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, moreover, I am fain to say there was in the attitude of the <rs>State</rs> toward the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and, indeed, in its bearing throughout the <rs>Civil War</rs>, something which appealed strongly &mdash;something unselfish and chivalric&mdash;worthy of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s highest record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>History will, I think, do justice to it. <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, it must be remembered, while a slave State, was not a cotton State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>This was a distinction implying a difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> existed, and because of it she was in close sympathy with her sister slave States; but, while in the cotton States slavery had gradually assumed a purely material form, in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> it still retained much of its patriarchal character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>This fact had a direct bearing on the moral issue; for slavery, <num value="1">one</num> thing in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, was quite another in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The Virginian pride was, moreover, proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Indeed, I doubt if local feeling and patriotism and devotion to the <rs>State</rs> ever anywhere attained a fuller development than in the community which dwelt in the region watered by the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the <rs>James</rs>, of which <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was the political center.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>I wanted to be by myself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Nor did we overestimate the importance of the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>If it did not in the end mean reaction, it did mean time gained; and time then, as the result showed, was vital.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Thus, be it always remembered, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> did not take its place in the secession movement because of the election of an anti-slavery president.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It did not raise its hand against the national government from mere love of any peculiar institution, or a wish to protect and to perpetuate it. It refused to be precipitated into a civil convulsion; and its refusal was of vital moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The ground of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s final action was of wholly another nature, and of a nature far more creditable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, as I have said, made State sovereignty an article&mdash;a cardinal article&mdash;of its political creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>So, logically and consistently, it took the position that, though it might be unwise for a State to secede, a State which did secede could not, and should not be coerced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>To us now this position seems worse than illogical; it is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>So events proved it then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Yet, after all, it is based on the great fundamental principle of the consent of the governed; and, in the days immediately preceding the war, something very like it was accepted as an article of correct political faith by men afterward as strenuous in support of a Union re-established by force, as <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0288.0002.00018.00117" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0288.0002.00018.00118" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n0288.0002.00018.00119" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <persName n="Chase,,Salmon,P.,," id="n0288.0002.00018.00120" reg="default:Chase,Salmon,P.,,"><foreName>Salmon</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0288.0002.00018.00121" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The difference was that, confronted by the overwhelming tide of events, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> adhered to it; they, in presence of that tide, tacitly abandoned it. In my judgment, they were right: But <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 24" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, though mistaken more consistent, judged otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>As I have said, in shaping a practicable outcome of human affairs logic is often as irreconcilable with the dictates of worldly wisdom as are metaphysics with common sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>So now the issue shifted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>It became a question, not of slavery or of the wisdom, or even the expediency, of secession, but of the right of the national government to coerce a sovereign State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>This at the <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> time was well understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The extremists of the <rs>South</rs>, counting upon it, counted with absolute confidence; and openly proclaimed their reliance in debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>And here, in preparing this address, I must fairly acknowledge having encountered an obstacle in my path also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The question gave me pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>And then I must confess to a sense of the humor of the situation coming over me, as I found it answered to my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The case had already arisen; the answer had been given; nor had it been given in any uncertain tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/><num value="1">One</num> of my name, from whom I claim descent, was in those years prominent in public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>I believe it to be typical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>A few months ago I received a letter from a retired army officer of high character from which I extract the following: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00029.00220" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was essentially a Virginian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>But, after the surrender, he stood firmly and unreservedly in favor of loyalty to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>A gentleman told me this anecdote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The kindly paternal advice thus given was, I imagine, typical of his whole <hi rend="italics">post bellum</hi> life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>Let this <num value="1">one</num> anecdote suffice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Here was magnanimity, philosophy, true patriotism, the pure American spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Talk of tratiors and of treason!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>The man who pursued that course and instilled that spirit had not, could not have had, in his whole being <num value="1">one</num> drop of traitor's blood or conceived a treacherous thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>His lights may have been wrong&mdash;according to our ideas then and now they were wrong&mdash;but they were his lights, and in acting in full accordance with them he was right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/></p> 
<p>Even tolerance may be carried too far, and is apt then to verge dangerously on what may be better described as moral indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>It is by the recognition and acceptance of these the men prominent in history must be measured, and approved or condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>To call it our Civil War is but a mere euphemistic way of referring to what was in fact a slave-holders' rebellion, conceived and put in action for no end but to perpetuate and extend a system of human servitude, a system the relic of barbarism, an insult to advancing humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>To this I would reply, that we, who take another view, neither confound, nor seek to confound, right with wrong, or treason with loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>We accept the verdict of time; but, in so doing, we insist that the verdict shall be in accordance with the facts, and that each individual shall be judged on his own merits, and not stand acquitted or condemned in block.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>In this respect time works wonders, leaving few conclusions wholly unchallenged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Take, for instance, <num value="1">one</num> of the final contentions of <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0288.0002.00030.00229" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, that, following old world <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> precedents, founded, as he claimed, in reason and patriotism, the names of battles of the war of the rebellion should be removed from the regimental colors of the national army, and from the army register.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>He put it on the ground that, from the republics of antiquity down to our days, no civilized nation ever thought it wise or patriotic to preserve in conspicuous and durable form the mementoes of victories won over fellow-citizens in civil war. As the sympathizing orator said at the time of <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00031.00230" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s death&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Should the son of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, when at some future day defending the <rs>Republic</rs> against some foreign foe, be reminded by an inscription on the colors floating over him, that under this flag the gun was fired that killed his father at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>This assuredly has a plausible sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/><q direct="unspecified">His father;</q> yes, perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>Though even in the immediately succeeding generation something might well be said on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>Presumably, in such case, the father was a brave, an honest and a loyal man&mdash;contending for what he believed to be right&mdash;for it, laying down his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/><placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> is a name and a memory of which none there need ever feel ashamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>As in most battles, there was a victor and a vanquished; but on that day the vanquished, as well as the victor, fought a stout fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>If, in all recorded warfare there is a deed of arms the name and memory of which the descendants of those who participated therein should not wish to see obliterated from any record, be it historian's page or battle-flag, it was the advance of <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00031.00231" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,George,E.,,:2"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s Virginian division across that wide valley of death in front of <placeName reg="Cemetery Ridge, Wallowa, Oregon" key="tgn,2230296">Cemetery Ridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>I know in all recorded warfare of no finer, no more sustained and deadly feat of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>I have stood on either battlefield, and, in scope and detail, carefully compared the <num value="2">two</num>; and, challenging denial, I affirm that the much vaunted charge of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s guard at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName>, in fortitude, discipline and deadly energy will not bear comparison with that other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>It was boy's work beside it. There, brave men did all that the bravest men could do. Why then should the son of <num value="1">one</num> of those who fell coming up the long ascent, or over our works and in among our guns, feel a sense of wrong because <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName></q> is inscribed on the flag of the battery a gun of which he now may serve?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>On the contrary, I should suppose he would there see that name only.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>But, supposing it otherwise in the case of the son&mdash;the wound being in such case yet fresh and green&mdash;how would it be when a sufficient time has elapsed to afford the needed perspective?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Let us suppose a grandson <num value="6">six</num> generations removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>What Englishman, be he Cavalier or Roundhead by descent&mdash;did his ancestor charge <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> with <persName><foreName>Rupert</foreName></persName> or <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00032.00232" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,Oliver,,,:4"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>&mdash;did he fall while riding with leveled point in the grim wall of advancing Ironsides, or go hopelessly down in death beneath their thundering hoofs&mdash;what descendant of any Englishman who there met his end, but with pride would read the name of <placeName reg="Naseby, Northamptonshire, England" key="tgn,7010905">Naseby</placeName> on his regimental flag?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>What Frenchman would consent to the erasure of Ivry or Moncontour?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Thus, in all these matters, time is the great magician.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>It both mellows and transforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>The <rs>Englishman</rs> of to-day does not apply to <persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00032.00233" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,Oliver,,,:4"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName> the standard of loyalty or treason, of right and wrong, applied after the <name>Restoration</name>; nor again, does the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> century confirm the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num>'s verdicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Even slavery we may come to regard as a phase, pardonable as passing, in the evolution of a race.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>I hold it will certainly be so with our Civil War.

They&mdash;for we by that time will have rejoined the generation to which we belonged&mdash;will recognize the somewhat essential fact, indubitably true, that all the honest conviction, all the loyalty, all the patriotic devotion and self-sacrifice were not then, any more than all the courage, on the victor's side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>True! the moral right, the spirit of nationality, the sacred cause of humanity even, were on our side, but among those opposed, and who in the end went down, were men not less sincere, not less devoted, not less truly patriotic according to their lights, than he who among us was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in all those qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Men of whom it was and is a cause of pride and confidence to say: <q direct="unspecified">They, too, were countrymen!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>As I have more than once said, he was a Virginian of the <name>Virginians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>They have in them all the elements of the heroic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>As <persName n="Carlyle,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00032.00235" reg="mostcommon:Carlyle,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Carlyle</surname></persName> wrote more than half a century ago, so now: <q direct="unspecified">Whom do you wish <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> to resemble?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/></p> 
<p>It is all a question of time; and the time is, probably, not quite yet. The wounds of the great war are not altogether healed, its personal memories are still fresh, its passions not wholly allayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It would, indeed, be cause for special wonder if they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>But, I am as convinced as an unillumined man can be of anything future, that when such time does come, a justice, not done now, will be done to those descendants of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00033.00236" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00033.00237" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Thomas,,,:1"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Rutledge,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00033.00238" reg="nearbymention:Rutledge,Arthur,M.,,"><surname>Rutledge</surname></persName>, and of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0288.0002.00033.00239" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who stood opposed to us in a succeeding generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>That the national spirit is now supreme and the nation cemented, I hold to be unquestionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>That property in man has vanished from the civilized world is due to our Civil War. The <num value="2">two</num> are worth the great price then paid for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>But, wrong as he may have been, and as he was proved by events, in these respects the <rs>Confederate</rs> had many great and generous qualities; he also was brave, chivalrous, self-sacrificing, sincere, and patriotic.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2369"/>The negro slave was a highly valuable member of the body politic; a tiller of the soil whose services could be counted on when the crop was pitched, and a laborer who furnished to all his fellows, young and old, sick and well, a more liberal supply of the necessaries of life than was ever granted to any other laboring class in any other place or any other age. And in what the <name>Economists</name> call the distribution of the wealth that was produced by the negro's labor and the skill of the master who guided and restrained him, the share the master took was small indeed compared with what the <rs>Captains</rs> of Industry took in the free society of the same day. Compared with the share those captains take now, the modest share taken by the masters was what the magnates of to-day would scorn to consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2393"/>A very elaborate exposition of the need for technical education of the people in place of the kind that has been till now given was published some years since as a report of the <orgName n="Education Department" type="department">Department of Education</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 9" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> with all the authentication that the <rs>Government</rs> could give it, and its recommendations have been largely adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2397"/>There was good reason why it should be so. Every boy and every girl was set to such work as each was best fitted for and taught to do it well; for the teaching was not done by a salaried official with the inefficiency so familiar to us all, but by a person strongly prompted by interest to make the teaching successful and having power to enforce exertion in the pupil, while he or she was at the same time strongly restrained by self-interest from impairing the health of the pupil by work at too early an age, or too hard work or too dangerous work at any age.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>The quiet which ensued the fall of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> afforded the <rs>Governor</rs> a good pretext, and so on the <dateStruct value="-12-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> the company was mustered out of service and the students ordered to prepare themselves to return to College on the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>The action of the <rs>Governor</rs> at this time in disbanding the company defeated the hopes which the students had entertained of going to the front in a body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>In fact, the faculty of the <rs type="place">College</rs>, as well as State officials, deemed it inexpedient that they should do so, fearing that the ardor of youth would prove rather a disadvantage, and preferred that the students should go as individuals and be incorporated in commands under older heads.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2984"/>A longitudinal strip <measure n="12inches" type="distance">12 inches</measure> wide was riveted the full length on top.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3236"/>Remember, this was but for an instant, <pb id="p.181" n="181"/> and when the leader thought he was entirely unobserved.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3238"/>An hour passed by and the battle had not been revived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3239"/>The troops, wearied of standing, in expectant phalanx, reclined on the ground, but where they could regain their places at a single bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3240"/><time value="8oclock">Eight o'clock</time> came, and the sun had lifted the fog and sent a grateful warmth to the long, shivering lines of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3241"/>A few shots on the skirmish line betrayed the fact that both armies were ready, and, apparently, each waiting for the other to open the initial fire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3242"/><time value="9oclock">Nine o'clock</time>, and even the pickets were quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>I rode over toward the left, and hearing no firing, I turned my horse's head directly toward the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>Here was <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Brannan,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00181.02015" reg="mostcommon:Brannan,nomatch:0"><surname>Brannan</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName>, with its regiments retired <num value="1">one</num> after another as a sort of reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>My heart sank again as I looked upon the slender regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle for that division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> commanded by <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00181.02016" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,Henry,,:5"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> of its regiments distinguished themselves at <placeName reg="Mill Springs, Wayne, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040311">Mill Springs</placeName>, but after that they missed the great battles of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> and <placeName reg="Stones River, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2696868">Stone River</placeName>. <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> they mustered nearly <num value="8000">8,000</num> bayonets&mdash;nearly double the average strength of the division.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>The next day there were few regiments that numbered <num value="200">200</num> men. The day before it was almost a pistol shot from the colors to the flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>Now a child could have easily spanned the distance with a pebble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>Thrice had they driven the enemy, and thrice had they been driven, and the slight&mdash;slight lines called a regiment&mdash;attested that they were veterans, though fighting their virgin battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>There was the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH11">Eleventh Ohio</orgName>, scarcely numbering <num value="2">two</num> small companies, coolly waiting for the shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>Beside was an Indiana regiment, a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> younger in the service, but, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>as stinted of men as its battle-battered companion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>Moving forward to our foremost line of battle, I struck upon <orgName n="division"><persName n="Palmer,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00181.02017" reg="mostcommon:Palmer,Wm,,,:1"><surname>Palmer</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> holding a slight hill, on the crest of which they had erected a little palisade of logs and rails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>Over this a dozen cannon were peering, and the men stood in lengthened groups listening to the straggling skirmish fire which had again broken out. The <orgName type="regiment" key="KY2">Second Kentucky</orgName> was there, and while I was shaking hands with old friends the firing in front swelled up, until the crack of a <num value="100">hundred</num> rifles startled the air. The soldiers sprang to their palisade without a word, and rested their guns calmly across it. Old soldiers and true soldiers, they needed no command to warn them to their post.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>Returning to the rear, I passed many of the dead of both armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/><pb id="p.182" n="182"/> Here I stopped my horse to gaze on the sweet face of a mere boy, in rebel uniform, who had been shot through the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>I never saw a lovelier smile than that which death had imprinted on his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>His eyes, moist and blue as in life, were wide open, and expressed an excited state, if ever I saw it in human face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3260"/>His lips were parted by a winning smile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3261"/>I have seen pleasure on the faces of the slain before, but never anything that was so unequivocally happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3262"/>The dead boy could not have been more than <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3263"/>He was enveloped rather than dressed in a loose gray uniform, as neatly kept as it was clumsy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3264"/>His loose stockings had fallen around his worn shoes, revealing a white and slender leg. What mother was robbed of her tender child when this poor boy fell?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3265"/>Not far off reclined a German Federal artilleryman, with a patriarchal beard and a face as composed in death as if modeled after <persName n="Socrates,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00182.02018" reg="mostcommon:Socrates,nomatch:0"><surname>Socrates</surname></persName>' own. He had bled to death from a wound in the neck, and his features wore the placid look of all who die from that cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3266"/><num value="1">One</num> arm was thrown under his head; the other lay loosely by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3267"/>His fingers had almost clasped a delicate mimosa that ran near, but its fragile leaves had opened with the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3268"/>An infant's breath would shut up its tender foliage&mdash;it would almost shrink together from the touch of the wild bee's foot&mdash;but its stem twined between the dead soldier's fingers, with leaves as open and blooming as if it loved the cold carcass.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3269"/>Turning again to the rear, I passed into a hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3270"/>Here I found a number of the <name>Woodward</name> boys, <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first companies</orgName> to leave <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3271"/>It had taken <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> men into <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>'s fight; of that <num value="2">number two</num> were killed and <measure n="11" type="wounded">eleven wounded</measure>. There was little <persName n="Beck,,Jesse,De,," id="n0288.0020.00182.02019" reg="default:Beck,Jesse,De,,"><foreName>Jesse</foreName> <foreName>De</foreName> <surname>Beck</surname></persName>, who once discharged from service as a minor against his will, ran off from home with his company, went to <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> and re-enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3272"/>He lay shot in <num value="3">three</num> places&mdash;leg, right arm, and a hideous wound through the mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3273"/>He extended his left hand to me, with an apology for not giving me his shattered right&mdash;the little hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3274"/><q direct="unspecified">I am nearly shot to pieces, ain't I,</q> he said, as well as he could utter the words through his torn palate and jaw, but not a word of complaint, not a sigh of pain or discomfort would he utter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3275"/>Sorrowfully I turned from the place, and next found myself where <persName n="Cleve,,,,,Van" id="n0288.0020.00182.02020" reg="mostcommon:Cleve,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Cleve</surname></persName> was stationed as a reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>Here was <persName n="Beatty,,Sam,,," id="n0288.0020.00182.02021" reg="default:Beatty,Sam,,,"><foreName>Sam</foreName> <surname>Beatty</surname></persName> with what he brought out of his brilliant charge of the day before; <num value="390">390</num> men were all that were left of the <num value="1400">1,400</num>&mdash;our regiments in all averaging less than <num value="100">100</num> men each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>These figures I took from his <pb id="p.183" n="183"/> morning report, and if I felt alarmed at the smallness of the battalions before, the infallible logic of figures did not reassure me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/><num value="0.25">A quarter</num> to <num value="10">10</num> I rode over to a cornfield in the rear of the lines and threw a few ears of corn to my horse&mdash;a lean, stubborn colt&mdash;stubborn to lack of bridle knowledge rather than any inherent vice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>A funny animal was that colt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>Indeed, army correspondents seem to get an eccentric beast through some fatality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>My colt had a very confident way of selecting a tree at any stage of a journey, and siding up to it to be tied, and it required all the pointed eloquence of my heels to stir him. But he was green rather than vicious, for he would take my companion's clucks as soon as my own, and increase his gait accordingly.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>While he was munching his corn a sharp scrimmage broke out on the left; a battery followed with <num value="4">four</num> rapid discharges, the musket fire rekindled, and in a moment there was a crash&mdash;a heavy volley of musketry, such a <num value="1">one</num> as no line of skirmishers ever fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>I say by my watch that it lacked <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> of <num value="10">ten</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>The enemy opened a battery, and a grapeshot, wide of its destination, struck within a few feet of me and glanced off up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>I tried a knob further along, but an occasional minie whistled by vehemently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/>It seemed as if there was no place within sight of the battle-field that was absolutely safe.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>The thunder of battle deepened, and for an hour there was no pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3288"/>The musketry was furious, drowning the thunderous throbbing of <num value="6">a half dozen</num> of our batteries in fierce action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3289"/>For <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> I could see the gray-blue smoke arise from the trees, tufted here and there by whirling spheres of vapor, as they vomited from the hot and cavernous artillery.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3290"/>There came a rife of stragglers to the rear&mdash;negroes leading officers' horses, wounded men, and some, I thought, only feigning to be wounded; they drifted slowly up the hill where I stood, their pace accelerated occasionally by the chance vagrant minies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>These are the legitimate refuse of the fight, I thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3292"/>Every battle is the same thing&mdash;and I was thankful that there were no more of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3293"/>The stream stopped, and the battle grew more and more noisily terrible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3294"/>Suddenly, a frightful cheer broke out along our entire left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3295"/>Not a round, manly cheer&mdash;not a Federal cheer&mdash;but a frantic prolonged yell, pitched almost to a childish treble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3296"/>It grew plainer and plainer, and I felt that the enemy was making the grand charge, for which he had been gathering himself during the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3297"/>I could see <pb id="p.184" n="184"/> the smoke from the fresh batteries arise; and I could tell that every musket in more than half our army was unflinchingly belching death's flame into the very faces of the surging foe. How anxiously I watched those forests from which if overpowered, our forces must issue in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, not a man came out. The wild cheer often vieing with the clangor of battle for <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>&mdash;an eternity it seemed to my ears&mdash;dwindled away, then gushed out again, but further off. At last it died out slowly, prolonged shrilly toward the end, as if some <persName n="Winkelried,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00184.02022" reg="mostcommon:Winkelried,nomatch:0"><surname>Winkelried</surname></persName> refused to follow his flying comrades, and was defying death in the shower of iron that seemed to rip and shiver every atom of space save where he was standing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>The terrific charge on the left had failed, but the thunder did not slacken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>There were times when the elastic air and the impassive earth seemed to throb with the pulse of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>At <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> the firing extended toward the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>We opened fresh batteries, and all, save <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00184.02023" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00184.02024" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Philip,,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, were fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>The terrific fury of the firing at this time cannot be described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>It brought the hearts of those who were listening, in the rear, to their mouths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>A dozen awful claps of thunder at the same instant might have been heard above the din of that fearful noon, but it could hardly have sensibly increased the crushing volume of sound.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>They had repulsed the great charge of the day, but at heavy cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>The enemy had plenty of reserve, and massed them again on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>He pushed his lines forward, and the weakness of our brave right was beginning to show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>At the end of <num value="1">one</num> short hour <persName n="Cleve,,,,,Van" id="n0288.0020.00184.02031" reg="mostcommon:Cleve,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Cleve</surname></persName> was no longer in reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>He was fighting with <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00184.02032" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,George,Henry,,:5"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, for the left&mdash;that terrible, gluttonous left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>He pushed forward and faced to the front, and his men at last returned shot for shot.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>At <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time> the roar of battle had not abated in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>Another stream of stragglers break to rear, heavier than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>Again I tried to convince myself that this is all legitimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>Men with guns pour out, and I cannot see that they are hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/><num value="4">Four</num> caissons trot out briskly and take up the hill obliquely, hurriedly, it is true, but not panic-stricken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>I gallop over and ask the name of the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/></p> 
<p>Once more the stream abated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> men, perhaps, had <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> left the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/><q direct="unspecified">A brigade whipped, only,</q> I argued; <q direct="unspecified">no occasion for an alarm.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>The firing sounded nearer, but not much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/><time value="2oclock">Two o'clock</time> came and it had neared alarmingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>Shortly after, for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time, the stragglers issued from the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/>Now they come in great waves, some taking the nearest road toward <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, many crossing the hills to strike other roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>A colonel rode out, followed by <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> men, and took his way down the road leisurely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>The streams poured out disorganized, but not aprently alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>A moment more, and they seemed to issue by brigades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>Great <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>The caissons of <num value="2">two</num> more entire batteries were mingling with the retreating army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>Down the road the mass pushed, horses and men filling it, and struggling through the open forests on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3335"/>I looked back, and still great waves of men came out, defeated and disorganized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3336"/>There was no panic and but little visible hurry in this broken mass of men. As the line pushed on toward <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> the trains that had been parked along the roadside at different points poured into the throng and took the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3337"/>Not another <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, after all, I thought, for even the teamsters are collected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3338"/>For an instant, however, there was a panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3339"/>A shrill shout came up from behind and the stragglers scattered from the road, thinking that the enemy's cavalry was upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3340"/>The next moment their alarm was quieted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3341"/>A deer which had been hunted from its fastness by these <num value="2">two</num> great searching armies, bounded down the road and darting through the disconcerted teams, dashed up the hill, while a <num value="1000">thousand</num> contiguous stragglers clutched vainly at his fleet limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3342"/>The rout again became leisurely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3343"/>I learned that after the withdrawal of <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00185.02035" reg="mostcommon:Wood,John,Taylor,,:4"><surname>Wood</surname></persName> from the center, <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00185.02036" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00185.02037" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Philip,,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> were necessarily called upon to fill the gap. <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0288.0020.00185.02038" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> moved rapidly to the left, but after getting his position he could not alone breast the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3474"/>If generals in supreme command are so thin-skinned that to suppress a sarcasm or a gibe they are content to perpetuate an outrage to which the history of modern warfare can present no parallel, it is likely enough that they may wince at the outspoken language in which <name>English</name> politicians and <name>English</name> journalists record their judgment against deeds of infamy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6826"/>From what he has told me of the matter, I imagine that it was the greatest sensation that ever broke the calm of old <placeName key="tgn,2023617" n="1.000 65" reg="milledgeville, baldwin, georgia">Milledgeville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>The owners of the vessel were highly connected with the best families of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and many of their relatives were residents of the old State capital.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6829"/>What made matters worse, the owners of the <hi rend="italics">Wanderer</hi> selected this plantation as a base from which to distribute their human cargo about among other plantations of the sea-coast region, and what we call the <quote>wire-grass section </quote> of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6830"/>The matter was discussed <pb id="p.359" n="359"/> at length in the <orgName n="Georgia Senate" type="senate">Georgia Senate</orgName> and <persName n="House,,,,," id="n0288.0039.00359.05294" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>, opinions being divided in the matter, some regarding the enterprise with disfavor and others taking the view that in arresting the owners and seizing the cargo the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was overriding States rights roughshod.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/> But the most interesting phase of this matter was a thing that happened years after the <name>Civil</name> war, at a time when the people of this country had forgotten all about the <hi rend="italics">Wanderer</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6833"/>The <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6834"/>He had his hands full to accomplish that much even, for the owners had scattered them about over the country so thoroughly before they were found out that, between conflicting interests, duplicity, and falsehood, it is a wonder that he got together as many as he did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6946"/></p> 
<p>It says the people of this generation know that the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers were inferior in numbers, but they likewise know that our armies repeatedly gained victories over greater forces and that our generals were more than equal in skill to those of the enemy's. Then the <hi rend="italics">Picayune</hi> proceeds to give a thoughtful answer to the question propounded, presenting some views that have not occurred to all writers on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6947"/>We quote:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6948"/>The army rolls show that from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the last the forces on the <rs>Northern</rs> side were <num value="2000000">two million</num>, <num value="860000">eight hundred and sixty thousand</num> men, while on the <rs>Southern</rs> there were about <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men, making an odds of more than <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> on the side of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6949"/>But this enormous disparity of numbers did not appall the leaders and soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, because they had astablished a reputation for tremendous and successful fighting that filled them with confidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6950"/>If disproportion in numbers had been all, there are many reasons to hope, if not to believe with confidence, that the result would have been different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6951"/>But the most serious features of the situation against the <rs>South</rs> and in favor of the <rs>North</rs> were in the fact that the <rs>Northern Government</rs> possessed all the military establishments, arms and <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> supplies that belonged to the army, and all the ships and the entire armament and equipment of the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6952"/>If there had been a fair division of these resources between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, the <rs>South</rs> would not have been totally destitute of them in the beginning, and would not have suffered grievously for the most necessary military munitions, equipments, and supplies.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6953"/>It then became necessary to create from the very beginning establishments not only for the manufacture of arms, ammunition, equipments, war vessels and everything required for military operations, but it was also absolutely requisite to manufacture for all the needs of daily life the ordinary articles of common use that had been cut off from the <rs>Southern</rs> people by the naval blockade instituted by the <rs>Northern Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6954"/>Unfortunately, the <rs>Southern</rs> people had devoted themselves to the production of raw material and were therefore dependent on Northern States of the <rs>Union</rs> and on foreign countries for the simplest articles of daily use.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6956"/>A war cannot long be successfully carried on without money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6957"/>It is required for the purchase of material and supplies, and for the wages of the soldiers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6958"/>The men who have left their wives and children behind while they are standing in the forefront of battle must be able to send home for the support of their dear ones the money they earn in the public defence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6959"/>The plans of the <rs>Southern</rs> financiers were based on sound principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6960"/>In the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of the war the <rs>South</rs> produced <measure n="20000000barrels" type="mass">20,000,000 bales</measure> of cotton worth <measure n="600000000dollars" type="currency">$600,000,000</measure>, and many <measure n="1000000l." type="pounds"><num value="1000000">million</num> pounds</measure> of tobacco, worth also a great deal of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6961"/>It was proposed that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> should purchase these products with bonds, and then ship them to the great <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> markets, where they would meet with the ready sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6962"/>This scheme, however, was defeated by the <rs>Federal</rs> blockade of Southern ports, which was begun in the summer of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6963"/>A belief was cherished in the <rs>South</rs> that the great manufacturing <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nations would break the blockade in order to get cotton for their people to spin and wear, but this expectation proved wholly abortive, and the <rs>Southern Government</rs> was forced to imitate their adversaries in the <rs>North</rs> by issuing paper money.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6964"/>The value of this paper currency held up very well in the beginning, but it rapidly lost the confidence of the people, and this fact, more than anything else, hurt the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6965"/>It is true that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> negotiated considerable loans in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but the money was kept there to pay for warships built and equipped in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6966"/>From this brief statement of <pb id="p.370" n="370"/> facts it is seen that the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause was placed at a disadvantage for the lack of material supplies which were necessary for the conduct of the war and the comfort of the people that was vastly more serious than was the disparity in numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6967"/>Then there was a great disadvantage of geographical position and condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6968"/>The entire Southern section was divided from north to south by a great navigable river, the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6969"/>This enabled the <rs>Federal</rs> naval fleets to cut the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in <num value="2">two</num>, and divorce its western from its eastern section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6970"/>Its northern boundary was made by the <placeName reg="Ohio River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014265">Ohio</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2257292" n="1.000 2" reg="cornfield point, saint marys, maryland">Potomac rivers</placeName>, navigable for boats and largely used by war vessels and military transports.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6972"/>But so far as the fighting was concerned, it all went well in that part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> east of the <rs type="place">Alleghany mountain</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6973"/>Army after army, each time under a new commander, was dispatched by the authorities for the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital had been set up, and each of those armies in turn had been hurled back, broken, defeated and dreadfully punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6976"/>When the people saw <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0288.0041.00370.05340" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0288.0041.00370.05341" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thomas,J.,,:6"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> leaving them for a southward march, they had full confidence that the troops would return as they always did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6977"/>Some of the most noted commanders in the <rs>West</rs> retreated, never to revisit the positions which they had abandoned, and the people came to understand that this abandonment was final.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6978"/>This constant retreating was not always necessitated by attacks and defeat at the hands of a superior force of the enemy, but was in obedience to a fixed plan of strategy named from the <rs>Roman</rs> general, <persName n="Maximus,,Fabius,,," id="n0288.0041.00370.05342" reg="default:Maximus,Fabius,,,"><foreName>Fabius</foreName> <surname>Maximus</surname></persName>, who in his campaigns against <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n0288.0041.00370.05343" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> made it a rule to avoid battle and always to retreat.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6980"/>Whether the great Federal armies could have been worn out and <pb id="p.371" n="371"/> eventually ruined by a systematic course of retreat and evasion on the part of the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> does not appear, as it was not carried out to a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6981"/>They saw their homes given up to the possession of the enemy, with no hope that the country would ever be recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6982"/>If the <rs>South</rs> had been abundantly supplied with all the necessaries for both peace and war, possibly the strategy of retreat might have been good policy, but in view of the destitute condition of the <rs>South</rs>, it would appear that the very greatest and most aggressive activity was necessary to meet the great superiority of force and material.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6983"/>The object here is not to criticise commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6984"/>There has never been a great soldier who was not a great strategist; but the greatest strategy in military affairs is that which has been used in gaining advantages in striking a foe rather than in evading him. Of course, rash fighting is all wrong, for it gives the advantage to the other side, but the soldiers who were able to deceive their enemies, and at the same time to deal their sudden and deadly blows when least expected, have been those who have stood highest on the rolls of fame.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6985"/>Returning, however, to our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inquiry as to the reason for the <rs>South</rs>'s defeat, it does not seem difficult to understand that it was for the lack of machinery and skill for manufacturing all our products, and for making all that was required for carrying on the war and for the maintenance of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6986"/>If we had possessed these facilities, the <rs>South</rs> could have lived on its own resources and used barter in default of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6987"/>The trouble was that the <rs>South</rs> possessed the richest material resources a country could have, but for the lack of the arms and the skill for manufacturing them, these resources, rich as they were, could not be made available for the manifold uses of war and peace.</p></div2></div1>
