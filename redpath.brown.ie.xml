<head>Publishers' Card.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In presenting this work, the publishers deem it proper to congratulate themselves and the public on having secured as the biographer of <persName n="Brown,Captain,John,,," id="n0156.0003.00005.00009" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, a gentleman so well qualified, both by personal knowledge and literary ability, for the task, and whose previous life has been so identified in feeling and character with the career of the sainted hero, as to enable him to do that justice to his motives and acts which a less friendly pen would fail to render.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They would also call the attention of the public to the fact that a large percentage on each copy sold is secured by contract to the family of <persName n="Brown,Captain,John,,," id="n0156.0003.00005.00010" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, and every purchaser thereby becomes a contributor to a charitable object, which appeals to all freemen with a force that is irresistible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The publishers would remind the public, and especially the press, that the work is copyrighted, and any reprinting of the <hi rend="italics">Autobiography</hi>, or the chapter entitled <quote>The Father of the man,</quote> will be prosecuted as an infringement, as it is the desire of the friends who contribute <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> it that it should appear exclusively in this volume, for the benefit of the family.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The work is published with the sanction and approval of the family of <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0156.0003.00006.00011" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, as may be seen by the following letters:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>When the news of the arrest of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00007.00020" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> reached <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, I could neither work nor sleep; for I loved and reverenced the noble old man, and had perfect confidence in his plan of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I knew him to be <num value="1">one</num> of earth's worthiest souls &mdash; the last of the <name>Puritans</name>; and yet I heard, on every side, people calling him a madman, and sneering at his <quote>crazy scheme.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Now, or never, was the time to defend my friend, when no voice, however faint, was heard to praise him. An opportunity offered; I indorsed <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00007.00021" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>A few years hence this will seem absurd; as ridiculous, now, as an indorsement of <persName n="Warren,,,,," id="n0156.0004.00007.00022" reg="mostcommon:Warren,nomatch:0"><surname>Warren</surname></persName>; but necessary in <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> last &mdash; and pronounced insane!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I heard of no <num value="1">one</num> man who fully approved my doctrines or defence when my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article appeared; but, before the series that I had contemplated was finished, I turned again to other work &mdash; for already the highest talent of the nation was marshalling to the rescue of the conquering prisoner of Charlestown Jail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Like <persName n="Samson,,,,," id="n0156.0004.00007.00023" reg="mostcommon:Samson,nomatch:0"><surname>Samson</surname></persName>, in a single day, if not with the jawbone of an ass, yet with the help of that of a Member of Congress, the mighty man of valor had smitten his enemies, hip and thigh, <quote>from <persName n="Dan,,,,," id="n0156.0004.00007.00024" reg="mostcommon:Dan,nomatch:0"><surname>Dan</surname></persName> even unto <placeName reg="Beersheba, York, South Carolina" key="tgn,2160485">Beersheba</placeName>, and all the region round about.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Now <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> that the most skilful trained soldiers of Freedom were in the field to encounter the reserve forces of the enemy, I withdrew myself from the conflict for a time-for, a guerilla skirmisher only, unfitted both by habit and nature for a place in any regular army, I did not care to fight under any General, or to fire except where I wanted to kill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A publisher of New York asked me to write a Life of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00008.00025" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He wanted it as a Republican campaign document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I declined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I would not help to light cigars from the fire above the altar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The publishers of this book made a nobler request; they believed in <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00008.00026" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>; they wished to do him justice; and they desired to assist his destitute family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>This volume is the result of their request.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I have written this book, because I could not resist it. Equally at war with the cant of conservatism, of politics, and of non-resistance, and a firm believer in the faith that made <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName> classic, I think that <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00008.00027" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> did right in invading <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and attempting to liberate her slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I hold <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in infinitely greater reverence than Congress, and His holy laws than its enactments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I would as soon think of vindicating <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0156.0004.00008.00028" reg="mostcommon:Washington,Lewis,W.,,:3"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> for resisting the <rs>British Government</rs> to the death, as to apologize for <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00008.00029" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> in assailing the <rs>Slave Power</rs> with the only weapons that it fears.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Therefore, reader, if you think that white makes right, or might makes right, or if the opposite doctrine is abhorrent to you, lay this volume aside at once, for I will not promise that I shall try to avoid giving you offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><pb id="p.9" n="9"/></p> 
<p>I have no apology to make for this book; not because I am unconscious of its defects, but because it is the best that I could write in the allotted time, and because nowhere else can so correct a biography of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00009.00030" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is compiled from hundreds of sources &mdash; newspapers, books, correspondence, and conversations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Much of it, also, is the record of my personal knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Materials came to me from all quarters; and not always in the order of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Thus, the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> chapter of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> book was written <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> after the account of his execution; the history of his <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName> exploits before I obtained the autobiographical sketch of his childhood and youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Hence, if there be occasional repetitions, whether of fact or idea, the just or generous reader will overlook this defect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I do not think that there are such iterations; but it is a possibility that I desire to explain in advance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Writing in this way, the volume grew faster than I foresaw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>I had intended to write the <name>Life</name> of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00009.00031" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, private and public, and biographies of his men, also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But <placeName key="tgn,7007254" n="1.000 191" reg="kansas">Kansas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>, and an unexpected gift of materials from <placeName reg="Isola d' Elba" key="tgn,7006197"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Elba</placeName>, compelled me to defer the biographies of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00009.00032" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>'s men, as well as a minuter record of his own private life and correspondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>For, on the return of my wife from the home of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n0156.0004.00009.00033" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, I found myself in possession, in trust, of hundreds of private letters,--every <num value="1">one</num> that has been preserved,--written during the long and active career of the illustrious <rs>Liberator</rs>, which exhibit his daily life in its every relation, and the exceeding beauty of the religion which inspired its actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>These records, with other <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> memorials of him, will be published, in due time, in a supplementary volume.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The latest telegraphic news makes <num value="1">one</num> correction necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I have spoken of <persName n="Realf,,Richard,,," id="n0156.0004.00010.00034" reg="default:Realf,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Realf</surname></persName> as dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I thought that he died a natural death on the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It appears that he still lives in the body; but dead to honor, the voice of conscience, and the cries of the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He has chosen the part of <persName n="Judas,,,,," id="n0156.0004.00010.00035" reg="mostcommon:Judas,nomatch:0"><surname>Judas</surname></persName>, and promises to play it wells</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I am indebted to several friends for valuable aid in the preparation of this volume--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to every <num value="1">one</num> whom I have mentioned in the notes, or text, or whose letters I have quoted; and to <persName n="Webb,Doctor,Thomas,H.,," id="n0156.0004.00010.00036" reg="default:Webb,Thomas,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Webb</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <persName n="Hinton,,Richard,J.,," id="n0156.0004.00010.00037" reg="default:Hinton,Richard,J.,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Hinton</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, and, lastly, but not least among them, to <quote>a nearer <num value="1">one</num> still and a dearer <num value="1">one</num></quote> for her visit to <placeName reg="Isola d' Elba" key="tgn,7006197"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Elba</placeName> and its results.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>You can measure well by your eye, and are annoyed if you see any thing out of proportion, or not exactly plumb &mdash; have an excellent memory of shape, outline, and size of whatever you see &mdash; are a systematic, methodical man: like to have a place for things, and things in their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Your ability to reckon figures mentally is naturally good-you have a great deal of mechanical ingenuity, are just the man to set others at work, to make bargains, and do up the out-door business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Now that word <hi rend="italics">killed</hi> is a word which <num value="1">one</num> hardly cares to mention in a mourning household circle, even under all mitigating circumstances, when sad unavailing kisses and tender funeral rites have softened the last memories; how much less here, then, where it suggested not merely wounds, and terror, and agony, but also coffinless graves in a hostile land, and the last ignominy of the dissecting room.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Yet there was not <num value="1">one</num> of that family who could not pronounce that awful word with perfect quietness; never, of course, lightly, but always quietly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>For instance, as I sat that evening, with the women busily sewing around me, preparing the mother for her sudden departure with me on the morrow, some daguerreotypes were brought out to show me, and some <num value="1">one</num> said, <quote> This is <persName n="Oliver,,,,," id="n0156.0010.00066.00326" reg="mostcommon:Oliver,nomatch:0"><surname>Oliver</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of those who were killed at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>As the words were spoken in her hearing, not a muscle quivered, and her finger did not tremble as she drew the thread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>For her life had become too real to leave room for wincing at mere words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>She had lived through, beyond the word, to the sterner fact, and having confronted <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, language was an empty shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>To the <name>Browns</name>, killing means simply dying &mdash; nothing more; <num value="1">one</num> gate into heaven, and that <num value="1">one</num> a good deal frequented by their family; that is all.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>I have, may it please the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, a few words to say.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/>In the first place, I deny every thing but what I have all along admitted &mdash; the design on my part to free the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>I intended certainly to have made a clear thing of that matter, as I did last winter, when I went into <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and there took slaves without the snapping of a gun on either side, moved them through the country, and finally left them in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>I designed to have done the same tiling again, on a larger scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>That was all I intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>I never did intend murder, <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> or treason, or the destruction of property, or to excite or incite slaves to rebellion, or to make insurrection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/> I have another objection: and that is, it is unjust that I should suffer such a penalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>Had I interfered in the manner which I admit, and which I admit has been fairly proved--(for I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater portion of the witnesses who have testified in this case)--had I so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great, or in behalf of any of their friends, either father, mother, brother, <rs type="role" n="Sister">sister</rs>, wife, or children, or any of that class, and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference, it would have been all right, and every man in this Court would have deemed it an act worthy of reward rather than punishment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>This Court acknowledges, as I suppose, the validity of the <rs>Law</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>I see a book kissed here which I suppose to be the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, or, at least, the New Testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>That teaches me that all things <quote> whatsoever I would that men should do unto me I should do even so to them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>It teaches me further, to <quote>remember them that are in bonds as bound with them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>I endeavored to act up to that instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>I say, I am yet too young to understand that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is any respecter of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>I believe that to have interfered as I have done, as I have always freely admitted I have done, in behalf of His despised poor, was not wrong, but right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>Now, if it is deemed necessary that I should forfeit my life for the furtherance of the ends of justice, and mingle my blood further with the blood of my children, and with the blood of <num value="1000000">millions</num> in this slave country whose <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> rights are disregarded by wicked, cruel, and unjust enactments &mdash; I submit: so let it be done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>Let me say <num value="1">one</num> word further.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>I feel entirely satisfied with the treatment I have received on my trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>Considering all the circumstances, it has been more generous than I expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>But I feel no consciousness of guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>I have stated from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> what was my intention and what was not. I never had any design against the life of ally person, nor any disposition to commit treason, or excite slaves to rebel, or make any general insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>I never encouraged any man to do so, but always discouraged any idea of that kind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>Let me say, also, a word in regard to the statements made by some of those connected with me. I hear it has been stated by some of them that I have induced them to join me. But the contrary is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>I do not say this to injure them, but as regretting their weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>There is not <num value="1">one</num> of them but joined me of his own accord, and the greater part at their own expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>A number of them I never saw, and never had a word of conversation with, till the day they came to me, and that was for the purpose I have stated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>Now I have done.</p></body></text> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>Perfect quiet prevailed while this speech was delivered; and, when he finished, the <rs>Judge</rs> proceeded to pass sentence on him. After a few preliminary remarks, he stated that no doubt could exist of the guilt of the prisoner, and sentenced him to be hanged by the neck till he was dead, on <date>Friday</date>, the <dateStruct value="-12-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>. <quote>At the announcement,</quote> said a spectator, <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> <quote>that, for the sake of example, the execution would be more than usually public, <num value="1">one</num> indecent fellow, behind the <rs>Judge</rs>'s chair, shouted and clapped hands jubilantly; but he was indignantly checked, and in a manner that induced him to believe that he would do best to retire.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>I will begin by saying that I have in some degree recovered from my wounds, but that I am quite weak in my back, and sore about my left kidney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4140"/>My appetite has been quite good for most of the time since I was hurt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4141"/>I am supplied with almost every thing I could desire to make me comfortable, and <pb id="p.350" n="350"/> the little I do lack (some articles of clothing, which I lost) I may perhaps soon get again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4142"/>I am, besides, quite cheerful, having (as I trust) the peace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which <quote>passeth all understanding,</quote> to <quote>rule in my heart,</quote> and the testimony (in some degree) of a good conscience that I have not lived altogether in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4143"/>I can trust <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with both the time and the manner of my death, believing, as I now do, that for me at this time to seal my testimony (for <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and humanity) with my blood, will do vastly more towards advancing the cause I have earnestly endeavored to promote, than all I have done in my life before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4144"/>I beg of you all meekly and quietly to submit to this; not feeling yourselves in the least <hi rend="italics">degraded</hi> on that account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4145"/>Remember, dear wife and children all, that <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,2091132" n="1.000 3" reg="nazareth, northampton, pennsylvania">Nazareth</placeName> suffered a most excruciating death on the cross as a felon, under the most aggravating circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4146"/>Think, also, of the prophets, and apostles, and Christians of former days, who went through greater tribulations than you or I; and (try to) be reconciled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4147"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> Almighty comfort all your hearts, and soon wipe away all tears from your eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>To him be endless praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4149"/>Think, too, of the crushed <num value="1000000">millions</num> who <quote>,have no comforter.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4150"/>I charge you all never (in your trials) to forget the griefs of <quote>the poor that cry, and of those that have none to help them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4151"/>I wrote most earnestly to my dear and afflicted wife not to come on for the present at any rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4152"/>I will now give her my reasons for doing so. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, it would use up all the scanty means she has, or is at all likely to have, to make herself and children comfortable hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4153"/>For let me tell you that the sympathy that is now aroused in your behalf may not always follow you. There is but little more of the romantic about helping poor widows and their children than there is about trying to relieve poor <quote>niggers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4154"/>Again, the little comfort it might afford us to meet again would be dearly bought by the pains of a final separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4155"/>We must part, and, I feel assured, for us to meet under such dreadful circumstances, would only add to our distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4156"/>If she come on here, she must be only a gazing stock throughout the whole journey, to be remarked upon in every look, word, and action, and by all sorts of creatures, and by all sorts of papers throughout the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4157"/>Again, it is my most decided judgment that in quietly and submissively staying at home, vastly more of generous sympathy will reach her, without such dreadful sacrifice of feeling as she must put up with if she comes on. The visits of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> female friends that have come on here have produced great excitement, which is very annoying, and they cannot possibly do me any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4158"/>O <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>, do not come; but patiently wait for the meeting (of those who love <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and their fellow-men) where no separation must follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>Dear Friend: Although you write to me as a stranger, the spirit you show towards me and the cause for which I am in bonds, makes me feel towards you as a dear friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>I would be glad to have you, or any of my liberty-loving, ministerial friends here, to talk and pray with me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4439"/>My dearly beloved Wife, Sons and Daughters, Every <num value="1">One</num>: As I now begin what is probably the last letter I shall ever write to any of you, I conclude to write to all at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4440"/>I will mention some little matters particularly applicable to little property concerns in another place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4441"/>I recently received a letter from my wife, from near <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, dated <dateStruct value="-11-22"><month reg="11">Nov.</month> <day reg="22">22</day></dateStruct>, by which it would seem that she was about giving up the idea of seeing me again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4442"/>I had written her to come on if she felt equal to the undertaking, but I do not know that she will get my letter in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4443"/>It was on her own account chiefly that I asked her to stay back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4444"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> I had a most strong desire to see her again, but there appeared to be very serious objections; and should we never meet in this life, I trust that she will in the end be satisfied it was for the best at least, if not most for her comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4445"/>I enclosed in my last letter to her a draft of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> from <persName n="Jay,,John,,," id="n0156.0052.00365.02226" reg="default:Jay,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Jay</surname></persName>, made payable to her order.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4447"/>I am waiting the hour of my public murder with great composure of mind and cheerfulness, feeling the strong assurance that in no other possible way could I be used to so much advantage to the cause of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and of humanity, and that nothing that either I or all my family have sacrificed or suffered will be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4448"/>The reflection that a wise and merciful, as well as just and holy <name n="God" type="God">God</name> rules not only the affairs of this world, but of all worlds, is a rock to set our feet upon under all circumstances &mdash; even those more severely trying ones into which our own feelings and wrongs have placed us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4449"/>So, my dear shattered and broken family, be of good cheer, and believe and trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> with all your heart, and with all your soul, for he doeth all things well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4451"/>I bless <name n="God" type="God">God</name> I never felt stronger confidence in the certain and near approach of a bright morning and glorious day than I have felt, and do now feel, since my confinement here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4452"/>I am endeavoring to return, like a poor prodigal as I am, to my Father, against whom I have always sinned, in the hope that he may kindly and forgivingly meet me, though a very great way off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4453"/>O, my dear wife and children, would to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> you could know how I have been travailing in birth for you all, that no <num value="1">one</num> of you may fail of the grace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> through <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n0156.0052.00365.02228" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>; that no <num value="1">one</num> of you <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> may be blind to the truth and glorious light of his Word, in which life and immortality are brought to light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4454"/>I beseech you, every <num value="1">one</num>, to make the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> your daily and nightly study, with a child-like, honest, candid, teachable spirit of love and respect for your husband and father.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4455"/>And I beseech the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of my fathers to open all your eyes to the discovery of the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4456"/>You cannot imagine how much you may soon need the consolations of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4457"/>Circumstances like my own, for more than a month past, have convinced me beyond all doubt of our great need of some theories treasured up when our prejudices are excited, our vanity worked up to the highest pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4458"/>O, do not trust your eternal all upon the boisterous ocean without even a helm or compass to aid you in steering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4459"/>I do not ask of you to throw away your reason; I only ask you to make a candid, sober use of your reason.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4460"/>My dear young children, will you listen to this last poor admonition of <num value="1">one</num> who can only love you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/>O, be determined at once to give your whole heart to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and let nothing shake or alter that resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4462"/>You need have no fears of regretting it. Do not be vain and thoughtless, but sober-minded; and let me entreat you all to love the whole remnant of our once great family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4463"/>Try and build up again your broken walls, and to make the utmost of every stone that is left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/>Nothing can so tend to make life a blessing as the consciousness that your life and example bless and leave you the stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>Still, it is ground of the utmost comfort to my mind to know that so many of you as have had the opportunity have given some proof of your fidelity to the great family of men. Be faithful unto death; from the exercise of habitual love to man it cannot be very hard to love his Maker.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>I must yet insert the reason for my firm belief in the divine inspiration of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, notwithstanding I am, perhaps, naturally sceptical; certainly not credulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>I wish all to consider it most thoroughly when you read that blessed book, and see whether you cannot discover such evidence yourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4468"/>It is the purity of heart, filling our minds as well as work and actions, which is every where insisted on, that distinguishes it from all the other teachings, that commends it to my conscience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>Whether my heart be willing and obedient or not, the inducement that it holds out is another reason of my convictions of its truth and genuineness; but I do not here omit this my last argument on the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, that eternal life is what my soul is panting after this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4470"/>I mention this as a reason for endeavoring to leave a valuable copy of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, to be carefully preserved in remembrance of me, to so many of my posterity, instead of some other book at equal cost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>I beseech you all to live in habitual contentment with moderate <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> circumstances and gains of worldly store, and earnestly to teach this to your children and children's children after you, by example as well as precept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>Be determined to know by experience, as soon as may be, whether Bible instruction is of divine origin or not. Be sure to owe no man any thing, but to love <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4506"/>There need be no such confliction, and a few words of explanation will, I think, be quite sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4508"/>In the hurry of the moment, I forgot much that I had before intended to say, and did not consider the full bearing of what I then said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4509"/>I intended to convey this idea: that it was my intention to place the slaves in a condition to defend their liberties if they would, without any bloodshed, but not that I intended to run them out of the <rs>Slave States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4510"/>I was not aware of any such apparent confliction until my attention was called to it, and I do not suppose that a man in my then circumstances should be superhuman in respect to the exact purport of every word he might utter.

In this state of feeling, sensitive as an enthusiast in giving to the world the motives of an act which, to his own diseased mind, was great and good, but which the world must condemn, he claimed with petulance and impatience those delays in the administration of the law which neither his crimes nor the circumstances of the court could fairly admit of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/><hi rend="italics">Jail Official</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>He gave the same reason yesterday for his refusal to accept the services of some clergymen who called upon him. He also said he would as soon be attended to the scaffold by blacklegs or robbers of the worst kind as by slaveholding ministers, or ministers sympathizing with slavery, and that if he had his choice he would prefer being followed to the scaffold by barefooted, barelegged, ragged negro children, and their old gray-headed slave-mother, than by clergymen of this Character.

While making these remarks, he requests that he would not be understood as designing to offer any insult.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>He expressed an idea that it would be well to have the flesh burned off the bodies of all, and their bones boxed up, so that they might be carried home with more convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>In expressing this wish he remarked that he meant to 4o no violence to <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> the feelings or <name>Christian</name> sentiments of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 8" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.
