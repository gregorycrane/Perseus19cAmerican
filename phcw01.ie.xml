<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Seldom indeed has it been possible to construct the text of such an extended history in accordance with a single broad idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Yet it is true that the contributions throughout the entire <num value="10">ten</num> volumes of the <title>Photographic history</title> are a direct outgrowth of the plan created years ago by <persName n="Miller,Mister,,,," id="n0106.0002.00014.00010" reg="nearbymention:Miller,Francis,Trevelyan,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Miller</surname></persName>, and urged since by him with constant faith in its national importance &mdash; to emphasize in comprehensive form those deeds and words from the mighty struggle that strike universal, noble human chords.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>On this semi-centennial of the <rs>American Civil War</rs> &mdash; the war of the modern Roses in the <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western World</orgName>--these volumes are dedicated to the <rs>American</rs> people in tribute to the courage and the valor with which they met <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest crises that a nation has ever known &mdash; a crisis that changed the course of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We look back at <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName> through the glamor of time, without fully realizing that here on our own continent are battle-grounds more noble in their purport than all the wars of the ancient regimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The decades have shrouded the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> American Revolution in romance, but the time has now come when this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> American revolution, at the turning point of its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half century, is to become an American epic in which nearly <num value="3.5">three and a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> men gathered on the battle-line to offer their lives for principles that were dear to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is as an American <quote>Battle <persName n="Abbey,,,,," id="n0106.0003.00015.00033" reg="mostcommon:Abbey,nomatch:0"><surname>Abbey</surname></persName></quote> that these pages are opened on this anniversary, so that the eyes of the generations may look upon the actual scenes &mdash; not upon the tarnished muskets, the silenced cannon, nor the battle-stained flag, but upon the warriors themselves standing on the firing-line in the heroic struggle when the hosts of the <rs>North</rs> and the legions of the <rs>South</rs> met on the battle-grounds of a nation's ideals, with the destiny of a continent hanging in the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>And what a tribute it is to American character to be able to gather about these pages in peace and brotherhood, without malice and without dissension, within a generation from the greatest fratricidal tragedy in the annals of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The vision is no longer blinded by heart wounds, but as <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0106.0003.00015.00034" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> we can see only the heroic self-sacrifice of these men who battled for the decision of <num value="1">one</num> of the world's greatest problems.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In this <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume, standing literally before the open door to the <quote>Battle <persName n="Abbey,,,,," id="n0106.0003.00015.00035" reg="mostcommon:Abbey,nomatch:0"><surname>Abbey</surname></persName>,</quote> in which the vision of war is to be revealed in all its reality, I take this privilege to refer briefly to a few of the intimate desires that have led to this revelation of <title>The photographic history of the <rs>Civil War</rs>.</title> As <num value="1">one</num> stands in the library of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, or before the archives of the <rs>American</rs> libraries, he feels that the last word of evidence must have been recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Nearly <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> treatises, containing varying viewpoints relating to this epoch in our national development, have been written &mdash; so <persName n="Putnam,Doctor,Herbert,,," id="n0106.0003.00015.00036" reg="default:Putnam,Herbert,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Herbert</foreName> <surname>Putnam</surname></persName>, Librarian at the <orgName n="Congressional Library" type="library">Congressional Library</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, tells me; while in my home city of <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName>, which is a typical American community, I find nearly <num value="2000">two thousand</num> works similar to those that are within the reach of all the <rs>American</rs> people in every part of the country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>With this great inheritance before us, military writers have informed me that they cannot understand why the <rs>American</rs> people have been so little interested in this remarkable war. Great generals have told how they led their magnificent armies in battle; military tacticians have mapped and recorded the movements of regiments and corps with technical <pb id="p.16" n="16"/>accuracy, and historians have faithfully discussed the causes and the effects of this strange crisis in civilization-all of which is a permanent tribute to American scholarship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I have come to the conclusion that the lack of popular interest is because this is not a military nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The great heart of American citizenship knows little of military maneuver, which is a science that requires either life-study or tradition to cultivate an interest in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <rs>Americans</rs> are a peace-loving people, but when once aroused they are a mighty moral and physical fighting force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is not their love for the art of war that has caused them to take up arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>History, even of the most shadowy and legendary sort, goes back hardly more than <measure n="10000years" type="date">ten thousand years</measure>. But in recent years there have been recovered in certain caves of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> scratched and carved bone weapons and rough wall-paintings which tell us some dramatic events in the lives of men who lived probably a <measure n="100000years" type="date">hundred thousand years</measure> before the earliest of those <num value="7">seven</num> strata of ancient <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy</placeName>, which indefatigable archeologists have exposed to the wondering gaze of the modern world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The picture came long before the written record; nearly all our knowledge of ancient Babylonia and Assyria is gleaned from the details left by some picture-maker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>And it is still infinitely more effective an appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>How impossible it is for the average person to get any clear idea of the great struggles which altered the destinies of nations and which occupy so large a portion of world history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The superior navy of the <rs>Federals</rs> at the beginning and throughout the war enabled them to gain the advantage of penetrating the rivers leading into the interior of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and thus support the military forces in many telling movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>But strategy, unfortunately, is a very unpopular science, even among soldiers, requiring both in practice and in demonstration constant and careful study of the map, the closest computation of time and space, a grasp of may factors, and the strictest attention to the various steps in the problems it presents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>At the same time, it is a science which repays the student, although he may have no direct concern with military affairs; for not only will a comprehension of its immutable principles add a new interest to the records of stirring times and great achievements, but will make him a more useful citizen.--<title><persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0106.0008.00112.00525" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and the <rs>Civil War</rs></title>, by <persName n="Henderson,Lieutenant-Colonel,G.,F.,R.," id="n0106.0008.00112.00526" reg="default:Henderson,G.,F.,R.,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Henderson</surname></persName>, C.
