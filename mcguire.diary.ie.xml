<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>This <quote>Diary</quote> sees the light unexpectedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>In its origin nothing of the sort was anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>During its progress the writer often said, <quote>I am keeping this for the members of the family who are too young to remember these days.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Nothing was intended but a private record, into which friends and kindred might in coming years look with some pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>They will hear much of the <rs>War</rs> of Secession, and will take special interest in the thoughts and records of <num value="1">one</num> of their own family who had passed through the wonderful scenes of this great revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Subsequent circumstances have led to its publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>Partial friends think that others might be interested by its pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>It was kept at points of great interest in connection with the men and events of the war. There was every opportunity, and certainly every intention, to keep a true record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>Enormous as were the wrongs done us, yet we had no desire to do the slightest wrong to even the bitterest of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We refused not to do them justice; we were not unwilling to seek for them the mercy of Heaven; to extend to them the hand of Charity; to supply their wants when captured; to attend as far as possible to their sick, and dying, and dead; and asked for nothing from them but that they would leave our borders, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> never to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We could not forget the injury done to our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>If what we wrote indicates this, what is it but the voice of nature, which neither fear nor hope could repress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The ruin of the whole South!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Where are the colours dark enough for that picture?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>With her rightful government overturned; her territory seized by lawless hands; her system of domestic labour suddenly broken up; her estates robbed; her fields desolated; her barns destroyed by fire; her temples profaned; her once joyous homes here and there silent as death; her old men and women going with sorrow to the grave, because their gallant sons are not; her fair and fainting daughters mourning for loved ones whom they girded for the fight, and saw again never more; her widows and orphans, whom sorrow may kill, if want does not starve them; her wounded, and scarred, and crippled, and suffering, with no rest for any save in the quiet graves at home, or in the vast cemeteries, where such hosts of her slaughtered children lie. How must we think or speak of all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Let the coldest heart ever frozen by Northern interest or prejudice answer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Shall this breach never be healed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Are there no able and patriotic men <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>--no men of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-fitted to achieve this work without further injury or shame to either party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This great revolution cannot be without <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-without whom not a sparrow falls to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If there be error or mischief, that is of man. With <name n="God" type="God">God</name> <quote><num value="1">one</num> day is as a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure>, and a <measure n="1000years" type="date">thousand years</measure> as <num value="1">one</num> day.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He sees the end from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>His great <quote>purposes run along the line of ages,</quote> and, worked out as He ordains, produce good, and good only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>For ages He has blessed the <rs>South</rs> with the fairest land, the purest social circle, the noblest race of men, and the happiest people, on <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Under a mysterious <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, <num value="1000000">millions</num> of the coloured race have been saved from the foulest paganism; <num value="1000000">millions</num> mentally and morally elevated far above those of their native land, and multitudes saved in <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0028.0001.00007.00001" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Is it <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> purpose to break up this system?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Who can believe that it was His will to do it by war and bloodshed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Or that turning this people loose without preparation, a rapid demoralization, idleness, poverty and vice should doom so many of them to misery, or send them so rapidly to the grave?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In this transition state, must the earth remain uncultivated, and its fruits so lessened as to reduce all to comparative poverty, and threaten such numbers with actual starvation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Must a war of races come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Must a spirit of bitter hatred burn on between the sections of our unhappy country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Why not <num value="1">one</num> of peace and forgiveness instead?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Why not the healing balm of love?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Why not the spirit of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0028.0001.00007.00002" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, pervading all hearts, and binding up all wounds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> of love, hasten the day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We are verily in need of His gracious assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We have cried to Him through many a gloomy day. The days are dark and dreary still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The old <rs>South</rs> has passed away; her music is all dead; her harp hung where no mortal hand can sweep its chords again, and the very winds of Heaven can bring from it naught save a few wailing notes, sad enough to break every human heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p></p><l part="F">Mourn </l><l>Her banished peace, her laurels torn; </l><l>Her sons, for valour long renowned, </l><l>Lie slaughtered on their native ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The following pages are, as intimated above, presented to the public more in compliance with the wishes of others than of the writer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>She has no experience in matters of this sort, and claims nothing except what may be due to sincerity and truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Her earnest prayer is, that what is erroneous may be forgiven her, and the whole result be agreeable and useful to her readers. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I am too nervous, too wretched to-day to write in my diary, but that the employment will while away a few moments of this trying time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Our friends and neighbors have left us. Every thing is broken up. The <orgName n="Theological Seminary" type="seminary">Theological Seminary</orgName> is closed ; the <orgName n="High School" type="school">High School</orgName> dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Scarcely any <num value="1">one</num> is left of the many families which surrounded us. The homes all look desolate; and yet this beautiful country is looking more peaceful, more lovely than ever, as if to rebuke the tumult of passion and the fanaticism of man. We are left lonely indeed; our children are all gonethe girls to <persName n="Clarke,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00009.00003" reg="mostcommon:Clarke,nomatch:0"><surname>Clarke</surname></persName>, where they may be safer, and farther from the exciting scenes which may too soon surround us; and the boys, the dear, dear boys, to the camp, to be drilled and prepared to meet any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Can it be that our country is to be carried on and on to the horrors of civil war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I pray, oh how fervently do I pray, that our <name n="God" type="God">Heavenly Father</name> may yet avert it. I shut my eyes and hold my breath when the thought of what may come upon us obtrudes itself; and yet I cannot believe it. It will, I know the breach will be healed without the effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The taking of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> without bloodshed has somewhat <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> soothed my fears, though I am told by those who are wiser than I, that men must fall on both sides by the score, by the <num value="100">hundred</num>, and even by the <num value="1000">thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>But it is not my habit to look on the dark side, so I try hard to employ myself, and hope for the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>To-day our house seems so deserted, that I feel more sad than usual, for on this morning we took leave of our whole household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs>--and myself are now the sole occupants of the house, which usually teems with life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I go from room to room, looking at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> thing and then another, so full of sad associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The closed piano, the locked bookcase, the nicely-arranged tables, the formally-placed chairs, ottomans and sofas in the parlor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Oh for some <num value="1">one</num> to put them out of order!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>And then the dinner-table, which has always been so well surrounded, so social, so cheerful, looked so cheerless to-day, as we seated ourselves <num value="1">one</num> at the head, the other at the foot, with <num value="1">one</num> friend,--but <num value="1">one</num>,--at the side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I could scarcely restrain my tears, and but for the presence of that <num value="1">one</num> friend, I believe I should have cried outright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>After dinner, I did not mean to do it, but I could not help going into the girls' room, and then into C.&lsquo;s. I heard my own footsteps so plainly, that I was startled by the absence of all other sounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>There the furniture looked so quiet, the beds so fixed and smooth, the wardrobes and bureaux so tightly locked, and the whole so lifeless!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>But the writing-desks, <rs n="work boxes" type="product">work-boxes</rs>, and the numberless things so familiar to my eyes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Where were they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>I paused, to ask myself what it all meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Why did we think it necessary to send off all that was so dear to us from our own home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I threw open the shutters, and the answer came at once, so mournfully!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>I heard distinctly the drums beating in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The evening was so still that I seemed to hear nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>As <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I looked at the <rs>Capitol</rs> in the distance, I could scarcely believe my senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>That <name>Capitol</name> of which I had always been so proud!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Can it be possible that it is no longer <hi rend="italics">our</hi> <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">Capitol</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>And are our countrymen, under its very eaves, making mighty preparation to drain our hearts' blood? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>And must this Union, which I was taught to revere, be rent asunder?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Once I thought such a suggestion sacrilege; but now that it is dismembered, I trust it may never, never be reunited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>We must be a separate people-our nationality must be different, to insure lasting peace and good-will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Why cannot we part in peace?</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Since writing last, I have been busy, very busy, arranging and rearranging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We are now hoping that <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> will not be a landing-place for the enemy, but that the forts will be attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In that case, they would certainly be repulsed, and we could stay quietly at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>To view the progress of events from any point will be sad enough, but it would be more bearable at our own home, and surrounded by our family and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>With the supposition that we may remain, and that the ladies of the family at least may return to us, I am having the grounds put in order, and they are now so beautiful!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Lilacs, crocuses, the lily of the valley, and other spring flowers, are in luxuriant bloom, and the roses in full bud. The greenhouse plants have been removed and grouped on the lawn, verbenas in bright bloom have been transplanted from the <hi rend="italics">pit</hi> to the borders, and the grass seems unusually green after the late rains; the trees are in full leaf; every thing is so fresh and lovely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><quote>All, save the spirit of man, is divine.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/></p> 
<p>War seems inevitable, and while I am trying to employ the passing hour, a cloud still hangs over us and all that surrounds us. For a long time before our society was <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> so completely broken up, the ladies of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> and all the surrounding country were busily employed sewing for our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Shirts, pants, jackets, and beds, of the heaviest material, have been made by the most delicate fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>All ages, all conditions, meet now on <num value="1">one</num> common platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>We must all work for our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Our soldiers must be equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Our parlor was the rendezvous for our neighborhood, and our <rs n="sewing machine" type="product">sewing-machine</rs> was in requisition for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Scissors and needles were plied by all. The daily scene was most animated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The fires of our enthusiasm and patriotism were burning all the while to a degree which might have been consuming, but that our tongues served as safetyvalves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Oh, how we worked and talked, and excited each other!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/><num value="1">One</num> common sentiment animated us all; no doubts, no fears were felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>We all have such entire reliance in the justice of our cause and the valor of our men, and, above all, on the blessing of Heaven!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>These meetings have necessarily ceased with us, as so few of any age or degree remain at home; but in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> they are still kept up with great interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>We who are left here are trying to give the soldiers who are quartered in town comfort, by carrying them milk, butter, pies, cakes, etc. I went in yesterday to the barracks, with the carriage well filled with such things, and found many young friends quartered there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>All are taking up arms; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> young men in the country are the most zealous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/><placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> is doing her duty nobly; so is <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00012.00004" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,Randolph,,,:1"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>; and so, I hope, is the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>We are very weak in resources, but strong in stout hearts, zeal for the cause, and enthusiastic devotion to our beloved South; and while men are making a free &mdash; will offering of their life's blood on the altar of their country, women must not be idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>We must do what we can for the comfort of our brave <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> men. We must sew for them, knit for them, nurse the sick, keep up the faint-hearted, give them a word of encouragement in season and out of season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>There is much for us to do, and we must do it. The embattled hosts of the <rs>North</rs> will have the whole world from which to draw their supplies; but if, as it seems but too probable, our ports are blockaded, we shall indeed be dependent on our own exertions, and great must those exertions be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The Confederate flag waves from several points in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>: from the <rs type="place">Marshall House</rs>, the <rs type="place">Market-house</rs>, and the several barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The peaceful, quiet old town looks quite warlike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>I feel sometimes, when walking on <persName n="King,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00013.00005" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>'s street, meeting men in uniform, passing companies of cavalry, hearing martial music, etc., that I must be in a dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Oh that it were a dream, and that the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of our country's history were blotted out!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Some of our old men are a little nervous, look doubtful, and talk of the impotency of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Oh, I feel utter scorn for such remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>We must not admit weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Our soldiers do not think of weakness : they know that their hearts are strong, and their hands well skilled in the use of the rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> boys have been brought up on horseback, and hunting has ever been their holiday sport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Then why shall they feel weak?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Their hearts feel strong when they think of the justice of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>In that is <hi rend="italics">our</hi> hope. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Walked down this evening to see--. The road looked lonely and deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Busy life has departed from our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We found <rs type="role2">Mrs</rs>.--packing up valuables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>I have been doing the same ; but after they are packed, where are they to be sent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Silver may be buried, but what is to be done with books, pictures, etc.? We have determined, if we are obliged to go from home, to leave every thing in the care of <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> the servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>They have promised to be faithful, and I believe they will be; but my hope becomes stronger and stronger that we may remain here, or may soon return if we go away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Every thing is so sad around us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>We went to the <rs type="place">Chapel</rs> on Sunday as usual, but it was grievous to see the change &mdash; the organ mute, the organist gone; the seats of the students of both institutions empty; but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> members of each family to represent the absentees; the prayer for the <rs>President</rs> omitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>When <rs type="role">Dr.</rs>-- came to it, there was a slight pause, and then he went on to the next prayer-all seemed so strange!

He was feebly supported by all who were not in tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Busy every moment of time packing up, that our furniture may be safely put away in case of a sudden removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The parlor furniture has been rolled into the <name>Laboratory</name>, and covered, to keep it from injury; the books are packed up; the pictures put away with care; house linen locked up, and all other things made as secure as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>We do not hope to remove many things, but to prevent their ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>We are constantly told that a large army would do great injury if quartered near us; therefore we want to put things out of the reach of the soldiers, for I have no idea that officers would allow them to break locks, or that they would allow our furniture to be interfered with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>We have a most unsettled feeling &mdash; with carpets up, curtains down, and the rooms without furniture; but a constant excitement, and expectation of we know not what, supplants all other feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> roses of the season are just appearing, and the peonies are splendid; but the horrors of war, with which we are so seriously threatened, prevent the enjoyment of any thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Let States, like individuals, be independent-be something or nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>I believe that the very best people of both States are with us, but are held back by stern necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Yesterday evening we rode to the parade-ground in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>; it was a beautiful but sad sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>How many of those young, brave boys may be cut off, or maimed for life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>I shudder to think of what a single battle may bring forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The Federal <term type="ship">vessel</term> <rs type="ship">Pawnee</rs> now lies before the old town, with its guns pointing towards it. It is aggravating enough to see it; but the inhabitants move on as calmly as though it were a messenger of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It is said that an undefended, indefensible town like <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> will hardly be attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Our people are busy in their preparations for defence; but time is necessary-every day is precious to us. Our <rs type="role2">President</rs> and military chiefs are doing all that men can do to forward preparations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>With a heavy heart I packed trunks and boxes, as many as our little carriage would hold; had packingboxes <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> fixed in my room for the purpose of bringing off valuables of various sorts, when I go down on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>; locked up every thing; gave the keys to the cook, enjoining upon the servants to take care of the cows, <quote><placeName reg="Old Rock">Old Rock</placeName>,</quote> the garden, the flowers, and last, but not least, J--&lsquo;s splendid <placeName reg="Newfoundland" key="tgn,7005807">Newfoundland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Every preparation was made to deceive the enemy, by inducing him to believe that we meditated a vigorous resistance Meantime our column defiled through a densely wooded road, and was far on the way to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> when the enemy discovered his mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>We were the last to leave the village, and as we went out at <num value="1">one</num> end of the street, his column appeared at the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>We halted at this place about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the afternoon, and again made show of battle-slept until <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> at the heads of our horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>We silently left the place, the enemy's pickets being within hailing distance of our own. At daybreak we were across <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, having marched very slowly to keep pace with the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>We found beds of leaves in the woods, wrapped ourselves in our blankets, and slept for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, until we were aroused by the roar of the enemy's guns as he opened his batteries upon our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>For <num value="2">two</num> mortal hours shot and shell flew thick along our whole line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>This day's work was evidently intended only to draw the fire of our artillery, and show where our batteries were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>In consequence of which our <pb id="p.57" n="57"/> gunners were ordered not to fire a single shot, unless within point-blank range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>After thus opening the ball, <num value="2">two</num> dense masses of infantry were sent to defile to the right and left, to make <num value="2">two</num> separate attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>It was indeed a beautiful sight as they came down in perfect order, and with the stealthy step of veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>They came nearer and yet nearer, and yet no shot from our guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Our men began to mutter, and say that we were preparing for another retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>But in a few moments the appointed time arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>A single shot from the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> gave the signal of death, and for half an hour there was nothing but a continuous sheet of flame along the right of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The enemy fell back, rallied, and charged again, with a like result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>Again they rested, and rushed forward, but old <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was true to herself, and the gallant <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 17">Seventeenth</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 18">Eighteenth Regiments</orgName> charged them with the bayonet, and drove them back in utter confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>The cavalry were held in reserve, and although within range of the artillery, and constantly experiencing the sensation which men may be supposed to indulge, who know there is a hidden danger hovering in the air, without knowing where it is to light, took no part in the action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Our time came yesterday, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Our troop was for <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> in the hottest of the fight, and every man in it won the applause and approbation of the whole camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>The action commenced at <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> on the sweet Sabbath morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The enemy commenced with quite a heavy cannonade upon our right, which proved to be a mere feint, to distract our attention, as his main attack was directed to our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>At <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the enemy had crossed the river on our left, and then the fighting commenced in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>From the hill on which we stood, we could see, from the smoke and dust, though at <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> the distance of several miles, how the fight was waging on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Some thought the enemy was retreating; others that our men had fallen back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>It was an hour of painful interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>At <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> an aid-de-camp rode up in a gallop, and said our men were retiring &mdash; the cavalry was ordered to the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>We were temporarily attached to <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Radford,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00058.00101" reg="mostcommon:Radford,nomatch:0"><surname>Radford</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>-ours was the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first company</orgName>, and mine was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> platoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>On we dashed in a gallop, and as we passed within range of a battery of rifled cannon a ball was fired at us which passed between <persName n="Wickham,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00058.00102" reg="mostcommon:Wickham,John,,,:1"><surname>Wickham</surname></persName> and myself, knocking up a cloud of dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Without wavering in their ranks, the men and horses dashed forward at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>As we reached the scene of action the sight was discouraging in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>The enemy had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the advantage of every attacking party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>He had concentrated his forces for an attack upon <num value="1">one</num> point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="1LARegiment">First Louisiana Regiment</orgName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">Fourth Alabama</orgName>, attacked in flank and centre by <num value="30000">30,000</num> men, were literally cut to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>They refused to surrender, but retired slowly, disputing every inch of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>As we rode up we could meet parts of companies which had been utterly overwhelmed &mdash; the men wounded, their arms broken, while some of them were carrying off their dead in blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Every thing looked like retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>We were ordered up to within <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> of the enemy's artillery, behind a hill which afforded some protection against their destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>For <num value="1">one</num> hour the fire raged with incessant fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>A ball passed over the hill and through our ranks, grazing <num value="1">one</num> of our men.

I can give you no conception of that awful hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Not a man shrank from his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/><num value="2">Two</num> of our men were taken exceedingly sick, <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> fainting from the heat and excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Such calmness and composure I never witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>To make the matter worse, despondency, if not despair, was fast writing itself upon every face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>The fire was evidently approaching us. Our friends were retiring, and the whispered rumour passed from lip to lip that our artillery ammunition was running low. In a moment, however, a cloud of dust in our rear showed the approach of our wagons, coming up at a dashing rate, with a fresh supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Our reinforcements now commenced pouring in. <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> swept by in their glittering array with the calm light of battle on their faces, and their bayonets gleaming in the quiet Sabbath sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>No man faltered, no man lagged behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Neither the groans of the dying nor the shrieks of the wounded, as they passed by in crowded ambulances, seemed to produce any impression except to fix the determination upon the countenances of all, to win or to die upon the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The tide now seemed to ebb, just enough to keep us from despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>The firing did not advance, although the explosion of their shells was terrific in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>A gleam of hope, too, gradually broke in upon us, when <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Kemper,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00059.00104" reg="mostcommon:Kemper,nomatch:0"><surname>Kemper</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, which had been posted in our centre, galloped up and opened a destructive fire upon our extreme left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>The advance was evidently checked, when a loud cheer in the front told us that something unusual had happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>What was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Was it the triumph of our enemies over our poor stricken friends ; or was it some advantage gained by courage in defence of right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>The suspense was awful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Men stood straight in their stirrups and stretched their eyes as if they could pierce the rugged bosom of the barren hill which raised its scarred front between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>An aid passed up. His message is written <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> on his face, and before he speaks a word a wild shout breaks from the throats of <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>When he speaks, another, another and another round of cheers told the story to our hitherto sinking hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="4VARegiment">Fourth Virginia Regiment</orgName> had taken <orgName n="RI Battery"><persName n="Sprague,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00060.00105" reg="mostcommon:Sprague,nomatch:0"><surname>Sprague</surname></persName>'s Rhode Island Battery</orgName> of <num value="6">six</num> pieces, at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Scarcely had the echo of our cheers died away when again the noise of shouting broke upon the air. What was it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Had the enemy rallied and retaken the guns?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Fear struggled with hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>But no: the gallant <num value="27" type="ordinal">Twenty-seventh</num>, envious of the glorious achievement of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num>, at a single dash had charged a regiment of regulars, swept them from the field, and taken every gun in <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00060.00106" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>.<note anchored="yes">

<p>note by the <name>Publishers</name>.-Both the statements are probably true, to some extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>For <num value="1">one</num> hour there was an incessant cracking of rifles, without a single moment's pause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>The enemy were evidently retiring, and unless reinforced from the left and centre, the day was ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>To prevent this, our field telegraph had already given the signal for movement upon our own right, and a heavy fire of musketry and artillery told us that <orgName n="Brigade"><persName n="Bonham,,,,," id="n0028.0002.00060.00110" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonham</surname></persName>'s Brigade</orgName>, to which we had been attached in the morning, had crossed the run and were pouring it into the enemy's centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Our whole body of cavalry, <num value="2700">2,700</num> strong, now rushed like the wind to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>It was indeed a brilliant spectacle, as, <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> with slackened rein and sabres drawn, the whole command dashed past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>It was very sad, because we knew not when and under what circumstances we might meet again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>The Methodist clergyman being nearest, gave up his seat and took hers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>The change was soon effected amidst the most uproarious laughter, all feeling that they were fairly outgeneralled the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>In the mean time the cars arrived, crowded with soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>It was very dark and cold; the confusion and noise were excessive-shouting, hallooing, hurrahing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>We passed through the dense crowd, and into the cars, with some difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> -- returned to look for the baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>At last all seemed ready, and off we went; but what was our horror to find that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>-- was not in the cars!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>All the stories that we had ever heard of persons being thrown from the train as they attempted to get on, arose to our imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The darkness and crowd were great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1067"/>Might he not have been thrown from the platform?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>We became more and more uneasy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>The conductor came by; I questioned him, thinking he might be in another car. He replied, <quote>No, madam, there is no such gentleman on the train.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>At this moment the <rs>Methodist</rs> minister, who had been in the stage, introduced himself as <persName n="Jones,Reverend,,,," id="n0028.0003.00079.00164" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>I can never forget his kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>He thought Mr.-- had not attempted to get on the train; there was so much baggage from the stage that there was some difficulty in arranging it ; he would telegraph from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> when we stopped to change cars, and the answer would meet us at <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1073"/>All this was a great relief to us. At <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> he attended to our baggage; <num value="1">one</num> piece was wanting-a box, which <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> J. had seen in <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>--&lsquo;s hands, just before the train set off; he seemed convinced that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>--was detained by an ineffectual effort to get that box on the car. At <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName> we found J. waiting for us at the depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1074"/>Our kind and Rev. friend did not give up his supervision of us until he saw us under J's care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1075"/>We immediately <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> applied at the office for our expected telegram; but it was not there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1076"/>As it was Christmas-day, the office was closed at a very early hour, which seemed to me a strange arrangement, considering the state of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1077"/>J. felt no uneasiness about his father, but was greatly disappointed, as he had expected to pass that day with him. I had heard in <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> that my nephew, <persName n="Phelps,,W.,B.,," id="n0028.0003.00080.00165" reg="default:Phelps,W.,B.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Phelps</surname></persName>, had been wounded in the unfortunate fight at <placeName key="tgn,2111512" n="1.000 46" reg="dranesville, fairfax, virginia">Dranesville</placeName>, and felt great uneasiness about him; but J. had seen persons directly from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, who reported him slightly wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1078"/>This relieved my mind, but it was most unfortunate; for, had I known the truth, I should have gone on the return train to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and thence to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, for the purpose of nursing him. We spent Christmas-day at the hotel, and dined with a number of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1079"/>In the afternoon we were very much gratified to meet with the family of our neighbour, Captain J. The <rs>Captain</rs> is stationed here, and the ladies have made themselves very comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1080"/>We took tea with them, and talked over our mutual troubles: our lost homes-our scattered families and friends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/>The next morning the train came at the usual hour, bringing Mr.-- . Some difficulty in putting a small box of books on the car had caused a slight detention, and as he was almost in the act of stepping on board, the train moved off, and there he was, left in the dead of a winter's night, without shelter, (for, strange to say, there is no stationhouse at <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>,) without light, and with no <num value="1">one</num> to whom he could apply for assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>He walked back to the village, and there, to use his own expression, he <quote>verily thought he should have to spend the freezing night in the street.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>At a number of houses he knocked loud and long, but not a door was opened to him. At last a young man in an <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> office, after giving scrutinizing glances through the window, opened his door and gave him a chair by his fire, assigning as a reason for the difficulty in getting accommodations, that the number of disorderly soldiers passing through the village made it dangerous to open the houses during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>At daybreak he got on a freight train, hoping to find at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> the means of getting to <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName> that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>In this he was disappointed, and had a most unpleasant trip on the train, which did not reach <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> until sunset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>There he found no place to sleep, and nothing to eat, until a colonel, whose name he unfortunately has forgotten, invited him to his quarters in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>He accepted the invitation most gladly, and as it was very dark, he took a servant as a guide, who proved to know no more about the way than he did; so that both blundered and stumbled along a muddy lane, over fences, through a corn-field, over the stalks and corn-beds, until, by what seemed a mere accident, they came upon the longed &mdash; for house and found rest for the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>Next morning we joined him on the train, delighted to see him safe and sound, feeling that <quote>all's well that ends well ;</quote> we proceeded pleasantly on our journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>J. accompanied us as far as <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, that he might have <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> with his father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>That evening we reached this place after dark, and found a house full of friends and relatives &mdash; the house at S. H. also full-so that it was a real family gathering, as in days of yore; and to add to our pleasure, our dear W. B. N. was at home on furlough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Here we see nothing of war, except the uniform of the furloughed soldiers and the retrenchment in the style of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>Desserts and wine are abolished; all superfluities must go to the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>In some respects we are beginning to feel the blockade; groceries <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> are becoming scarce and high in price, but the ladies are becoming wonderfully ingenious-coffee is so judiciously blended with parched corn, wheat or rye, that you scarcely detect the adulteration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>The dressy Southern girls are giving up their handsome bonnets, wrappings, and silk dresses; they are perfectly willing to give up what once they considered absolutely necessary to their wardrobes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>They say they do not enjoy such things now; they are, however, bright and cheerful; they sing patriotic songs to their furloughed friends, and listen with undying interest to anecdotes of the battle-field, with tears for the fallen, sympathy for the wounded, and the most enthusiastic admiration for deeds of daring, or for the patient endurance of the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>It is delightful to see the unanimity of feeling, the oneness of heart, which pervades <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> at this time; and we believe it is so throughout the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>We were, however, soon saddened by a letter from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, from a comrade of our dear <persName n="Phelps,,Willie,,," id="n0028.0003.00082.00166" reg="default:Phelps,Willie,,,"><foreName>Willie</foreName> <surname>Phelps</surname></persName> to my brother, saying that the wound was more severe than it was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>He immediately set out for <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, but none of us dreamed of real danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>The reports came from him less and less favourable; I wanted to go to him, but the letters were discouraging to me-<quote>There was no room for me; ladies would be in the way in so small a hospital;</quote> and some strange hallucination and blindness to danger led us to abandon the idea of going to him. We knew that he had lost his arm, but did not dream of danger to his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>His mother, at her home in <placeName reg="Covington, Kenton, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014762">Covington, Kentucky</placeName>, saw his name among the wounded, and notwithstanding the cold and ice, set off alone-came through <placeName reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013927">Pittsburg</placeName> and to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> without difficulty, thence to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; but there no passport could be obtained to come to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 6" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>Early in the morning it was whispered about that some great movement was on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1710"/>The enemy's pickets were just across the river, and the men supposed they were in heavy force of infantry and artillery, and that the passage of the bridge would be hazardous in the extreme; yet their courage did not falter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1711"/>The gallant <num value="40" type="ordinal">Fortieth</num>, followed by <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n0028.0003.00123.00283" reg="mostcommon:Pegram,John,,,:1"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, rushed across the bridge at double-quick, and with exultant shouts drove the enemy's pickets from their posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1712"/>The enemy was driven rapidly down the river to <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, where the battle raged long and fiercely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1713"/>At <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> all was quiet; the bloody straggle over for the day. Our victory is said to be glorious, but not complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1714"/>The fighting is even now renewed, for I hear the firing of <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1715"/>Last night our streets were thronged until a late hour to catch the last accounts from couriers and spectators returning from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1718"/>The calmness of the people during the progress of the battle was marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1719"/>The balloons of the enemy hovering over the battle-field could be distinctly seen from the outskirts of the city, and the sound of musketry as distinctly heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1720"/>All were anxious, but none alarmed for the safety of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1721"/>From the firing of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun till the close of the battle every spot favourable for observation was crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1722"/>The tops of the <rs>Exchange</rs>, the <rs type="place">Ballard House</rs>, the <rs>Capitol</rs>, and almost every other tall house were covered with human <pb id="p.124" n="124"/> beings; and after nightfall the commanding hills from the <rs type="place">President's house</rs> to the <rs type="place">Alms-House</rs> were covered, like a vast amphitheatre, with men, women and children, witnessing the grand display of fireworks-beautiful, yet awful-and sending death amid those whom our hearts hold so dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1723"/>I am told (for I did not witness it) that it was a scene of unsurpassed magnificence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1724"/>The brilliant light of bombs bursting in the air and passing to the ground, the innumerable lesser lights, emitted by <num value="1000">thousands</num> and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of muskets, together with the roar of artillery and the rattling of small-arms, constituted a scene terrifically grand and imposing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1726"/>Is their trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and in the valour of our troops, so great that they are unmoved by these terrible demonstrations of our powerful foe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1727"/>It would seem so, for when the battle was over the crowd dispersed and retired to their respective homes with the seeming tranquility of persons who had been witnessing a panorama of transactions in a far-off country, in which they felt no personal interest; though they knew that their countrymen slept on their arms, only awaiting the dawn to renew the deadly conflict, on the success of which depended not only the fate of our capital, but of that splendid army, containing the material on which our happiness depends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1728"/>Ah! many full, sorrowful hearts were at home, breathing out prayers for our success; or else were busy in the hospitals, administering to the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1729"/>Those on the hill-sides and house-tops were too nervous and anxious to stay at home &mdash; not that they were apprehensive for the city, but for the fate of those who were defending it, and their feeling was too deep for expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>She had determined to remain, but when, on the night of the bombardment, a shell burst very near her house, her husband aroused her to say that she must go. They had no means of conveyance, and her <num value="2">two</num> children were both under <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of age, and but <num value="1">one</num> servant, (the others having gone to the <rs>Yankees</rs>,) a girl <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> old. It so happened that they had access to <num value="3">three</num> straw carriages, used by her own children and those of her neighbours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>They quickly determined to put a child in each of <num value="2">two</num> carriages, and to bundle up as many clothes as would fill the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3056"/>The father drew the carriage containing <num value="1">one</num> child, the mother the other child, and the little girl drew the bundle of clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>They thus set out, to go they knew not whither, only to get out of the way of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3058"/>It was about midnight, a dark, cold night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>They went on and on, to the outskirts of the town, encountering a confused multitude rushing pell-mell, with ever and anon a shell bursting at no great distance, sent as a threat of what they might expect on the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3060"/>They were presently overtaken by a respectable shoemaker whom they knew, rolling a wheelbarrow containing a large bundle of clothes, and <hi rend="italics">the baby</hi>. They were attracted by the poor little child rolling off from its elevated place on the bundle, and as <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D. stopped, with motherly solicitude for the child, the poor man told his story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3061"/>In the darkness and confusion he had become <pb id="p.221" n="221"/> separated from his wife and other children, and knew not where to find them; he thought he might find them but for anxiety about the baby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3062"/><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D. then proposed that he should take her bundle of clothes with his in the wheelbarrow, and put his child into the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> straw carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3063"/>This being agreed to, the party passed on. When they came to our encampment, a soldier ran out to offer to draw <num value="1">one</num> carriage, and thus rest the mother; having gone as far as he dared from his regiment, then another soldier took his place to the end of his line, and so on from <num value="1">one</num> soldier to another until our encampment was passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>Then she drew on her little charge about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> farther, to the house of an acquaintance, which was wide open to the homeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>Until late the next day the shoemaker's baby was under their care, but he at last came, bringing the bundle in safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>As the day progressed the cannon roared and the shells whistled, and it was thought advisable for them to go on to <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>The journey of several miles was performed on foot, still with the straw carriages, for no horse nor vehicle could be found in that desolated country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4122"/>We must give up our rooms by the last of this month, and the question now arises about our future abode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4123"/>We are searching hither and thither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4124"/>We had <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> thought for a week past that our arrangements were most delightfully made, and that we had procured, together with <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> M. and <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> G., <num value="6">six</num> rooms in a house on <address><street n="Franklin Street">Franklin Street</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4125"/>The M's and ourselves were to take <num value="4">four</num> rooms in the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story; the back parlour on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> floor was to be used by all parties; and <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> G. would take the large front basement room as his chamber, and at his request, as our dining-room, as we could not be allowed to use the upper chambers as eating-rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4126"/>Our large screen was to be transferred to the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s bedstead and washing apparatus, and the rest of the room furnished in dining-room style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4127"/>These rooms are all furnished and carpeted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4128"/>Nothing could have suited us better, and we have been for some days anticipating our comfortable winter-quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4129"/>The M's have left town with the blissful assurance of a nice home; to add to it all, the family of the proprietor is all that we could desire as friends and companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4130"/>Last night I met with a friend, who asked me where we had obtained rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4131"/>I described them with great alacrity and pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4132"/>She looked surprised, and said, <quote>Are you not mistaken?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4134"/><quote>Impossible,</quote> said I; <quote>we have engaged them.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4136"/>None but persons situated exactly in the same way can imagine our disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4137"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> looked aghast; <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>pro-nounced it a mistake; the girls were indignant, and I went a little farther, and pronounced it bad treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4138"/>This morning I went up before breakfast to hear the truth of the story &mdash; the family is still absent, but the servants confirmed the statement by saying that a family had been in <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> the rooms that we looked at for a week, and that a gentleman, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> party, had been up the day before to claim the rooms, and said that the party occupying them had no right to them, and must be turned out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4139"/>All this seems passing strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4143"/>We have this evening been out again in pursuit of quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4144"/>The advertisements of <quote>Rooms to let</quote> were sprinkled over the morning papers, so that <num value="1">one</num> could scarcely believe that there would be any difficulty in our being supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4145"/>A small house that would accommodate our whole party, <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> rooms in a large house, or <num value="2">two</num> rooms for ourselves, if it were impossible to do better, would answer our purpose-any thing for a comfortable home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4146"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> advertisement alluded to basement rooms-damp, and redolent of rheumatism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4147"/>The next was more attractive-good rooms, well furnished, and up <hi rend="italics">but <num value="2">two</num></hi> flights of stairs; but the price was enormous, far beyond the means of any of the party, and so evidently an extortion designed to take all that could be extracted from the necessity of others, that we turned from our hardfeatured proprietor with disgust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4148"/>The rooms of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> advertisement had been already rented, and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> seemed more like answering our purpose than any we had <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4149"/>There were only <num value="2">two</num> rooms, and though small, and rather dark, yet persons whose shelter was likely to be the <quote>blue vault of heaven</quote> could not be very particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4150"/>The price, too, was exorbitant, but with a little more self-denial it might be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4151"/>The next inquiry was about kitchen, servant's room and coal-house; but we got no further than the answer about the kitchen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4152"/>The lady said there was no kitchen that we could possibly use; her stove was small, and she required it all; we must either be supplied from a restaurant, or do our own cooking in <num value="1">one</num> of the rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4153"/>As neither plan was to be thought of, we ended the parley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4154"/>A <hi rend="italics">part of a kitchen</hi> is indispensable, though perhaps the most annoying thing to which refugees are subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4155"/>The mistress is generally polite enough, but save me from the selfsufficient cook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4156"/><quote>I would like to oblige you, madam, but you can't have loaf-bread to-morrow morning, because my mistress has ordered loaf-bread and rolls, and our stove is small;</quote> or, <quote>No, madam, you can't <q direct="unspecified"> <hi rend="italics">bile</hi></q> a ham, nor nothing else to-day, because it is our washing-day;</quote> or, <quote>No, ma'am, you can't have biscuits for tea, because the stove is cold, and I've got no time to heat it.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4157"/>So that we must either submit, or go to the mistress for redress, and probably find none, and thus run the risk of offending both mistress and maid, both of whom have us very much in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4158"/>As I walked home from this unsuccessful effort, it was nearly dark; the gas was being lighted in hall, parlour, and chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4159"/>I looked in as I passed, and saw cheerful countenances collecting around centre-tables, or sitting here and there on handsome porticoes or marble steps, to enjoy the cool evening breeze-countenances of those whose families I had known from infancy, and who were still numbered among my friends and acquaintances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4160"/>I felt sad, and asked myself, <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> if those persons could realize the wants of others, would they not cheerfully rent some of their extra rooms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4161"/>Rooms once opened on grand occasions, and now, as such occasions are few and far between, not opened at all for weeks and months together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>Would they not cheerfully remove some of their showy and fragile furniture for a time, and allow those who had once been accustomed to as large rooms of their own, to occupy and take care of them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4163"/>The <hi rend="italics">rent</hi> would perhaps be no object with them, but their kindness might be twice blessed &mdash; the refugees would be made comfortable and happy, and the money might be applied to the wants of the soldiers or the city poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4164"/>And yet <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> blessing might be added &mdash; the luxury of doing good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4165"/>Ah, they would then find that the <quote>quality of mercy is not strained,</quote> but that it would indeed, like the <quote>gentle dew from heaven,</quote> fall into their very souls, and diffuse a happiness of which they know not. These thoughts filled my mind until I reached the present home of a refugee friend from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4166"/>It was very late, but I thought I would run in, and see if she could throw any light upon our difficulties, I was sorry to find that she was in a similar situation, her husband having that day been notified that their rooms would be required on the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4167"/>We compared notes of our roomhunting experiences, and soon found ourselves laughing heartily over occurrences and conversations which were both provoking and ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4168"/>I then wended my way home, amid brilliantly lighted houses and badly lighted streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4169"/>Squads of soldiers were sauntering along, impregnating the <hi rend="italics">air</hi> with tobacco-smoke; men were standing at every corner, lamenting the fill of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> or the untimely end of <persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n0028.0034.00302.00784" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,Jack,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4175"/>This may all be true, but it is very distressing to hear it harped upon now; quite as much so as it was <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> ago to hear the <rs>President</rs> called obstinate, because he was ruining the country by not removing General J.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>He was educated at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, but in early life resigned his position in the regular army and joined a company of fur traders, went with them to the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs>, where he led an adventurous life, well suited to his excitable temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>For years his life was full of adventure, with the broad heavens for his roof and the cold earth for his couch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>With a bold spirit and great muscular power, he soon acquired extensive influence with the <rs>Indian</rs> tribes among which he moved, and was chosen as the chief of <num value="1">one</num> of them, where he was known as the <quote>Big warrior.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>As such he led his braves to many a hard-fought battle, and taught surrounding tribes to fear him and them, by such courage and prowess as always so deeply impress the savage mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>Many incidents of his life among the <name>Indians</name> are full of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4375"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, having received an injury from a neighbouring tribe, he sent to them that he was coming to settle with them for it, and that they must meet him for the purpose, at a certain time and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4376"/>Accordingly, all their warriors were assembled and seated in due form, at the proper distance <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> from and around a central post, ready and waiting for the conference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4377"/>At the appointed time, the <quote>Big warrior,</quote> in full dress, made his appearance, and striding through to the centre of the dark, silent circle, he struck his tomahawk deep into the <quote>post,</quote> and looking quietly but sternly around from <num value="1">one</num> gloomy warrior to another, he in few words told them why he was there, and what he required of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4379"/>His imposing appearance, his boldness, the justice of his cause, and his steady purpose of retaliating to the full, so awed them, that his terms were promptly assented to, and he quickly returned to his people with the most ample satisfaction for the injuries they had received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4380"/>He grew weary of this life after some years, and determined to return to his early home and associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4381"/>Acting upon this impulse, we next find him in <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName>, <placeName reg="Hampshire, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002265">Hampshire County</placeName>, among his kindred, where he quietly resumed the duties of civilized life, was married, and practised law for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4382"/>Still restless and different from other men, he was constantly speculating in <num value="1">one</num> thing and another-politics, property, etc. At <num value="1">one</num> time he was in the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName>, and controlled the vote of his county in a way new to our republican experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4383"/>For this purpose he got possession of a large mountain region, filling it with a population whom he ruled very much as a Scottish chief would have done in his ancestral Highlands, and using their votes to decide any public controversy in which he chose to engage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4384"/>This, of course, did not last long; it was too much opposed to the public views and feelings, and under the consequent changes around him, <pb id="p.320" n="320"/> he found it expedient to return to private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4385"/>From this retirement, however, his native State soon recalled him, as <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> commissioners to settle the boundary line between <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4386"/>In his capacity as such, the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName> sent him to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to examine the public records bearing upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4387"/>He discharged the duties of his mission with ability and success, as his voluminous report will show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4388"/>The present war found him residing with his large family near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, his native place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4389"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> having given him the commission of a colonel, it was hoped that he would be of great use in the bloody contest; but a discipline better suited in its severity to <name>Indian</name> warriors than to our highminded volunteers, together with advanced years and declining health, disappointed the expectations of himself and his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4390"/>He found, indeed, that bodily infirmity alone rendered him unfit for active service, and this, with other difficulties, made it proper to break up his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4391"/>Thus it happened that when that brute, <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n0028.0034.00320.00865" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, marched through <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, spreading desolation in his path, <persName n="McDonald,Colonel,,,," id="n0028.0034.00320.00866" reg="nearbymention:McDonald,Angus,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>McDonald</surname></persName>, then a resident of the town, believing that the enemy, who had manifested great harshness towards him, injuring his property near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, etc., would arrest him, determined to keep out of their way, and with others took refuge in a neighbouring forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4392"/>Here, unfortunately, the enemy found him, with his son <persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName>, a youth of some <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure>, and took them prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4393"/>It is somewhat singular that the presence of this devoted son caused the father's arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4394"/>He had always determined that he would never surrender, never be taken alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4395"/>But when he looked at this boy, who had fought so nobly by his side, and who would surely be sacrificed if he refused to <pb id="p.321" n="321"/> surrender, he could fight no longer; it seemed to nim, as he afterwards said, as the voice from Heaven which stayed the armed hand of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>, and he could not fire another shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4396"/>Father and son were thus captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4397"/><persName><foreName>Harry</foreName></persName> escaped in a day or <num value="2">two</num>; but the father was tied and dragged along at a rapid pace towards the <placeName key="tgn,7007516" n="1.000 22" reg="maryland">Maryland</placeName> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4398"/>When he could no longer walk a step, they allowed him to get into a wagon with nothing to rest upon but some old iron, rough tools, etc. Thus they hastened him to <placeName reg="Cumberland, Alleghany, Maryland" key="tgn,2046811">Cumberland, Maryland</placeName>, where they handcuffed him and put him into solitary confinement; thence he was hurried to <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>, where he was again, with his manacles on, shut up in a dungeon, <measure n="7feet" type="distance">seven feet</measure> by <num value="10">ten</num>, with nothing to relieve the sufferings incident to such a fate, nothing to expect or hope for, but the bitterest cruelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4399"/>From this dreadful captivity he was released <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> ago, and reached the house of his daughter, in this city, with health, bad for years, now worse than ever, and constitution entirely broken by hard and cruel bondage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4400"/>Cheered by freedom, and the society of his children who were here, he flattered himself that he would be enabled to return to his home of refuge in <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4401"/>This hope proved delusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4402"/>It soon appeared that his whole nervous system was shattered, and his end rapidly approaching; his wife was sent for, but did not arrive until the day after he died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4403"/>Not dreaming of what awaited her, she came full of hope and joy at the anticipated meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4404"/>But who may describe the grief which overwhelmed her on her arrival?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4405"/>His checkered life was closed in his <num value="66" type="ordinal">sixty-sixth</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4406"/>The funeral took place this evening at <placeName reg="St. Paul's Church">St. Paul's Church</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>He got well, and returned to his post, but was soon sent back again, too sick for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>The climate did not suit him, and when he again recovered <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> T. employed him as gardener and marketman to her hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4551"/>We all became interested in him, because of his quiet, subdued manner, faithfulness to his duty, and respectful bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>Some months ago his health began to decline, and day after day he has been watched and cared for by the surgeon and ladies with deep interest; but he steadily declines in strength, and is now confined to his cot, and it is but too evident that his end is approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>We had all remarked that he never alluded to his early history, and was singularly reserved with regard to his religious faith; yet, as long as he was able to go out, he might be seen every Sunday seated alone in a corner of the gallery of <orgName n="St.James Church" type="church">St. James's Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4593"/>When we got home my mother collected her friends and neighbours to make my clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4594"/>She and my sisters looked sorry enough, but not a word did they say about it. I knew that my father had told them not to do it, and my heart was too full to speak to anybody except to Mary Dare-she knew that as soon as I could come for her that I would come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/> Agitated and nervous, I turn to my diary to-night as the means of soothing my feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>We have <pb id="p.343" n="343"/> passed through a fatal <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>. Yesterday morning (it seems a week ago) we went, as usual, to <orgName n="St.James Church" type="church">St. James's Church</orgName>, hoping for a day of peace and quietness, as well as of religious improvement and enjoyment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>How short-sighted we are, and how little do we know of what is coming, either of judgment or mercy The sermon being over, as it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Sunday in the month, the sacrament of the <rs>Lord</rs>'s Supper was administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>The day was bright, beautiful, and peaceful, and a general quietness and repose seemed to rest upon the congregation, undisturbed by rumours and apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>While the sacred elements were being administered, the sexton came in with a note to <persName n="Cooper,General,,,," id="n0028.0035.00343.00908" reg="mostcommon:Cooper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cooper</surname></persName>, which was handed him as he walked from the chancel, and he immediately left the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>It made me anxious; but such things are not uncommon, and caused no excitement in the congregation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>The services being over, we left the church, and as the congregations from the various churches were being mingled on <address><street n="Grace Street">Grace Street</street></address>, our children, who had been at <placeName key="tgn,7013947" n="1.000 10" reg="saint paul, ramsey, minnesota">St. Paul</placeName>'s, joined us, on their way to the usual family gathering in our room on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

Not until then did I observe that every countenance was wild with excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>The inquiry, <quote>What is the matter?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>ran from lip to lip. Nobody seemed to hear or to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>An old friend ran across the street, pale with excitement, repeating what J. had just told us, that unless we heard better news from <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0028.0035.00343.00910" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitz,,,:6"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> the city would be evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/>Then we began to understand that the <rs>Government</rs> was moving, and that the evacuation was indeed going on. The officehold-ers were now making arrangements to get off. Every car was ordered to be ready to take them south.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>Baggagewagons, carts, drays, and ambulances were driving about the streets; every <num value="1">one</num> was going off that could go, and now there were all the indications of alarm and excitement of every kind which could attend such an awful scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>The people were rushing up and down the streets, vehicles of all kinds were flying along, bearing goods of all sorts and people of all ages and classes who could go beyond the corporation lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>We tried to keep ourselves quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>We could not go south, nor could we leave the city at all in this hurried way. J. and his wife had gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>The public offices were all forsaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>They said that by <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the morning the work must be completed, and the city ready for the enemy to take possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>Oh, who shall tell the horror of the past night!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>Hope seemed to fade; none but despairing words were heard, except from a few brave hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>Union men began to show themselves; treason walked abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>A gloomy pall seemed to hang over us; but I do not think that any of us felt keenly, or have yet realized our overwhelming calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>The suddenness and extent of it is too great for us to feel its poignancy at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>About <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> in the morning we were startled by a loud sound like thunder; the house shook and the windows rattled; it seemed like an earthquake in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>We knew not what it was, nor did we care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>It was soon understood to be the blowing up of a magazine below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/>It was then daylight, and we were standing out upon the pavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> and B. had just gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>Shall we ever meet again?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>Many ladies were now upon the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>The lower part of the city was burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>About <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> I set off to go to the central depot to see if the cars would go out.

I went on and on towards the depot, and as I proceeded shouts and screams became louder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>The rabble <pb id="p.346" n="346"/> rushed by me in <num value="1">one</num> stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>At last I exclaimed, <quote>Who are those shouting?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>What is the matter?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>I seemed to be answered by a <num value="100">hundred</num> voices, <quote>The <rs>Yankees</rs> have come.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>I turned to come home, but what was my horror, when I reached <address><street n="9 Street">Ninth Street</street></address>, to see a regiment of <name>Yankee</name> cavalry come dashing up, yelling, shouting, hallooing, screaming All Bedlam let loose could not have vied with them in diabolical roarings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>I stood riveted to the spot; I could not move nor speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>Then I saw the iron gates of our time-honoured and beautiful <address><street n="Capitol Square">Capitol Square</street></address>, on the walks and greensward of which no hoof had been allowed to tread, thrown open and the cavalry dash in. I could see no more; I must go on with a mighty effort, or faint where I stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>I came home amid what I thought was the firing of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4701"/>I thought that they were thundering forth a salute that they had reached the goal of their ardent desires; but I afterwards found that the <rs type="place">Armory</rs> was on fire, and that the flames having reached the shells deposited there for our army, they were exploding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4702"/>These explosions were kept up until a late hour this evening; I am rejoiced they are gone; they, at least, can never be turned against us. I found the family collected around the breakfast-table, and was glad to see <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> M's family with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4703"/>The captain has gone, and the ladies have left their home on <quote><placeName key="possibilities=53" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Union Hill</placeName></quote> to stay here among friends, <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> P. having kindly given them rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4704"/>An hour or <num value="2">two</num> after breakfast we all retired to our rooms exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4705"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had slept; no <num value="1">one</num> had sought repose or thought of their own comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4706"/>The Federal soldiers were roaming about the streets; either whiskey or the excess of joy had given some of them the appearance of being beside themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4707"/>We had hoped that very little whiskey would be found in the <pb id="p.347" n="347"/> city, as, by order of the <rs>Mayor</rs>, casks were emptied yesterday evening in the streets, and it flowed like water through the gutters; but the rabble had managed to find it secreted in the burning shops, and bore it away in pitchers and buckets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4708"/>It soon became evident that protection would be necessary for the residences, and at the request of <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> P. I went to the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>'s office</orgName> to ask for it. <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> P. was unfortunately in the country, and only ladies were allowed to apply for guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4709"/>Of course this was a very unpleasant duty, but I must undertake it. <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D. agreed to accompany me, and we proceeded to the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName> &mdash; the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>, which from my childhood I had regarded with respect and reverence, as the place where my father had for years held his courts, and in which our lawyers, whose names stand among the highest in the <rs type="place">Temple of Fame</rs>, for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> expounded the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, which must now be trodden under foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4710"/>We reached it. After passing through crowds of negro soldiers there, we found on the steps some of the elderly gentlemen of the city seeking admittance, which was denied them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4711"/>I stopped to speak to <rs type="role">Mr.</rs>--, in whose commission house I was <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> ago, and saw him surrounded by all the stores which usually make up the establishment of such a merchant; it was now a mass of blackened ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4712"/>He had come to ask protection for his residence, but was not allowed to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4713"/>We passed the sentinel, and an officer escorted us to the room in which we were to ask our country's foe to allow us to remain undisturbed in our own houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4714"/><rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D. leant on me tremblingly; she shrank from the humiliating duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4715"/>For my own part, though my heart beat loudly and my blood boiled, I never felt more high-spirited or lofty than at that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4716"/>A large table was surrounded by officials, writing <pb id="p.348" n="348"/> or talking to the ladies, who came on the same mission that brought us. I approached the officer who sat at the head of the table, and asked him politely if he was the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>. <quote>I am the <name>Commandant</name>, madam,</quote> was the respectful reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4717"/><quote>Then to whom am I to apply for protection for our residence?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4718"/><quote>You need none, madam; our troops are perfectly disciplined, and dare not enter your premises.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4719"/><quote>I am sorry to be obliged to undeceive you, sir, but when I left home <num value="7">seven</num> of your soldiers were in the yard of the residence opposite to us, and <num value="1">one</num> has already been into our kitchen.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4720"/>He looked surprised, and said, <quote>Then, madam, you are entitled to a guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4722"/>This was quickly done, and as I turned to go out, I saw standing near me our old friend, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs>--. Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4723"/>how my heart sank when I looked into her calm, sad face, and remembered that she and her venerable and highly esteemed husband must ask leave to remain in peace in their home of many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4724"/>The next person who attracted my attention was that sweet young girl, <persName n="Having,,S.,W.,," id="n0028.0035.00348.00913" reg="default:Having,S.,W.,,"><foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Having</surname></persName> no mother, she of course must go and ask that her father's beautiful mansion may be allowed to stand uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4725"/>Tears rolled down her cheeks as she pressed my hand in passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4726"/>Other friends were there; we did not speak, we could not; we sadly looked at each other and passed on. <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D. and myself came out, accompanied by our guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4733"/>At any other moment it would have distracted me, but I had ceased to feel any thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4734"/>We brought our guard to <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> P., who posted him; about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> he came to tell me that the guard was drunk, and threatening to shoot the servants in the yard.
