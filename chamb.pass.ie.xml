<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Note.-The-narrative here presented is substantially complete, but the author's death prevented it from receiving the advantage of a final revision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The book has been prepared for the press under the supervision of his children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It now comes into publication just half a century after the period of the stirring events described. </p></div1>

<head>Introductory.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>History is written for the most part from the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Truth often suffers distortion by reason of the point of view of the narrator, some pre-occupation of his judgment or fancy not only as to relative merits but even as to facts in their real relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>An interior view may not be without some personal coloring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But it must be of interest, especially in important transactions, to know how things appeared to those actually engaged in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Action and passion on such a scale must bear some thoughts <quote>that run before and after.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It has been deemed a useful observance <quote>to see ourselves as others see us,</quote> but it may sometimes be conducive to a just comprehension of the truth to let others see us as we see ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The view here presented is of things as they appeared to us who were concerned with them as subordinate commanders,--having knowledge, however, of the general plan, and a share in the responsibility for its execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>This is a chapter of experiences,--including in this term not only what was done, but what was known and said and thought and felt,--not to say, suffered; and in its darkest passages showing a steadfast purpose, <pb id="p.xii" n="xii"/> patience, and spirit of obedience deserving of record even if too often without recompense, until the momentous consummation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>These memoirs are based on notes made nearly at the time of the events which they describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>They give what may be called an interior view of occurrences on the front of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName>, <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, during the last essay in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s Virginia campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This was so distinctive in character, conditions, and consequences, that I have ventured to entitle it <quote>The last campaign of the armies.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/></p> 
<p>I trust this narrative may not seem to arrogate too much for the merits of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>No eminence is claimed for it beyond others in that campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But the circumstance that this Corps was assigned to an active part with <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Phil,,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> during the period chiefly in view &mdash; the envelopment and final out-flanking of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> warrants the prominence given in this review. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It may be permitted to hope that this simple recital may throw some light on a passage of the history of this Corps, the record of which has been obscured in consequence of the summary change of commanders early in the campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> had a certain severity of reputation quite distinctive in the comradeship of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Early in its history, <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Fitz-John,,,:2"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName> &mdash; the nucleus of it-had drawn the especial praise of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> for its soldierly bearing and proficiency, being unfortunately referred to in orders as a model for the rest of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>This <pb id="p.xiii" n="xiii"/> had the effect of creating on the part of others a feeling of jealousy towards that Division or an opposition to apparent favoritism shown its commander, which was extended to the whole Corps on its formation in the summer of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, when the <name>Regulars</name> were assigned to it as its <orgName type="division" n="Division 2">Second Division</orgName>, and the choice <orgName type="mil" key="PAReserves">Pennsylvania Reserves</orgName> became its <orgName type="division" n="Division 3">Third Division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>This feeling certainly was neither caused nor followed by anything like boastfulness or self-complacency on the part of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName>; but, if anything, created a sense of responsibility and willingness to <quote>endure hardness as good soldiers</quote> to make good their reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>And no doubt the discipline of the <rs>Corps</rs> was quite severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Most of its commanding officers in the superior grades were West Pointers, and experienced officers of the old army, and prided themselves on strict observance of Army Regulations and military habitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The required personal relations between officers and men were quite novel and but slowly acquiesced in by volunteers who were firstclass citizens at home,--many of them equal to their official <quote>superiors.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>For example: my young brother, <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>, when a private in my regiment came sometimes to see me in my tent, but would not think of sitting down in my presence unless specially invited to do so. But he went home from <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs> of his regiment and <rs type="role" reg="Brevet-Colonel">Brevet-Colonel</rs> of <orgName type="mil" key="USVolunteer">United States Volunteers</orgName>--and this on his own merits, not through any suggestion of mine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Passages in the history of the <rs>Corps</rs> had endeared <pb id="p.xiv" n="xiv"/> its members to each other, and brought out soldierly pride and manly character; but boastful assertion and just glorification of their Corps were remarkably less manifest among its members than with those of every <num value="1">one</num> of the other splendid Corps of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It may not be improper to state here that there was a manifest prejudice against the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> at Government Headquarters,--particularly at <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,John,,,:2"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s,--on account of the supposed attachment for <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Fitz-John,,,:2"><surname>Porter</surname></persName> among its members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>This was believed to be the reason why no promotion to the rank of <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">General Officers</rs> was made in this Corps for a long time, unless secured by political influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Brigades and even divisions were in many cases commanded by colonels of State regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>This worked a great injustice in the fact that officers of similar commands in the different Corps were not of similar relative rank, and some were therefore unduly subordinated to those who were not in fact their superiors in service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>There was also a practical injustice in the added expense of supporting headquarters above lineal rank, which, with no extra pay or allowance, quite cancelled the compliment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It had not been the habit in the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> to encourage detailed reports on the part of subordinates, and in the rush and pressure of this last campaign there was less opportunity or care than ever for such matters, and the impressiveness of its momentous close left little disposition to multiply words upon subordinate parts or participants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><pb id="p.xv" n="xv"/> The fact also of an early and sudden change in the grand tactics of the campaign confused the significance and sometimes the identity of important movements; and the change of commanders in the crisis of its most important battle induced consequences which, even in official reports and testimony afterwards called for, affected the motive in sharply defining actions where personal concern had come to be an embarrassing factor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Very naturally, the immediate reports of those days are meager in the extreme; and very much of what has come out since, partaking of official character, has been under the disadvantage of being elicited as <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> testimony before military tribunals where the highest military officers of the <rs>Government</rs> were parties, and the attitudes of plaintiff and defendant almost inevitably biased expression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>In the strange lull after the surrender of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0002.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and the sudden release from intense action and responsibility, but as yet in the field and in the active habit not readily relinquished, it occurred to me, impressed with the deep-wrought visions of those tragic days, to write down, while fresh in mind and mood, some salient facts of that last campaign, within my personal knowledge and observation, to serve for fireside memories in after years, and for the satisfaction of some others who had given of their best for the great issues in which these scenes were involved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>It has been suggested to me of late that these reminiscences might be of interest to a wider circle <pb id="p.xvi" n="xvi"/> whose hearts respond to the story of things done and suffered for truth and honor's sake, which they would have gladly shared in their own persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>In preparing for this more exacting demand I have availed myself of additional material which, in the later consolidations in the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName>, successive assignments brought into my hands: particularly the office-copy of the <rs>Corps</rs> field-orders for the last campaign, and also the invaluable original records of the <rs type="role" reg="Medical-Inspector">Medical Inspector</rs> of the <rs>Corps</rs> for that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Later, came the (now suppressed) volumes of the records of the <rs>Warren</rs> <orgName n="Inquiry Court" type="court">Court of Inquiry</orgName>, and the extensive <hi rend="italics">Records of the <rs>War</rs> of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>.</hi> In revising this personal memoir, I have diligently consulted these, but have found no occasion to correct or modify the account given from my own point of view, however limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Qualifying or corroborative testimony from these sources, when introduced, has been clearly indicated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>I confess some embarrassments of a personal nature in giving forth certain passages of this record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>These facts, however simply stated, cannot but have some bearing on points which have been drawn into controversy on the part of persons who were dear to me as commanders and companions in arms, and who have grown still dearer in the intimacies of friendship since the war. Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>that no <num value="1">one</num> of them can answer my greeting across the bar. I feel therefore under increased responsibility in recounting these things, but assure myself that I know of no demand of personality or partisanship which should make me <pb id="p.xvii" n="xvii"/> doubtful of my ability to tell the truth as I saw and knew it, or distrust my judgment in forming an opinion.</p>

<head>Chapter <num type="roman" value="1" n="I"><num value="1">1</num></num>: the situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It was a dreamy camp along the lines investing <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> in the winter following the <quote>all-summer</quote> campaign of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>,--that never-to-be-forgotten, most dismal of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Although shadowed at the very beginning by melancholy tokens of futile endeavor and grievous losses,--consolidations of commands which obliterated the place and name of proud and beloved corps and divisions,flags made sacred by heroic service and sacrifice of noble manhood now folded away with tender reverence, or perhaps by special favor permitted to be borne beside those of new assignments, bearing the commanding presence of great memories, pledge and talisman of unswerving loyalty, though striking sorrow to every heart that knew their history,--yet this seemed not to make for weakness but rather for settled strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We started out full of faith and hope under the new dispensation, resolved at all events to be worthy of our past and place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/><pb id="p.2" n="2"/> </p> 
<p>Now all was over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The summer had passed, and the harvest was but of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>New and closer consolidations, more dreary obliterations, brought the survivors nearer together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>For this dismal year had witnessed that ever repeated, prolific miracle,--the invisible, ethereal soul of man resisting and overcoming the material forces of nature; scorning the inductions of logic, reason, and experience, persisting in its purpose and identity; this elusive apparition between <num value="2">two</num> worlds unknown, deemed by some to be but the chance product of intersecting vortices of atoms and denied to be even a force, yet outfacing the solid facts of matter and time, defying disaster and dissolution, and, by a most real metempsychosis, transmitting its imperishable purpose to other hearts with the cumulative courage of immortal energies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Give but the regard of a glance to the baldest outline of what was offered and suffered, given and taken, lost and held, in that year of tragedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>That long-drawn, <hi rend="italics">tete baissee</hi> (bull-headed), zig-zag race from the <rs>Rapidan</rs> to the <rs>Appomattox</rs>; that desperate, inch-worm advance along a front of fire, with writhing recoil at every touch; that reiterated dissolving view of death and resurrection: the <rs>Wilderness</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,2114316" n="1.000 8" reg="spotsylvania, spotsylvania, virginia">Spottsylvania</placeName>, the <rs>North Anna</rs>, <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>, <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>; unspoken, unspeakable history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Call back that roseate <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> morning, all the springs of life athrill, that youthful army pressing the bridges of the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, flower of Northern homes, <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num>; tested <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> in valor, disciplined by experience, hearts swelling with manly courage, confident trust, and supreme devotion,--to be plunged straightway into hell-like horrors; the murderous maze where desperate instinct replaced impossible tactics; men mowing each other down almost at hand-reach, invisible each to each till the flaming muzzles cut lurid windows through the matted brush and bramble walls, and underneath the darkened woods low-lying cannon and bursting shells set the earth itself on fire, and wrapped in winding sheets of flame unnumbered, thick-strewn bodies of dead and dying, never to be found or known on earth again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Then the rushing, forced flank-movements, known and overmatched by the ever alert enemy; followed by reckless front attacks, where highest valor was deepest loss; buffetings on bloody angles; butcherings in slaughter pens,--all the way down to the fateful <rs>Chickahominy</rs> once more &mdash; a campaign under fire for <measure n="27days" type="date">twenty-seven days</measure> and nights together; morning reports at last not called for, and when we asked explanation our superiors answered,--confidentially, lest it seem disloyal: <quote>Because the country would not stand it, if they knew.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/></p> 
<p>What wonder that men who have passed through such things together,--no matter on which side arrayed,--should be wrought upon by that strange power of a common suffering which so divinely passes into the power of a common love. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>A similar fate befell the new hope kindled by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00003.00046" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s sudden change to a new base of operations,--a movement bold if not hazardous, being <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> practically a change of front under fire for the whole army on a grand scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Skillfully withdrawing from the enemy's front by secret orders and forced marches, swiftly crossing the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> on transports and pontoons, hurrying forward to strike a surprise on weakly-defended <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and thus cut <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00004.00047" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s main communications and turn his entire position-seemed good generalship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>But the bold plan and generous following stultified by confusion of understandings and supine delays of subordinates, brought all to nought once more with terrible recoil and reckoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Then the long slow fever of profitless minor action and wasteful inaction, with the strange anomaly of a mutual siege; crouching in trenches, skulking under bombproofs and covered ways, lining parapets where to show a head was to lure a bullet, picketing a crowded hostile front where the only tenure of life was the tacit understanding of a common humanity, perpetual harassing by spasmodic raid or futile dash, slow creepings flankward yet never nearer the main objective;--such was the wearisome, wearing experience, month after month, the new year bringing no sign nor hope that anything better could be done on that line than had been so dearly and vainly tried before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The resultant mood of such a front was not relieved by what reached us from the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The long-suffering, and helpless grief of homes; the sore-tried faith and patience of the whole <rs>North</rs> almost faltering; recruiting disenchanted, supplemented by enormous bounties and finally by <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> draft and conscription; newspapers jeering at the impotence of the army; self-seeking politicians at the <rs>Capitol</rs> plotting against the <rs>President</rs>; hosts of spoilsmen at all points seizing advantage of the country's distress, enriching themselves out of the generous, hard-earned offerings to meet her needs and repair her losses; cabal and favoritism in places of power, perpetrating a <num value="1000">thousand</num> injustices upon officers and soldiers in the field;--through all this, seen and known and felt, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, these men of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>,--godlike, if something short of sainthood,--this army, on which the heaviest brunt had fallen and was to fall, held up its heart where it could not hold up its head; with loyalty unswerving, obedience unquestioning, courage that asks not cheer, and devotion out-vying all that life holds dearest or death most terrible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This army-but what army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Is this identity a thing of substance, or spirit, or of name only?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Is this the army which bright as its colors thronged the bridges of the <rs>Rapidan</rs> on that <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> morning less than a year before, and vanished into the murk of the <rs>Wilderness</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Or is it scarcely the half of them; stern-faced by realities, saddened and perchance also strengthened by visions of the lost, the places of these filled by fresh youth's vicarious offering, united as <num value="1">one</num> by the comradeship of arms and strong with the contagion of soul? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But perhaps this vein of emotion is tiresome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Let us seek relief in figures,--which some people regard as the only reliable facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/><pb id="p.6" n="6"/> </p> 
<p>The number of men of all arms present for duty equipped in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> at the opening of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00006.00048" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s campaign, as shown by the consolidated morning reports of <dateStruct value="1864-05-04"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="4">4</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, was <num value="97162">97,162</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>He evidently takes the number as borne upon the rolls in his office, which by no means always agrees with the field lists of those present for duty equipped, the absent on leave or detail, or otherwise, being usually at a high percentage of the total.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The careful compilation of <persName n="Drum,Adjutant General,,,," id="n0010.0003.00006.00050" reg="mostcommon:Drum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</roleName> <surname>Drum</surname></persName> made from official field returns at this time gives the number present for duty equipped at <num value="97273">97,273</num>-in remarkable agreement with the figures taken in the field.<note anchored="yes" id="n.6.1">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>But to throw light on our present topic by <num value="1">one</num> more comparison, let us turn to the records of the <rs>Confederates</rs> for this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>According to the careful investigations of <persName n="Humphreys,General,,,," id="n0010.0003.00010.00058" reg="nearbymention:Humphreys,A.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>, the number of effective men in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00010.00059" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, including cavalry, at the opening of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00010.00060" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s campaign, was not less than <num value="62000">62,000</num>; and at the opening of the spring campaign of &lsquo;<num value="65">65</num>, not less than <num value="57000">57,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The accuracy of this is undoubted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The striking fact is thus established that we had more men killed and wounded in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00010.00061" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s campaign, than <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00010.00062" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> had at any <num value="1">one</num> period of it in his whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>I offer no apology for this long survey of figures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>There is abundant reason for it for the sake of fact, as well as occasion in existing sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Among other interesting reflections, these facts and figures afford useful suggestions to those easily persuaded persons of the <rs>South</rs> or elsewhere, who please themselves with asserting that our Western armies <quote>did all the fighting.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Lorgnettes will get out of order-especially to the cross-eyed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The aspect in which the men of our army have been presented has been mainly that of their elementary manhood, the antique virtues that made up valor: courage, fortitude, self-command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>It is not possible to separate these from other personal activities of perhaps higher range than the physical; because, in truth, these enter largely into the exercise and administration of manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It seems now to be an accepted maxim of war that the <quote>moral</quote> forces-meaning by that term what we call the spiritual, pertaining specially to the mind or soul-far outweigh the material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Few would now claim that <quote>victory is always with the heaviest battalions.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>All great contests are inspired by sentiments, such as justice, pity, faith, loyalty, love, or perhaps some stirring ideal of the rightful and possible good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Even the commoner instincts partake of this nature: self-respect, sanctity of the person, duty and affection towards others, obedience to law, the impulse to the redress of injury, vengeance for outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Something of this entered into our motive at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>But deeper tests brought deeper thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>In the strange <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> succession of reverses greater reaches were disclosed; sentiments took on their highest sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Our place in human brotherhood, our responsibility not only in duty for Country, but as part in its very being, came impressively into view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Our volunteer soldiers felt that they were part of the very people whose honor and life they were to maintain; they recognized that they were entitled to participate so far as they were able, in the thought and conscience and will of that supreme <quote>people</quote> whose agents and instruments they were in the field of arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>This recognition was emphasized by the fact that the men in the field were authorized to vote in the general election of <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and so to participate directly in the administration of the government and the determination of public policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The result of this vote showed how much stronger was their allegiance to principle than even their attachment to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00012.00066" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, whose personal popularity in the army was something marvelous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The men voted overwhelmingly for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00012.00067" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>They were unwilling that their long fight should be set down as a failure, even though thus far it seemed so. The fact that this war was in its reach of meaning and consequent effect so much more than what are commonly called <quote>civil wars,</quote> --this being a war to test and finally determine the character of the interior constitution and real organic life of this great people,--brought into the field an amount of thoughtfulness and moral reflection not usual in armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The <name>Roman</name> army <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> could make emperors of generals, but thoughtful minds and generous hearts were wanting to save <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> from the on-coming, invisible doom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>But volunteers like ours were held by a consciousness not only rooted in instinctive love and habitual reverence but also involving spiritual and moral considerations of the highest order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The motive under which they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sprung to the front was an impulse of sentiment,--the honor of the old flag and love of Country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>All that the former stood for, and all that the latter held undetermined, they did not stop to question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>They would settle the fact that they had a country and then consider the reasons and rights of it. There was, indeed, an instinctive apprehension of what was involved in this; but only slowly as the struggle thickened, and they found their antagonists claiming to rest their cause on principles similar to their own, they were led to think more deeply, to analyze their concrete ideals, to question, to debate, to test loyalty by thoughts of right and reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>We had opportunity to observe the relative merits of Regulars and Volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/><num value="2">Two</num> rather divergent opinions had been common as to the professional soldiers of the rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/><num value="1">One</num> was that they were of inferior grade as men; the other that they were vastly superior as soldiers to any volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>It must be allowed that the trained soldier has the merit of habitual submission to discipline, obedience to orders, a certain professional pride, and at least a temporary loyalty to the cause in which he is engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The superior efficiency of the regular <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> over the volunteer is generally asserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>But this is founded more on conditions than on character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>It derives its acceptance from the fact that volunteers are called out in an exigency, and take the field in haste, without experience or preparation, or even knowledge of the conditions pertaining to the art of war. They answer some call of the heart, or constraining moral obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>But these volunteers may in due time become skilled in all these requisites: discipline, obedience, and even practical knowledge of the many technicalities of the art of war. Such veterans may become quite the equals of regulars in the scale of military merit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>So, on the other hand, the regular may be as intelligent as the citizen soldier, and animated by motives as high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>As to the regular officers, there can be no question of their superior qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>They are educated for this profession, and specially in all that serves as basis for loyalty to country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>As to the rank and file of regular troops, history sometimes refers to them as mercenaries, workers for pay, and they have been stigmatized as <quote>hirelings.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>But this is abuse, even of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The word soldier does indeed mean the man paid for his service instead of being bound to serve by feudal obligation.<note anchored="yes" id="n.14.1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> 
<p>This pay was in the form of the <quote>soldi</quote> (from the <rs>Latin</rs> <quote>solidus</quote> ), the real money, the piece of solid metal, represented to-day in the <rs>French</rs> <quote>sou.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/></p></note> But no <num value="1">one</num> can despise such soldiers who remember the conduct of the <orgName n="Swiss Guard" type="guard">Swiss Guard</orgName> of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="16">XVI</genName></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>And we certainly held our regulars dear, from long association, and could only speak their name with honor when we thought of the desperate charge down from the <rs>Round Tops</rs> of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> into the maelstrom of death swirling around the <quote>Devil's Den,</quote> from which but half their numbers emerged, and these so wrought upon that they were soon after released from service in the field to recover strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>These veterans of ours were the equals of regulars even if they received a nominal pay; equals in discipline, in knowledge, skill, and valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>They were superior in that they represented the homes and ideals of the country, and not only knew what they were fighting for but also held it dear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The same tendency of thought and feeling was, no doubt, in the hearts of our adversaries, although their loyalty seems to have been held longer by the primal instincts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>This appeared not merely in the fervid exhortations of commanders and officials, but in the prevailing spirit of the men in the ranks, with whom we had occasional conference across the picket lines, or in brief interviews with prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The prime motive with these men was no doubt, like ours, grounded in the instincts of manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They sprang to arms for the vindication of what they had been accustomed to regard as their rights <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> by nature and law. By struggling and suffering for the cause this thought was rather intensified than broadened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>But in these lulls reflection began to enlarge vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>This matter of rights and duties presents itself, as it were, in concentric spheres, within which polarities are reversed as values rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The right to property must yield to the right to life; individual happiness must be subordinated to the general well-being; duty to country must outweigh all the narrower demands of self-interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>So the sight of <quote>the old flag,</quote> which stood for the guaranty of highest human rights, and which they were now striving to beat down in defeat and dishonor, must have affected their sober thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>There was no little evidence of this as the winter and the weary siege wore on. It came to our knowledge in the early months of the new year that heavy desertions were going on every day in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00016.00068" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>,--especially among the <name>Virginians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We had reason to believe that it was the personal magnetism of their great commander that kept alive the spirit of that brave army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The chivalrous sense of personal loyalty was strong with those men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Our acquaintance had been peculiarly intimate and deep, and we had for them a strong personal regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The <quote>causes</quote> were wide apart, but the manhood was the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>We had occasion to observe their religious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>More free thought and wider range of code no doubt prevailed in our Northern army; but what we are accustomed to call simple, personal piety was more manifest in <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> the <rs>Confederate</rs> ranks than in ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Not presuming to estimate the influence of particular cases of higher officers, like <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n0010.0003.00017.00069" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> or <persName n="Howard,General,,,," id="n0010.0003.00017.00070" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName>, making prominent their religious principles and proclivities, but fully recognizing the general religious character of most of the officers and men from our Northern homes, it must be admitted that the expression of religious sentiment and habit was more common and more earnest in the <rs>Confederate</rs> camp than in ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>In <num value="1">one</num> thing we took <quote>the touch of elbow.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It was no uncommon incident that from close opposing bivouacs and across hushed breastworks at evening voices of prayer from over the way would stir our hearts, and floating songs of love and praise be caught up and broadened into a mighty and thrilling chorus by our men softening down in cadences like enfolding wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/></p> 
<p>I have said the men kept up heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>So they did, --exactly that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It was a certain loyalty of soul, rather than persistence of vital energies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The experiences which had hardened the spiritual nerve, had relaxed the physical fiber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The direct effects of bodily over-strain reach to the nervous centers and the boundaries of spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Exhausting forced marches, through choking dust, burning suns, stifling heat even in the shade, swampy bivouacs, malarious airs laden with the off-castings of rotting vegetation, or worse at times, from innumerable bodies of men and animals dead or living; strange forms of sickness, unexampled and irremediable, <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> experiences borne only by stubborn patience or heroic pride,--such things tell at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Then the battles, horrible scenes, shocking the senses, burrowing in memory to live again in dreams and haunting visions, all these things together work upon the inner, vital, or spiritual forces which relate us to the real persistent substance-whether ethereal or of some yet finer form not yet dreamed of in our philosophy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>But men are made of mind and soul as well as body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>We deal not only with exercises of the senses, but with deeper consciousness; affections, beliefs, ideals, conceptions of causes and effects, relations and analogies, and even conjectures of a possible order and organization different from what we experience in the present world of sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>All these powers and workings have part in the makeup of manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Men are not machines; although it is said the discipline of army life tends to make them such, and that this is essential to their efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>A remark which needs to be set in larger light. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The men of the rank and file in our army of volunteers before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> besides being seasoned soldiers were endowed and susceptible according to their spiritual measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Their life was not merely in their own experiences but in larger sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Their environment, which is thought to determine character so largely, consisted for them not only in material things but also much in memories and shadowings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Things were remnants and reminders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Lines stood thinner; circles ever narrowing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Corps <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> fought down to divisions; divisions to brigades; these again broken and the shattered regiments consolidated under the token and auspices of their States,--as if reverting to their birthright, and being <quote>gathered to their fathers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Old flags,--yes, but crowded together not by on-rush to battle, but by thinning ranks bringing the dear more near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Then the vacant places of lost comrades, seen as <quote>an aching void</quote> both as to fact and suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>And even the coming in of new, fresh faces was not without its cast of shadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The officers, too, who had gone down were of the best known, trusted, and beloved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>What has gone takes something with it, and when this is of the dear, nothing can fill the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>All the changes touched the border of sorrows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The strength of great memories, pride of historic continuity, unfailing loyalty of purpose and resolve held these men together in unity of form and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But there seemed some slackening of the old nerve and verve; and service was sustained more from the habit of obedience and instinct of duty, than with that sympathetic intuition which inspires men to exceed the literal of orders or of obligations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Curious people often ask the question whether in battle we are not affected by fear, so that our actions are influenced by it; and some are prompt to answer, <quote>Yes, surely we are, and anybody who denies it is a braggart or a liar.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>I say to such, <quote>Speak for yourselves.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>A soldier has something else to think about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Most men at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, or at some tragic moment, are aware of the present peril, <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> and perhaps flinch a little by an instinct of nature and sometimes accept the foregoing confession,as when I have seen men pin their names to their breasts that they may not be buried unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>But any action following the motive of fear is rare, --for sometimes I have seen men rushing to the front in a terrific fire, <quote>to have it over with.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/></p> 
<p>But, as a rule, men stand up from <num value="1">one</num> motive or another-simple manhood, force of discipline, pride, love, or bond of comradeship-<quote>Here is Bill; I will go or stay where he does.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>And an officer is so absorbed by the sense of responsibility for his men, for his cause, or for the fight that the thought of personal peril has no place whatever in governing his actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The instinct to seek safety is overcome by the instinct of honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>There are exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>This is the rule and law of manhood: fearlessness in the face of all lesser issues because he has faced the greater-the commanding <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>This exposition of the state of mind and body among our officers and men in the later operations along the <rs type="place">Petersburg lines</rs> may help to find a reason for their failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>For instance, the fiasco of the mine explosion of <dateStruct value="-07-30"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="30">30th</day></dateStruct>, where well-laid plans and costly and toilsome labors were brought to shameful disaster through lack of earnest co-operation, and strange lethargy of participants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>For another instance, the unexampled reverses of our renowned <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">Second Corps</orgName> at <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Ream's Station</orgName>, <dateStruct value="-08-24"><month reg="08">August</month> <day reg="24">24th</day></dateStruct>, where, after every purpose and prospect of success, these veterans <pb id="p.21" n="21"/> were quickly driven from their entrenchments, even abandoning their guns,--conduct contrary to their habit and contradictory of their character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But these were exceptional even if illustrative cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Along our lines reigned a patient fortitude, a waiting expectation, unswerving loyalty, that kind of faith which is the <quote>evidence of things unseen.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/></p> 
<p>Among these men were some doubly deserving-comrades whom we thought lost, bravely returning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Many of those earlier wounded, or sickened, and sent to general hospital, proving to be not utterly disabled, and scorning the plea of the poltroon, came back to their appointed place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>So others, too, with like spirit, from the starving, wasting, and wearing experience of prisons, passing though the valley of the shadow of death, came to answer again the names that honored our roll-call,--those who could stand up to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Such were the remnants of that great company of heroic souls named the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Knowing full well the meaning of such words as hardship and suffering, facing unknown fields of sorrows yet to come, they stood fast by their consecration, offering all there is in manhood for the sake of what is best in man. If sometimes a shadow passes over such spirits, it needs neither confession nor apology. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Within a short time now the term of enlistment of not a few regiments had expired, and they were mustered out of service with honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It was a time when they were sorely needed; but we can scarcely <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> blame those who thought duty did not call them to prolong their experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Many, however, straightway enlisted in other regiments, new or old, and thus rendered a double service-material force and inspiring example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In some instances whole regiments had reenlisted, under the old name or a new <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Such were <num value="5">five</num> noble <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> regiments of my own brigade of <dateStruct value="1864-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Remnants of regiments also, left from casualties of the field or by term of enlistment, were consolidated into <num value="1">one</num>, named and numbered by its State order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Such were the <orgName type="regiment" key="ME1">1st Maine</orgName> Veterans, made up of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, and <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>, of glorious record. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Others, too, had come in to replace and reinforce, with like brave spirit, and perhaps with severer test,--<orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> regiments, full to the maximum in numbers, from important positions in the rear, as the <orgName n="Defenses of Washington" type="district">defenses of Washington</orgName>, and not expecting to be called to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>With the advantage of military discipline and acclimatization, their ponderous lines rolled on the astonished foe, with swift passages to glorious death and undying fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Witness the action of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1MEHvArtillery">1st Maine Heavy Artillery</orgName>, losing in <num value="1">one</num> fight at <placeName key="tgn,2114316" n="1.000 8" reg="spotsylvania, spotsylvania, virginia">Spottsylvania</placeName> <num value="264">264</num> men, and again more than <num value="600">600</num> in stern obedience to orders which should not have been given in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> futile charge on the lines of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>New regiments of infantry also came in, necessarily assigned to duty at the front,--high hearts, brave spirits; some of them rushed into the field without instruction in arms or training in practice <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> of endurance, the fiber of their bodies for a time not equal to the sincerity of their resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>But with the quickening of sharp demand and compelling need, spirit soon transformed body to its likeness, and meantime cheered and braced other hearts beating their old rhythm beneath the iron breasts of veterans. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>No jeering now for newness and niceness; but silent welcome, of respect and almost reverence, seeing that the young men had come willingly at such a time to such a front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> had brought prismatic colors down to plain monotone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Names of things were charged with deeper definitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>War was no longer a holiday excursion; it was <quote>hard-shelled</quote> business; not maturing in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, nor <num value="9">nine</num>, nor <num value="12">twelve</num>, nor <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>And the way of it was more bitter than the end. The regiments passing to the front marched not between festoons of ladies' smiles and waving handkerchiefs, thrown kisses and banner presentations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>They were looked upon sadly and in a certain awe, as those that had taken on themselves a doom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The muster rolls on which the name and oath were written were pledges of honor,--redeemable at the gates of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>And they who went up to them, knowing this, are on the lists of heroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It is true not all who came in now were strictly <quote>volunteers.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Some may have enlisted from shame of staying comfortably at home while manly men were at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Some may have preferred this to standing <quote>draft</quote> under terrors of the lot; for so the free will is sometimes bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>And others <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> may have been persuaded by the large local bounties, which the stern realities adverted to above induced many loud loyalists to offer to <quote>substitutes,</quote> to whom life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness were not quite so dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Glory had come to exemplify the altruistic virtues, and in such honor as <quote>dying for your country,</quote> self-regarding men scripturally <quote>preferred <num value="1">one</num> another</quote> ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>But there were those coming last who represented the heroism of homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>For wives, who had early offered the fathers of their children, house-bonds of human well-being, as sacrifices for their country's redemption, sent now their sons, to share their father's honor and perchance his grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Mothers, who had given their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-born, held not back their youngest now; the strongest <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then the dearest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>And the converse of this, the father following the son. Well might the lip of veteran quiver as his quick eye, scanning a squad of newcomers, caught the figure of some father, gray and grim, still so erect and eagle-eyed, straining for every semblance of youth, that he might be permitted to stand beside his boy whom he could not let come alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Nor is this sympathy unmarked in higher grades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>What has come over the spirit of that stern officer, pushing his column with relentless energy on the terrible forced march, that with furtive side-look as if half-ashamed, he draws the back of his sword-hand across his compressed eyelids, like the swift sign of the cross over the face of a prayer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>He has turned in his saddle to order the ambulance, or his own headquarters' wagon to <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> pick up from the trodden wayside some fallen, fainting boy, overweighted by the heavy armor of his country's defense, whose soul has carried him already far beyond his body's strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Some home-loved boy; and so soon, so nearly lost!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> help us all! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The exercise of thought that had been invited and sanctioned naturally fostered indulgence in some <quote>free thinking.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Some liberties were taken in canvassing the merits not only of commanders but rather more freely of campaigns,--particularly this <hi rend="italics">reductio ad absurdum</hi> of the siege of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>And they would have been something less than rational human beings if they did not indulge in some criticisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Too free expression of unfavorable opinion, it is true, might render <num value="1">one</num> liable to the counter charge of conduct to <quote>the prejudice of good order and military discipline.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But wisdom was also brought to use. Our soldiers had well learned the lesson that it is sometimes necessary to reverse the maxim of public law, and subordinate civil rights to military rules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Evil-minded people were trying to make our men believe that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00025.00071" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00025.00072" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> were making this long delay in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> in order to secure their continuance in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>But this was an outrage upon those noble characters, and an insult to the common sense of every man among us. We knew that the surest way for our high officials to hold their place was by no means to court delay, but to strike a quick, bold blow at the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00025.00073" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s change of base from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> <pb id="p.26" n="26"/> to the <rs>James</rs>, and his immediate objective from the front of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to its rear by way of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, called for no adverse criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>There were deep-felt reasons for acquiescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Nor could it be fairly criticized on purely military grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Although technically a change of base, it was not a change in his grand purpose,--<quote>to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>That meant there was to be no retreating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>And this might justly be considered a master stroke of grand tactics in the continuous movement to turn <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00026.00074" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s right, and also cut his communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>When we understood the purpose of this move we believed it to be good tactics, and we took it up with hope and cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought justified the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It was a well-planned and well-executed movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Our army was skilfully withdrawn from the front of a watchful and active enemy, and the main body of our army was before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> before <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00026.00075" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> knew it had crossed the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blow was well delivered; but a series of shortcomings, for which it must be said neither the men nor their immediate commanders were responsible, brought all to nought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Successive assaults on the enemy's lines were made as corps after corps extended leftward; but gallant fighting left little to show but its cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Especially did we hold in mind the last of these made by the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, when an assault was ordered, by my fine veteran Brigade on the strong entrenchments at <persName n="Rives,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00026.00076" reg="mostcommon:Rives,nomatch:0"><surname>Rives</surname></persName>' Salient commanding the important avenue of communication, the <pb id="p.27" n="27"/> <orgName n="Norfolk Railroad" type="railroad">Norfolk Railroad</orgName> and <address><street n="Jerusalem Plank Road">Jerusalem Plank Road</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We encountered a far outnumbering force of veteran troops well entrenched and a cross-fire of <num value="20">twenty</num> guns in earthworks planted with forethought and skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Desperate valor could accomplish nothing but its own demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Our veterans were hurled back over the stricken field, or left upon it-I, too, proud witness and sharer of their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>I am not of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> blood; she is of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>So ended the evening of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day. And the army sat down to that <measure n="10months" type="date">ten months</measure> symposium, from which <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men never rose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The development of this campaign led many to compare <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00027.00078" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> with <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00027.00079" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>They marched their armies over much the same ground, with much the same result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Only <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00027.00080" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was brought to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00027.00081" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was permitted to remain at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> and the <rs>Appomattox</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The rumor ran that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00027.00082" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had also proposed to cut across the <rs>James</rs> and around <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00027.00083" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:27"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Many still believed in his soldiership, but broader elements now entered into the estimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Something in the nature of the man and something in his environment caused his failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>With great organizing power, he failed in practical application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The realities of war seemed to daze him. He lacked dash, resolution; he hesitated to seize the golden moment, to profit by his own openings, to press his advantage, to solve doubt by daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>With all that marvelous magnetism which won the <pb id="p.28" n="28"/> love and enthusiasm of his subordinates, he lacked the skill, or the will, to gain the sympathy of his superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It is as much the requisite in generalship to secure the confidence and co-operation of the <rs>Government</rs> as to command armies and over come opposing force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It was unfortunate for him, also, that he allowed himself to be drawn into politics, which paid him in its own kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The foreshadowing thought of this created in his mind a <quote>double objective,</quote> which confused his purpose and benumbed his fighting energy as against possible fellow citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>But many circumstances were against him. Few seemed to realize that this was war. And many who influenced his surroundings thought they knew as much of war as he. At that time the <rs>North</rs> was in a craze; nobody would accept the suggestion that it would be a long and costly task to put down the rebellion, or even to break up the <rs>Southern</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The <rs>North</rs> was as arbitrary as the <rs>South</rs> was arrogant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Strong in its conviction of right, proud of its sponsorship for the old flag; stung, too, by the sharp rebuff to its assumption and its authority, the <rs>North</rs> did not count patience as the chief of virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Its cry was <quote><hi rend="italics">On</hi> to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>to capture the rebel capital so impudently set up in face of our own, and thus wipe out that pretended token of independence and sovereignty which gave pretext for foreign recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>For this had become an element in the contest,--the hostility of the <rs>French Emperor</rs>, and the <quote>nobility</quote> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with difficulty held back from recognizing <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> through the moral courage of John Bright aid the royal wisdom of the <rs>Queen</rs> and <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Consort</foreName></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The impatience of the <rs>North</rs> is perhaps to be pardoned for the reason of its impelling motive; but it demanded of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n0010.0003.00029.00084" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> impossibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>And these were created quite as much by forces in his rear as by those in his front. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>As for <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00029.00085" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, he was like <persName n="Thor,,,,," id="n0010.0003.00029.00086" reg="mostcommon:Thor,nomatch:0"><surname>Thor</surname></persName>, the hammerer; striking blow after blow, intent on his purpose to beat his way through, somewhat reckless of the cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Yet he was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="1">one</num> of our commanders who dared to pursue his policy of delay without apology or fear of overruling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>He made it a condition of his acceptancy of the chief command that he should not be interfered with from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>We received a hot fire which we did not halt to return as that would expose us to heavy loss, but advanced at the double quick to go over the enemy's works with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>At close quarters the sharpshooters in the tree-tops cut us up badly, but we still pressed on, only now and then, here and there, delivering fire ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>In the full crescendo of this, now close to the sawdust pile, my horse, wild for the front, all his pulses aglow, was exceeding the possible pace of the men following and I gave him a vigorous check on the curb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Resenting this, he touched his fore feet to earth only to rebound headhigh to the level of my face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Just at that instant a heavy blow struck me on the left breast just below <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>I fell forward on my horse's neck and lost all consciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The bullet at close range had been aimed at my breast, but the horse had lifted his head just in time to catch it, so that, passing through the big muscle of his neck (and also I may say through a leather case of field orders and a brass-mounted hand-mirror in my breast-pocket-we didn't carry towels in this campaign), demolished the pistol in the belt of my <persName n="Vogel,Aide-Lieutenant,,,," id="n0010.0004.00046.00178" reg="mostcommon:Vogel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Aide-Lieutenant">aide Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Vogel</surname></persName>, and knocked him out of the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>This, of course, I only knew afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The shock had stopped my horse, and I must have been for some little time unconscious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I knew an arm was around my waist and words murmured in my ear, <quote>My dear General, you are gone,</quote> the kindly voice of <persName n="Griffin,General,,,," id="n0010.0004.00046.00179" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,Charles,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Griffin</surname></persName> who had ridden up beside me. At that moment also a very different strain struck my ear on the other hand,a wild rebel yell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>As I lifted my head a glance showed me the right of our line broken and flying before the enemy like leaves before the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>This explains my answer to <persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00046.00180" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,Charles,,,:2"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName>, <quote>Yes, General, I am,</quote> --that is, <quote>gone</quote> in another sense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The bullet had riddled my sleeve to the elbow and bruised and battered my bridle arm so that it was useless, and the obstructions it met had slightly deflected it so that, instead of striking the point of my heart, it had followed around <num value="2">two</num> ribs so as to come out at the back seam of my coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The horse was bleeding profusely and my falling on his neck brought a blood relationship of which I was not ashamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Everybody around thought I was <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> <quote>gone</quote> indeed, and that is why a telegram went to the New York morning papers reporting me as killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>In the shock my cap had fallen to the ground, and I must have been a queer spectacle as I rose in the saddle tattered and battered, bareheaded and blood-smeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>I swung the rein against my horse's wounded neck and lightly touching his flank with my heel, we made a dash for the rally of our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Pushing in among our broken ranks or our Ig8th <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, the men might well have thought me a messenger from the other world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>That rally was sharp work-and costly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>Down at the extreme right, in the maddened whirl, I found the brave <rs>Sickel</rs>, his face aflame, rallying his men with an appeal none could resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>In a moment after he fell by my side with a shattered arm. With him was that heroic boy <persName n="McEuen,Major,,,," id="n0010.0004.00047.00181" reg="mostcommon:McEuen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>McEuen</surname></persName> who high above all thought of self was dashing into the seething crest of battle and was shot from his saddle within touch of my unavailing hand; so passed a noble spirit, a sweet soul, only son of his proud father and last of his race on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>By such appeal and offering this gallant regiment, forced back by overpowering onset, straightened up into line again, and with a thrilling, almost appalling cheer, turned the tide of battle, and rolled it fairly back inside the enemy's works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Aware of some confusion near the sawdust pile I thought it fitting to return to my place at the center.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>I was astonished at the greeting of cheers which marked my course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>Strangest of all was that when I emerged to the sight of the enemy, <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> they also took up the cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>I hardly knew what world I was in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>By the time I got back to the center the loss of blood had exhausted the strength of my horse, and his nose came to earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>I had to send him back and become a foot soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>It was a critical time there, with much confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/><persName n="Glenn,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00048.00182" reg="mostcommon:Glenn,nomatch:0"><surname>Glenn</surname></persName> was having a hard time at the sawdust pile, and I worked myself forward in the crowd to get at the state of things in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>By a sudden backset I found myself surrounded by Confederates, who courteously lowered their muskets and locked their bayonets around me to indicate a reception not easily to be declined, and probably to last some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>The old coat was dingy almost to gray; I was bareheaded, and rather a doubtful character anyway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I thought it warrantable to assume an extremely friendly relation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>To their exhortation I replied: <quote>Surrender?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>What's the matter with you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>What do you take me for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Don't you see these <persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00048.00183" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,nomatch:0"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName> right onto us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Come along with me and let us break 'em.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>I still had my right arm and my light sword, and I gave a slight flourish indicating my wish and their direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>They did follow me like brave fellows,--most of them too far; for they were a long time getting back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>There was a little lull shortly afterwards, but quite a curious crowd around the sawdust pile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/><persName n="Spear,Colonel,,,," id="n0010.0004.00048.00184" reg="mostcommon:Spear,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Spear</surname></persName> of my old <orgName type="regiment" key="ME20">20th Maine</orgName>, who charged himself with a certain care for me, came up now and with a mysterious and impressive look, as if about to present a brevet commission, drew from <pb id="p.49" n="49"/> his breast-pocket an implement or utensil somewhat resembling a flask, which he confidentially assured me contained some very choice wine, of which he invited me to take a swallow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>Now that word is a very indeterminate and flighty term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>As I took the instrument in hand, I perceived it to be a Jamaica-ginger bottle frugally indented on all sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>I elevated it at the proper angle of incidence without, perhaps, sufficiently observing that of reflection; but I thought masonic courtesy would be observed if I stopped when the bubble indicated <quote>spirit-level.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>I returned the equitable remainder to him with commendation and grateful thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>But the melancholy, martyr-like look on his face as he held it up to the light, revealed his inward thought that in appropriating his courtesy I had availed myself to the extreme of my privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>My friend in later years seeks to get even with me by recalling this story on festive occasions for the entertainment of friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>I do not like to admit the charge against myself, but have no hesitation in entering the plea on behalf of my accessory, the bottle, of extremely extenuating circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>I was glad the <rs>Colonel</rs> was not on my staff then, and I did not have to meet him at evening. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>We were soon parted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>A hoarse yell rose through the tumult on the left, where the impetuous <rs>Sniper</rs> had tried to carry the breastworks in the woods, and now, badly cut up, his regiment was slowly falling back, closely followed by the enemy pouring out from their works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>They were soon pressed back to a line perpendicular to their proper <pb id="p.50" n="50"/> front, and the flight was fierce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Meantime, I scarcely know how, nor by whom helped, I found myself mounted on the back of a strange, dulllooking white horse, that had been bespattered by the trodden earth, and as I rode down among my fine New Yorkers, I must have looked more than ever like a figure from the <name>Apocalypse</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>There I found the calm, cold-steel face of <persName n="Sniper,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00050.00185" reg="nearbymention:Sniper,Gustave,,,"><surname>Sniper</surname></persName>, who had snatched his regimental colors from the dead hands of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> color-bearer that had gone down under them in the last half-hour, and was still holding his shattered ranks facing the storm; himself tossing on the crest of every wave, rolling and rocking like a ship laying to in the teeth of a gale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>I dispatched a staff-officer for <persName n="Gregory,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00050.00186" reg="nearbymention:Gregory,Edgar,M.,,"><surname>Gregory</surname></persName> to attack where I supposed him to be, in position to enfilade the enemy's newly gained alignment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>In response up rode <persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00050.00187" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,Charles,,,:2"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName>, anxious and pale, his voice ringing with a strange tone, as of mingled command and entreaty: <quote>If you can hold on there <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>, I will give you a battery.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>That was a great tonic: <persName n="Griffin,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00050.00188" reg="mostcommon:Griffin,Charles,,,:2"><surname>Griffin</surname></persName>'s confidence and his guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>There was quite an eminence a little to our rear, behind which I was intending to re-form my line should it be driven from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>I changed my plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>Pushing through to <persName n="Sniper,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00050.00189" reg="nearbymention:Sniper,Gustave,,,"><surname>Sniper</surname></persName>, I shouted in his ear in a voice the men should hear: <quote>Once more!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>Try the steel!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Hell for <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> and we are out of it!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/></p> 
<p>I had no idea we could carry the woods, or hold them if we did. My real objective was that knoll in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>I wanted to keep the enemy from pressing <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> over it before we could get our guns up. A desperate resort was necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>While a spirit as it were superhuman took possession of minds and bodies; energies of will, contradicting all laws of dynamics, reversed the direction of the surging wave, and dashed it back upon the woods and breastworks within them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Having the enemy now on the defensive, I took occasion to let <persName n="Sniper,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00051.00190" reg="nearbymention:Sniper,Gustave,,,"><surname>Sniper</surname></persName> know my purpose and plan, and to instruct his men accordingly: to demoralize the enemy by a smashing artillery fire, and then charge the woods by similar bolt-like blast of men. They took this in with calm intelligence, and braced assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>I knew they would do all possible to man. All the while I was straining eyes and prayers for a sight of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>And now they come-B of the <orgName type="regiment" key="4Regular">4th Regulars</orgName>, <persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00051.00191" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> leading with headlong speed, horses smoking, battery thundering with jolt and rattle, wheeling into action front, on the hillock I had been saving for them, while the earth flew beneath the wheels,--magnificent, the shining, terrible Napoleons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>I rode out to meet them, pointing out the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>I did not see anything in the situation to smile at, but he evidently did. I should have remembered my remarkable personal appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>He did not smile long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The colloquy was short: <quote><persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00051.00193" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>, do you think you can put solid shot or percussion into those woods close over the rebels' heads, without hurting my men?</quote> --<quote>Yes, Sir!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>But stop quick at my signal, and fire clear of my men when they charge.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/></p> 
<p>It was splendid and terrible: the swift-served, bellowing, leaping big guns; the thrashing of the solid shot into the woods; the flying splinters and branches and tree-tops coming down upon the astonished heads; shouts changing into shrieks at the savage work of these unaccustomed missiles; then answering back the burst of fire oblique upon the left front of the battery, where there was a desperate attempt to carry it by flank attack; repulsed by <persName n="Sniper,,,,," id="n0010.0004.00052.00194" reg="nearbymention:Sniper,Gustave,,,"><surname>Sniper</surname></persName> drawing to the left, and thus also leaving clear range for closer cutting projectiles, when now case shot and shell, now a blast of canister, poured into the swarming, swirling foe. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>My <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> was holding itself in the line of woods they had carried, reversing the breastworks there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>It is soon over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>The general plan was well understood by us all, and the specific written orders were in perfect accordance with the idea in our minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>It was to be mainly a flank and rear attack,--a cyclone sweep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>The intention evidently was that <pb id="p.158" n="158"/> our cavalry should engage the enemy's attention by vigorous demonstrations on their right and center, while the left of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName>-<orgName n="Division"><persName n="Ayres,,,,," id="n0010.0006.00158.01150" reg="mostcommon:Ayres,nomatch:0"><surname>Ayres</surname></persName>' Division</orgName> &mdash; should strike the left of the enemy's entrenched line at the angle or return on the <rs type="place">White Oak Road</rs>, and on this pivot the whole corps should make a great left turn and flank and envelop the enemy's entire position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>The importance of the battle was felt, and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0010.0006.00158.01151" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,Phil,,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s impatience shared by all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>But our actual movement was based on an imperfect reconnoissance, and a diagram made therefrom greatly misled us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>By this, not a man of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> could reach the <rs type="place">White Oak Road</rs> without doing so on top of the enemy entrenched upon it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>The diagram placed the angle of the enemy's works at the crossing of the <rs type="place">White Oak Road</rs> and the road we were formed on,--the <rs type="place">Gravelly Run Church Road</rs>; while as matter of fact, the angle was <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">one thousand yards</measure> west of this crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>So that <quote>the line as formed</quote> moving forward, <pb id="p.159" n="159"/> instead of its right striking the angle, as the diagram indicated, the left of the line would pass it at the distance of nearly <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>, as <persName n="Ayres,,,,," id="n0010.0006.00159.01154" reg="mostcommon:Ayres,nomatch:0"><surname>Ayres</surname></persName> did. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Nor were the troops in the main works and about the <quote>angle</quote> and the <quote>return</quote> --as both the orders and the diagram indicated-by any means all the force we had to contend with that day. <persName n="Lee,,Fitzhugh,,," id="n0010.0006.00159.01160" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><foreName>Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="cavalry">cavalry</orgName>, dismounted, now commanded by <persName n="Munford,,,,," id="n0010.0006.00159.01161" reg="mostcommon:Munford,nomatch:0"><surname>Munford</surname></persName>,--among them <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n0010.0006.00159.01162" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s old brigade, and as their officers said, <quote>as good marksmen as ever fired a gun,</quote> --were confronting our advance, all the way round, not less than <pb id="p.160" n="160"/> <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> skilled and veteran soldiers,--no sort of people to be ignored by us, nor by those reporting the battle to be wholly on the angle and on our cavalry front. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Now this was a very different state of facts from that anticipated and pictured by us, and we had to rectify all our lines under heavy fire in the midst of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>Who was responsible for this misapprehension?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>It would appear that the staff officer making the reconnoissance had not examined the whole field or all of the enemy's position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>But a discrepancy of a <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">thousand yards</measure> in a report of such consequence is a pretty wide error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>At any rate there was a very imperfect reconnoissance, from which we all suffered; but it would be very unjust to place the blame on the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> or its commander. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>Beneath it, that stormcenter spirit, that form of condensed energies, mounted on the grim charger, <placeName key="tgn,2057358" n="1.000 20" reg="rienzi, alcorn, mississippi">Rienzi</placeName>, that turned the battle of the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>,--both, rider and steed, of an unearthly shade of darkness, terrible to look upon, as if masking some unknown powers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>For a moment it is a glorious sight: every arm of the service in full play,--cavalry, artillery, infantry; then a sudden shifting scene as the cavalry, disengaged by successive squadrons, rally under their bugle-calls with beautiful precision and promptitude, and sweep like a storm-cloud beyond our right to close in on the enemy's left and complete the fateful envelopment. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>Their last hope is gone,--to break through our cavalry before our infantry can get up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>It is the end!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>They are now giving way, but keep good front, by force of old habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>Halfway up the slope they make a stand, with what perhaps they think a good omen,behind a stone wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>I try a little artillery on them, which directs their thoughts towards the crest behind them, and stiffen my lines for a rush, anxious for that crest myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>My intensity may have seemed like excitement.

<p>This is a singular episode for such a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>So we took this for orders, and on the crest we stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/><num value="1">One</num> booming cannonshot passed close along our front, and in the next moment all was still. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>We had done it,--had <quote>exposed ourselves to the view of the enemy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>But it was an exposure that worked <num value="2">two</num> ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2252"/>For there burst upon our vision a mighty scene, fit cadence of the story of tumultuous years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>Encompassed by the cordon of steel that crowned the heights about the <rs type="place">Court House</rs>, on the slopes of the valley formed by the sources of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, lay the remnants of that far-famed counterpart and companion of our own in momentous history,--the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>-<orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00237.01788" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>In the meantime <rs>Crawford</rs>'s troops have begun to arrive, and form in between <persName n="Gregory,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00237.01789" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,Edgar,M.,,:1"><surname>Gregory</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bartlett,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00237.01790" reg="mostcommon:Bartlett,Joseph,J.,,:1"><surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> on our left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>It was hilly, broken ground, in effect a vast amphitheater, stretching a mile perhaps from crest to crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>On the several confronting slopes before us dusky masses of infantry suddenly resting in place; blocks of artillery, standing fast in column or mechanically swung into park; clouds of cavalry small and great, slowly moving, in simple restlessness;--all without apparent attempt at offense or defense, or even military order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>In the hollow is the <rs>Appomattox</rs>,--which we had made the dead-line for our baffled foe, for its whole length, a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure>; here but a rivulet that might almost be stepped over dry-shod, and at the road crossing not thought worth while to bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/><pb id="p.238" n="238"/> Around its edges, now trodden to mire, swarms an indescribable crowd: worn-out soldier struggling to the front; demoralized citizen and denizen, <rs type="color">white</rs>, <rs type="color">black</rs>, and all shades between,--following <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00238.01791" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, of flying before these suddenly confronted terrible <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> pictured to them as demon-shaped and bent; animals, too, of all forms and grades; vehicles of every description and nondescription,--public and domestic, <num value="4">four</num>-wheeled, or <num value="2">two</num>, or <num value="1">one</num>,--heading and moving in every direction, a swarming mass of chaotic confusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>All this within sight of every eye on our bristling crest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2260"/>Had <num value="1">one</num> the heart to strike at beings so helpless, the <rs>Appomattox</rs> would quickly become a surpassing <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName> horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2261"/>But the very spectacle brings every foot to an instinctive halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2262"/>We seem the possession of a dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2263"/>We are lost in a vision of human tragedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2264"/>But our light-<num value="12">twelve</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00238.01792" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> guns come rattling up behind us to go into battery; we catch the glitter of the cavalry blades and brasses beneath the oak groves away to our right, and the ominous closing in on the fated foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2265"/>So with a fervor of devout joy,--as when, perhaps, the old crusaders <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> caught sight of the holy city of their quest,--with an up-going of the heart that was half paean, half prayer, we dash forward to the consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2266"/>A solitary fieldpiece in the edge of the town gives an angry but expiring defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2267"/>We press down a little slope, through a swamp, over a bright swift stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2268"/>Our advance is already in the town,--only the narrow street between the opposing lines, and <pb id="p.239" n="239"/> hardly that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2269"/>There is wild work, that looks like fighting; but not much killing, nor even hurting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2270"/>The disheartened enemy take it easy; our men take them easier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2271"/>It is a wild, mild fusing,--earnest, but not deadly earnest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2272"/>A young orderly of mine, unable to contain himself, begs permission to go forward, and dashes in, sword-flourishing as if he were a terrible fellow, --and soon comes back, hugging <num value="4">four</num> sabers to his breast, speechless at his achievement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2273"/>We were advancing, tactically fighting, and I was somewhat uncertain as to how much more of the strenuous should be required or expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2274"/>But I could not give over to this weak mood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2275"/>My right was <quote>in the air,</quote> advanced, unsupported, towards the enemy's general line, exposed to flank attack by troops I could see in the distance across the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2276"/>I held myself on that extreme flank, where I could see the cavalry which we had relieved, now forming in column of squadrons ready for a dash to the front, and I was anxiously hoping it would save us from the flank attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2277"/>Watching intently, my eye was caught by the figure of a horseman riding out between those lines, soon joined by another, and taking a direction across the cavalry front towards our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2278"/>They were nearly a mile away, and I curiously watched them till lost from sight in the nearer broken ground and copses between. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2279"/>Suddenly rose to sight another form, close in our own front,--a soldierly young figure, a Confederate staff officer undoubtedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2280"/>Now I see the white <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> flag earnestly borne, and its possible purport sweeps before my inner vision like a wraith of morning mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2281"/>He comes steadily on, the mysterious form in gray, my mood so whimsically sensitive that I could even smile at the material of the flag,--wondering where in either army was found a towel, and <num value="1">one</num> so white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2282"/>But it bore a mighty message,--that simple emblem of homely service, wafted hitherward above the dark and crimsoned streams that never can wash themselves away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2283"/>The messenger draws near, dismounts; with graceful salutation and hardly suppressed emotion delivers his message: <quote>Sir, I am from <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0010.0008.00240.01793" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,Seth,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>. <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0010.0008.00240.01794" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> desires a cessation of hostilities until he can hear from <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0010.0008.00240.01795" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> as to the proposed surrender.</quote>

<p>Now from the right come foaming up in cavalry fashion the <num value="2">two</num> forms I had watched from away beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2294"/>A white flag again, held strong aloft, making straight for the little group beneath our battle-flag, high borne also,--the red <rs>Maltese</rs> cross on a field of white, that had thrilled hearts long ago.

<p>The various accounts that have been since given of the reception of the flag of truce on this occasion might lead to the impression upon readers of history that we were all under great agitation of mind and that our memories were somewhat confused or possibly our habit of truth telling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2304"/>I was doubtful of my duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2305"/>The flag of truce was in, but I had no right to act upon it without orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2306"/>There was still some firing from various quarters, lulling a little where the white flag passed near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2307"/>But I did not press things quite so hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2308"/>Just then a last cannon-shot from the edge of the <pb id="p.242" n="242"/> town plunges through the breast of a gallant and dear young officer in my front line,--<persName n="Clark,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0010.0008.00242.01810" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY185">185th New York</orgName>,--the last man killed in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, if not the last in the <rs type="place">Appomattox lines</rs>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2474"/>He contented himself by mounting his whole staff and with the division flag riding around our lines and conversing as he found opportunity with the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2475"/>This in no manner disturbed me; my place and part were definite and clear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2476"/>Our earnest eyes scan the busy groups on the opposite slopes, breaking camp for the last time, taking down their little shelter-tents and folding them carefully as precious things, then slowly forming ranks as for unwelcome duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2477"/>And now they move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2478"/>The dusky swarms forge forward into gray columns of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2479"/>On they come, with the old-swinging route step and swaying battleflags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2480"/>In the van, the proud Confederate ensign &mdash; the great field of white with canton of star-strewn cross of blue on a field of red, the regimental <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> battle-flags with the same escutcheon following on, crowded so thick, by thinning out of men, that the whole column seemed crowned with red.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2481"/>The momentous meaning of this occasion impressed me deeply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2482"/>I resolved to mark it by some token of recognition, which could be no other than a salute of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2483"/>Well aware of the responsibility assumed, and of the criticisms that would follow, as the sequel proved, nothing of that kind could move me in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2484"/>The act could be defended, if needful, by the suggestion that such a salute was not to the cause for which the flag of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> stood, but to its going down before the flag of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2485"/>My main reason, however, was <num value="1">one</num> for which I sought no authority nor asked forgiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2486"/>Before us in proud humiliation stood the embodiment of manhood: men whom neither toils and sufferings, nor the fact of death, nor disaster, nor hopelessness could bend from their resolve; standing before us now, thin, worn, and famished, but erect, and with eyes looking level into ours, waking memories that bound us together as no other bond;--was not such manhood to be welcomed back into a Union so tested and assured? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2487"/>Instructions had been given; and when the head of each division column comes opposite our group, <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> our bugle sounds the signal and instantly our whole line from right to left, regiment by regiment in succession, gives the soldier's salutation, from the <quote>order arms</quote> to the old <quote>carry</quote> --the marching salute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2488"/>Gordon at the head of the column, riding with heavy spirit and downcast face, catches the sound of shifting arms, looks up, and, taking the meaning, wheels superbly, making with himself and his horse <num value="1">one</num> uplifted figure, with profound salutation as he drops the point of his sword to the boot toe; then facing to his own command, gives word for his successive brigades to pass us with the same position of the manual,--honor answering honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2489"/>On our part not a sound of trumpet more, nor roll of drum; not a cheer, nor word nor whisper of vain-glorying, nor motion of man standing again at the order, but an awed stillness rather, and breath-holding, as if it were the passing of the dead! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2490"/>As each successive division masks our own, it halts, the men face inward towards us across the road, <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> away; then carefully <quote>dress</quote> their line, each captain taking pains for the good appearance of his company, worn and half starved as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2491"/>The field and staff take their positions in the intervals of regiments; generals in rear of their commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2519"/>There was opportunity for converse with several Confederate generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2520"/>Their bearing was, of course, serious, their spirits sad. What various misgivings mingled in their mood we could not but conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2521"/>Levying war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was serious business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2522"/>But <num value="1">one</num> certain impression was received from them all; they were ready to accept for themselves and for <pb id="p.266" n="266"/> the <rs>Confederacy</rs> any fate our Government should dictate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2523"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00266.01956" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s magnanimity, as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0008.00266.01957" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s thoughtfulness, had already impressed them much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2524"/>They spoke like brave men who mean to stand upon their honor and accept the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2525"/><quote>General,</quote> says <num value="1">one</num> of them at the head of his corps, <quote>this is deeply humiliating; but I console myself with the thought that the whole country will rejoice at this day's business.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2526"/><quote>You astonish us,</quote> says another of equally high rank, <quote>by your honorable and generous conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2527"/>I fear we should not have done the same by you had the case been reversed.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2528"/><quote>I will go home,</quote> says a gallant officer from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <quote>and tell <persName n="Johnston,,Joe,,," id="n0010.0008.00266.01958" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> we can't fight such men as you. I will advise him to surrender.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2529"/><quote>I went into that cause</quote> says yet another of well-known name, <quote>and I meant it. We had our choice of weapons and of ground, and we have lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2530"/>Now that is my flag (pointing to the flag of the <rs>Union</rs>), and I will prove myself as worthy as any of you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2531"/></p> 
<p>In fact that was the whole drift of the talk, and there is no reason to doubt that it was sincere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2532"/>Equally so but quite different was the strain of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2533"/>I saw him moving restlessly about, scolding his men and being answered back by them instead of ordering them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2534"/>He seemed so disturbed in mind that I rode down the line to see if I could not give him a word of cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2535"/>With a respectful salutation, calling his attention to the bearing of the men on both sides, <quote>This promises well for our coming good-will,</quote> said I; <quote>brave men may become <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> good friends.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2536"/><quote>You're mistaken, sir,</quote> he turned and said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2537"/><quote>You may forgive us but we won't be forgiven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2538"/>There is a rancor in our hearts [here came in an anatomical gesture] which you little dream of. We hate you, sir.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2539"/><quote>Oh, we don't mind much about dreams, nor about hates either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2540"/>Those <num value="2">two</num> lines of business are closed,</quote> was the quiet reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2541"/>Then as if a little sorry for his opening, fixing his gaze on <num value="2">two</num> ungainly looking holes in the breast of my coat and a much-abused sleeve, he exclaimed in a milder tone: <quote>Those were ugly shots, General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2542"/>Where did you get these?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2543"/>Unfortunately I had to admit that this happened on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the campaign in an afternoon I had the honor of spending with him and his party on the <rs type="place">Quaker Road</rs>, where there were plenty of quakers and shakers also, and some few runners who left me a parting souvenir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2544"/><quote>I suppose you think you did great things there,</quote> he burst in. <quote>I was ordered to attack you and check your advance; and I did it too with a vim, till I found I was fighting <num value="3">three</num> <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, when I thought it prudent to retire.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2545"/>I was really sorry to have to reassure him that there was no more than the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> part of <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> present on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2546"/><quote>I know better,</quote> he cries; <quote>I saw the flags myself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2547"/>I think that he did stop to count <num value="3">three</num> before he left us, leaving his cap behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2548"/>But I could not resist saying: <quote>You saw the flags of <num value="3">three</num> regiments; steady eyes could see no more.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2549"/><num value="1">One</num> of his staff officers corroborates this, and for a moment he subsides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2550"/>Then he breaks out again: <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> <quote>It's a pity you have no lawyers in your army,</quote> --I did not know what was coming now, unless he wanted to make his will,--<quote>you don't know how to make out paroles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2551"/>Who ever heard of paroles being signed by any but the parties paroled?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2552"/>I tried to explain to him that this was a matter of mercy and humanity, for if we should keep all their men there till every individual could sign his parole, half of them would be dead of starvation before their turn came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2553"/><quote>Nonsense,</quote> he rejoins; <quote>all that is <hi rend="italics">spargere voces</hi>; every lawyer knows such a parole as this is a mere <foreign lang="la">brutum fulmen</foreign>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2554"/><quote>Sir,</quote> I answer, <quote>if by brute thunderbolts you mean a pledged word to keep the peace accepted and adopted by the recipient of the favor, I don't believe your people need any lawyer to instruct them as to the word of honor.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2555"/>I was about to turn away; he catches the suggestion of the motion and issues a parting order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2556"/><quote>You go home,</quote> he cries, <quote>you take these fellows home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2557"/>That's what will end the war.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2558"/><quote>Don't worry about the end of the war,</quote> I answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2559"/><quote>We are going home pretty soon, but not till we see you home.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2560"/><quote>Home!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2561"/>he snatches up the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2562"/><quote>We haven't any. You have destroyed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>You have invaded <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and ruined her. Her curse is on you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/><quote>You shouldn't have invited us down here then,</quote> was the obvious reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2565"/><quote>We expected somebody was going to get hurt when we took up your challenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2566"/>Didn't you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2567"/>People who don't want to get hurt, General, had better not force a fight on unwilling <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2568"/><pb id="p.269" n="269"/> </p> 
<p>By this time the thing grew comic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2569"/>The staff officers both in blue and gray laughed outright; and even his men looked around from their somber service and smiled as if they enjoyed the joke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2570"/>He turned away also to launch his <quote>brute thunderbolts,</quote> not waiting to receive my thanks for instruction in Law and Latin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2571"/><quote>The wise man foreseeth the evil and hideth himself, but the foolish pass on and are punished, says the old proverb.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2572"/>If there are no exceptions to this rule, then this gentleman was not rightly named. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2573"/>With this comedy ends, in classic fashion, the stern drama of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2574"/>A strange and somber shadow rose up ghost-like from the haunts of memory or habit, and rested down over the final parting scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2575"/>How strong are these ties of habit!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2576"/>How strange the undertone of sadness even at the release from prison and from pain!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2577"/>It seems as if we had put some precious part of ourselves there which we are loath to leave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2578"/>When all is over, in the dusk of evening, the long lines of scattered cartridges are set on fire, and the lurid flames wreathing the blackness of earthly shadows give an unearthly border to our parting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2579"/>Then, stripped of every token of enmity or instrument of power to hurt, they march off to give their word of honor never to lift arms against the old flag again till its holders release them from their promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2580"/>Then, their ranks broken, the bonds that bound them fused away by forces stronger than fire, they are free at last to go where <pb id="p.270" n="270"/> they will; to find their homes, now most likely stricken, despoiled by war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2581"/><num value="27000">Twenty-seven thousand</num> men paroled; <num value="17000">seventeen thousand</num> stand of arms laid down or gathered up; a <num value="100">hundred</num> battle-flags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2582"/>But regiments and brigades-or what is left of them &mdash; have scarce a score of arms to surrender; having thrown them away by road and riverside in weariness of flight or hopelessness of heart, disdaining to carry them longer but to disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2583"/>And many a bare staff was there laid down, from which the ensign had been torn in the passion and struggle of emotions, and divided piece by piece; a blurred or shrunken star, a rag of smoke-stained blue from the war-worn cross, a shred of deepened dye from the rent field of red, to be treasured for precious keepsakes of manhood's test and heirlooms for their children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2584"/>Nor blame them too much for this, nor us for not blaming them more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2585"/>Although, as we believed, fatally wrong in striking at the old flag, misreading its deeper meaning and the innermost law of the people's life, blind to the signs of the times in the march of man, they fought as they were taught, true to such ideals as they saw, and put into their cause their best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2586"/>For us they were fellow-soldiers as well, suffering the fate of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2587"/>We could not look into those brave, bronzed faces, and those battered flags we had met on so many fields where glorious manhood lent a glory to the earth that bore it, and think of personal hate and mean revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2588"/>Whoever had misled these men, we had not. We had led them back, home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>Whoever had <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> made that quarrel, we had not. It was a remnant of the inherited curse for sin. We had purged it away, with blood-offerings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>We were all of us together factors of that high will which, working often through illusions of the human, and following ideals that lead through storms, evolves the enfranchisement of man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>Forgive us, therefore, if from stern, steadfast faces eyes dimmed with tears gazed at each other across that pile of storied relics so dearly there laid down, and brothers' hands were fain to reach across that rushing tide of memories which divided us, yet made us forever <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>It was our glory only that the victory we had won was for country, for the well-being of others, of these men before us as well as for ourselves and ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>Our joy was a deep, far, unspoken satisfaction,--the approval, as it were, of some voiceless and veiled divinity like the appointed <quote>Angel of the nation</quote> of which the old scriptures tell &mdash; leading and looking far, yet mindful of sorrows; standing above all human strife and fierce passages of trial; not marking faults nor seeking blame; transmuting into factors of the final good corrected errors and forgiven sins; assuring of immortal inheritance all pure purpose and noble endeavor, humblest service and costliest sacrifice, unconscious and even mistaken martyrdoms offered and suffered for the sake of man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>Now on the morrow, over all the hillsides in the peaceful sunshine, are clouds of men on foot or horse, singly or in groups, making their earnest way <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> as by the instinct of the ant, each with his own little burden, each for his own little home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>And we are left alone, and lonesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>We miss our spirited antagonists in the game, and we lose interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>The weight is taken out of the opposite scale, and we go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>Never are we less gay. And when we took up the long, round &mdash; about march homeward, it was dull to plod along looking only at the muddy road, without scouts and skirmishers ahead, and reckless of our flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>It was tame to think we could ride up to any thicket of woods we pleased, without starting at the chirrup of those little bluebirds whose cadence was so familiar to our ears, and made so deep a lodgment in our bosoms too, sometimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>It was dreary to lie down and sleep at night and think there was no vigilant picket out on the dubious-looking crests around to keep faithful watch and ward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>And it seems sheer waste of opportunity and mark of military incapacity, when we emerge from some deep wood or defile and no battery belches destruction upon us from so advantageous a position as the commanding heights beyond. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>But slowly these lingering images of memory or habit are lost in the currents of a deeper mood; we wonder at that mysterious dispensation whereby the pathway of the kingdom of Love on earth must needs be cut through by the sword, and why it must be that by such things as we had seen and done and suffered, and lost and won, a step is taken in the homeward march of man. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>Although fraught with deepest interest and filled with occupations of great variety, our sojourn at <placeName reg="Appomattox Court House">Appomattox Court House</placeName> was a hard experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>We had raced to that point in lightest marching order; there was no superfluity of equipage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>The packs were slender; overcoats and blankets had proved too heavy for those <measure n="30mile" type="distance">thirty-mile</measure> marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>The shelter-tent cloths had to serve for these, and for towels also, which they most resembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>The rations reduced to sediment in the haversacks smelt of lead and gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>To be sure, a few supply wagons had managed to get up to us, and our cavalry had captured some trains at <placeName reg="Appomattox Station">Appomattox Station</placeName>; but all we had we shared with our surrendering competitors, technically called <quote>the enemy,</quote> now become our sympathizing guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>For a day or <num value="2">two</num> past all hands had to forage for a living, and many a <measure n="10mile" type="distance">ten-mile</measure> tramp resulted only in armfuls of corn on the cob, which needed a good deal of soaking to yield to our practised jaws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>It got it. For when on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> we took up the <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> march for <placeName key="tgn,2110885" n="1.000 4" reg="burkeville, nottoway, virginia">Burkeville</placeName> and had got well stretched out on the road, we were overtaken by a pouring rain, which made mulch of everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>Seeking the center of the earth by a force of gravity we could fully sympathize with, it soon formed a junction in the roads and fields to the extent of <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure> of <quote>half and half,</quote> denominated in the <rs>Low-German</rs> dialect <quote>mudde</quote> ; but later circumstances inclined certain travelers to transpose the superfluous final <quote>d</quote> and put it to use as the initial prefix of a deeply descriptive adjective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>Drenched, hungry, draggled in mire, that long, lank body presented an image not unlike that reported by <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00274.01959" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,nomatch:0"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName> on the king's dream,--the head gold, the belly brass, the legs iron, and the feet clay,but the proportions were not so well observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>We were informed in animated tones that we were to draw rations that night,--but what kind of a <quote>draw</quote> it was to be we were by no means assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>We noticed that the goal was fixed a long stretch ahead; it suggested to us what we had seen offered a team of cattle tolled on by a show of forage fastened well forward of the yoke or pole. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>Near <placeName reg="Evergreen Station">Evergreen Station</placeName> we struck the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside Railroad</orgName>, and hoping to save the men's strength, I told the colonel of the leading regiment to have his men take the railroad track and keep out of the heavy mud. They tried it for a while, but soon I saw them jumping back into the mire ankle deep; and, wondering at this, I felt rebuked for my simplicity, when informed that the men found it much more wearing to watch the varying distance of the <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> cross-ties spaced anywhere from <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> to <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure>, and measure every step accordingly, than to take the road as it was, and be free to put their feet down wherever they could get them out again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>So dear is liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>Long after dark we were led to a place designated for a camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>To reach this we were countermarched or turned off on a tangent for quite a space, and halted on a flat-pine land, some cubit lower and knee deeper than the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2619"/>I heard no orders given the regiments to <quote>break ranks,</quote> the effort of the officers was to get their men together, that they might be looked after, and possibly, though a whimsical suggestion, to draw rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>But no commissary could find us in that dark and drench, even if the wagons could worry through the muddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>Fire would be of no use; the thought of trying to make <num value="1">one</num> would do more good, for it would raise our spirits to join <quote>the mighty laughter of the vernal floods.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>It was interesting to hear the men-poor fellows-making their beds, some on the rugged roots of the pines, or cradled between <num value="2">two</num> broken branches to lift them from softer pillows, or securing the shelter of a big bough, which ever and anon swaying under accumulated weight, bent down to envelop them in unwelcome <quote>sheets.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>Now some <num value="1">one</num> seeking the open,less covering the best,--reckless of all things, now that they had returned to <quote>chaos and old night.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>To us, in so-called headquarters-though quarters were not perfectly distinguished that night amidst such mingling of the elements &mdash; a kind of icnthyosaurian sleep came at last-dreaming that the whole earth was about this way once, and fully sympathizing with the <name>Hebrew</name> description of it as <quote>Tohoo vaw Vohoo,</quote> if not exactly <quote>without form and void.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2631"/>All the domestic arts were soon in evidence, --largely that of washing-day;--as if we had not had enough in the previous <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. Gradually a Sabbath peace stole over the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2632"/>All were at rest, mind and body, and the very heart of nature breathed soft airs and mellow light. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2633"/>Headquarters had been taken in the ample front yard of an old mansion of the ancient regime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>They were in the midst of a bright and joyous strain when there came <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> galloping up the old familiar figure &mdash; the mudsplashed, grave-faced, keen-eyed cavalryman,the message-bearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>It was no uncommon thing to receive a military telegram in those days; but something in the manner and look of this messenger took my attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>My <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">First Brigade</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Sniper,Colonel,,,," id="n0010.0009.00287.01994" reg="mostcommon:Sniper,Gustave,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Sniper</surname></persName>, had its headquarters at <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00287.01995" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s, which was in the vicinity of our conflicts on the <rs type="place">White Oak Road</rs>; my <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">Second Brigade</orgName>, under <persName n="Gregory,General,,,," id="n0010.0009.00287.01996" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,Edgar,M.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>, made headquarters at <placeName reg="Ford's Station">Ford's Station</placeName>, its jurisdiction covering the battlefields of <placeName reg="Five Forks, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111769">Five Forks</placeName>, <persName n="Dinwiddie,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00287.01997" reg="mostcommon:Dinwiddie,nomatch:0"><surname>Dinwiddie</surname></persName>, and the <rs type="place">White Oak Road</rs>; <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>, the <orgName type="mil" key="VeteranBrigade">Veteran Brigade</orgName>, of <num value="9">nine</num> regiments-lately my own-commanded now by <persName n="Edmunds,Colonel,,,," id="n0010.0009.00288.01998" reg="mostcommon:Edmunds,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Edmunds</surname></persName> of the <num value="22">22</num> <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, was placed at <placeName reg="Sutherland's Station">Sutherland's Station</placeName>, which covered the fields of the <rs type="place">Quaker Road</rs>, <placeName reg="Armstrong's Mill">Armstrong's Mill</placeName>, <placeName reg="Hatchers Run, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2380059">Hatcher's Run</placeName>, and of many minor fights on the left of our old entrenched lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>It was familiar ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>It was painful to be brought into contact with the ruin, waste, and desolation that had been wrought upon proud old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and her once prosperous homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>Well were they reluctant to declare themselves foes of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>; dearly had they paid for the distinction when the <rs>Confederacy</rs> demanded that its defiance to the <rs>Union</rs> should be enforced under their prestige and entrenched upon their soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>Settling into our new position we soon found that obeying orders was not the whole of our duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>To be sure the war was not yet over by official recognition; but these suffering people were our own,citizens of our common country we had fought to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>Had they not been so, humanity and honor would have commanded our aid. Peace indeed there was on all the face of the country,the desolation that has been called a <quote><name>Roman</name> peace.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>But the inhabitants we had to defend against lawlessness and violence, and save them from starvation and despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>Since the breaking up of the rebel lines, <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> before, the whole region had been a scene of marauding upon the defenseless citizens, who were unable to remove to any other place than this, which they had still <pb id="p.289" n="289"/> to call their home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>The depraved and soulless take advantage of others' misery, and make the day of calamity their holiday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>Such had been the case at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> but a few weeks before, when, freed from the control of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00289.01999" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, it was pillaged and fired by the base hidden within its limits, and it was humane conquerors who restored order and repaired hurt and harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>We found the negroes especially unruly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>All restraints which had hitherto held them in check were set loose by the sudden collapse of the rebel armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>The floodgates were opened to the rush of animal instinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>The only notion of freedom apparently entertained by these bewildered people was to do as they pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>That was what they had reason to suppose white men did. To act according to each <num value="1">one</num>'s nature was liberty, contrasted with slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>Numbers gave them a kind of frenzy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>Without accustomed support, without food, or opportunity to work, they not unnaturally banded together; and without any serious organization and probably without much deliberate plotting of evil, they still spread terror over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/>They swarmed through houses and homes demanding food, seizing all goods they could lay their hands on, abusing the weak, terrifying women, and threatening to burn and destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>This was an evil that had to be met promptly, and we construed our orders to protect the country liberally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>So the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">First Brigade</orgName> under <persName n="Sniper,Colonel,,,," id="n0010.0009.00289.02000" reg="mostcommon:Sniper,Gustave,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Sniper</surname></persName> was sent out charged with the duty of protecting the homes of the people, and the peace of the community, more <pb id="p.290" n="290"/> especially against the depredations of the lawless negro bands, of whom there were about a <num value="1000">thousand</num> within my jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>For our lines were extensive in depth as well as length, somewhat to the confusion of ordinary geometry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>A constant reconnoissance was going on to break up, drive off, or hold at bay the hordes that were hovering about the towns and farm-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>In cases of personal violence or outrage, my orders were sharp, and the process more summary than that authorized by courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>There was no other way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>Meantime the condition of the citizens of that region had excited the attention of our authorities, and much correspondence had been going on. Orders hitherto had forbidden us to furnish food for citizens unless they took the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>But conditions compelled us sometimes to take responsibility not strictly authorized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>I had adopted some measures of a domestic character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was in the commissary's and quartermaster's departments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>The lack of food among the people was a condition which laid on us an imperative duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>We had seized, of course, all the commissary's supplies belonging to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and distributed them among the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>I felt obliged now to take under control all the necessities of life to whomsoever belonging, both for protection and for judicial distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/><persName n="Mills,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00290.02001" reg="mostcommon:Mills,nomatch:0"><surname>Mills</surname></persName>, shops, and stores were also taken under control and put in operation, and the products distributed according to need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>Strict accounts were kept; debits and credits carefully <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> adjusted to the parties concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>Abandoned vehicles, implements, and animals, chiefly Confederate property, were seized and put in the hands of those who could make use of them for livelihood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>We also had to undertake the administration of justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>There were no courts, or municipal or police officers, exercising functions in that region; in fact no semblance of authority, human or divine, except our own. We had no civil jurisdiction; we acted under the laws of war,--not of martial, but of military law, which admits of some discretion on the part of its responsible agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>It is said: <quote>Necessity knows no law</quote> ; but it compelled us to make them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>There was a great back country around us. Demoralized relics and stragglers from both the <rs>Confederate</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> armies were coming in, and became for a time our guests, voluntary or involuntary, according to behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Complaints were constant from civil and military sources as to the misbehavior of some of these men. Now and then charges were brought against our own men. These cases must be disposed of. Otherwise our <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">provost guard</orgName> would be swamped with prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>So a division court-martial was duly organized, with <persName n="Pearson,General,,,," id="n0010.0009.00291.02002" reg="mostcommon:Pearson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pearson</surname></persName> as president.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>This was in effect at least a tribunal of justice, and it inspired respect, as well as compelled obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>The court, ably conducted, was very careful in its procedure and its decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>It came to be looked upon as a legitimate if not legal authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>Citizens high and low were often the complainers, and, assuming the power to summon witnesses and cause attendance, <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> we could generally discover the real culprit or delinquent, who preferred, to accept our decision rather than risk himself away from our protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>The queer thing about our court was that its fame soon went abroad, and it was appealed to by many reputable citizens who could not otherwise settle their difficulties with their old servants or with each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>We did not undertake to settle questions of property, but only of conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>The records of that court must be very amusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>I do not think they all went to the archives at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>Nor would I quite wish to disclose all that came within my knowledge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>But we had <num value="1">one</num> constant difficulty no reconnoissance or court could settle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>Our Government authorized the issue of food from our commissary stores absolutely necessary for the sustenance of citizens; but only on the condition, to be strictly enforced, that the beneficiaries should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> take the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>Many of our clients gave this rather too promptly for the satisfaction of our solemn justiciary of the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">commissary department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/>There was a misgiving &mdash; not to indulge a pun-lest people who had been calling the <rs>Yankees</rs> all the bad names they could hit upon, were altogether too easy in accepting favors of them, and in their new kind of swearing towards the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>For my own part, I had not this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>I believed there was more genuineness in this declaration of allegiance than in their real loyalty to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>Very many felt that they had been drawn into this by a <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> play upon their State pride and the example of great men whom they revered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>In truth it was a grave responsibility they took upon themselves, these leading minds, in issues so deep-reaching and effects so disastrous to the well-being of a State honored and beloved by us all for its part in the making of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>Some cases of this oath-taking drew their own peculiar meed of tender regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/><num value="1">One</num> such was reported to me by our young provost marshal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/>A young lady of finest manners had ridden to our headquarters, followed by a servant on a mule bearing a coarse bag, which she earnestly desired to have filled with materials for food, if nothing more than potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>The story of her home was enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Our <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>, who kept our oaths for us, told her of the requirement, and demanded this acknowledgment, asking her to kiss the book in token.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>To both of these suggestions she opposed a very firm determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>Indeed, considering the aspect of these <num value="2">two</num> respective objects, I would not have blamed her if she preferred to reverse the directions, swear to the book and kiss the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Her charming and coquettish ways, indicating a habit of easy conquest, caused an aesthetic efflorescence among the emotional susceptibilities of this personage, and so melted the firm face of his official habit, that he did not consider himself wholly fit for duty, and came to me stating the case, and asking if he might bring the reluctant petitioner for a hearing before me. Of course I assented, notwithstanding his remark that she was considered <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> the belle of <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111478">Dinwiddie</placeName>, and the fact that I was not then on the superannuated list myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>Her graceful bearing as she entered my tent, composed manner of address, and I must add her beauty as she adjusted herself to our courtesies, left me no doubt of her status,--whatever might be my own. My guests took <num value="2">two</num> camp chairs placed at an angle from my center of about <num value="60">sixty</num> degrees, which I believe is the frost angle, perhaps salutary here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>I could not but be amused at their mutual bearing in stating the case in which they were presumed to be antagonist parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>It would be an infelicity in language to say my young officer was demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>On the contrary, all the moral emotions &mdash; that is to say, the spiritual &mdash; were at a sublime exaltation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>But it was a comical sight when in their presentation of the case, they exchanged glances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>Her air was that of an injured party, and he the aggressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2837"/>At every soft impeachment his color rose to the <name>Jacqueminot</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2838"/>He was a handsome fellow; there were <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">united states</placeName> to which she might be ready to take the oath of allegiance, where the vitalizing function in testimony of loyal devotion would not be sustained by a book. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2839"/>The captivating client stated her case with Ciceronian skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2840"/>She said it was unreasonable to require her to entertain a feeling of duty and allegiance to the <quote>North,</quote> while her brothers and all her manly friends were in the <rs>Southern</rs> service; and that it was cruel, if not more deeply immoral, to demand the form of such a declaration when she could not give it heartily or truly; moreover, to <pb id="p.295" n="295"/> take advantage of her distress to demand what was immoral and impossible, did not accord with her ideal of chivalrous gentlemen. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2843"/><quote>That is my present intention,</quote> was the demure reply, which allowed a little <quote>leeway</quote> for the possibilities now sublimating the faculties of the ingenuous youth, her duty-bound opponent. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2851"/>The fair conqueror, triumphant in her refutation of the slanderous pronouncement that <quote>the woman who deliberates is lost,</quote> steps forward, bends over the book deftly covered with a fold of her soft handkerchief,--both held in the trembling hand of the young officer, who balances himself with such extremely Delsartian proneness that he does not seem to fear it if he should fall completely forward,--and the saving oath is taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2852"/>With what mental reservation, or spiritual committals, the defective records of earth do not show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2853"/>There was, however, a lingering twilight of the transaction in the fact that there was immediately a daily unaccountable diminution among the finer delicacies of our private headquarters' mess-stores; and that on moonlight evenings there was as item of the report, <quote>present but not accounted for,</quote> concerning the horse and also the material personality of our provost marshal; both of whom had undoubtedly passed into a state which science taking refuge in electrical metaphysics denominates <quote>the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> dimension.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2854"/><pb id="p.297" n="297"/> </p> 
<p>We were kept very busy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2855"/>Even the relief of duty from <persName n="Sutherland,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00297.02003" reg="mostcommon:Sutherland,nomatch:0"><surname>Sutherland</surname></persName>'s to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> left us <measure n="17miles" type="distance">seventeen miles</measure> to care for, and enlarging duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2856"/>Our numbers were increasing rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2857"/>Not only were many men belonging to our command recalled from detached service to their regiments but <num value="1800">eighteen hundred</num> convalescents and recruits belonging to the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> reported themselves at <persName n="Sutherland,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00297.02004" reg="mostcommon:Sutherland,nomatch:0"><surname>Sutherland</surname></persName>'s to be cared for there and thence distributed to their proper commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2858"/>The troops and garrisons at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> were also assigned to the corps and finally taken up in <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Ayres,,,,," id="n0010.0009.00297.02005" reg="mostcommon:Ayres,nomatch:0"><surname>Ayres</surname></persName>' Division</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2859"/>We certainly had all the responsibility we could well exercise; and we had now a pretty solid and efficient corps, which we took pleasure in keeping up in discipline and character, and in as good spirits as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2860"/>Near the end of the month notice came to us that we were to prepare to move and to start for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="-05-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2861"/>It may be a trace of that curious paradox in the human heart which makes us love those who have been a care and trouble to us, that the thought of leaving these stricken and helpless people brought as much sorrow to some of us as the thought of going home did of joy. Indeed what is home in deepest truth, but the place where by our thought and toil and tender care we are able to promote the well-being of others?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2862"/>Is not that satisfaction love's best support and toil's best reward?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2863"/>We are made and meant to care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2864"/>And where we have given of our best, even if unavailing, there the heart holds a certain treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2865"/>There was here, too, a pleasant <pb id="p.298" n="298"/> counterpart of this sentiment when the people among whom we had exercised this autocratic power learned of our near departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2866"/>Our domination had been but for a little while but our points of contact with the people had been many and close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2867"/>And we had made our rule of conduct towards each other such as was befitting those who were to live together as fellow-citizens in peace and good will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2868"/>On <num value="1">one</num> of those last fair <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct> mornings I received a formal visit from a deputation whose personal appearance, bearing, and manner wore a solemnity almost religious in suggestion, but betokening high character and sincere purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2869"/>They announce themselves as a delegation appointed by the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,1002336" n="1.000 10" reg="dinwiddie, virginia, united states">Dinwiddie County</placeName> to tender me a public dinner in testimony of what they were pleased to characterize as judicious management and kindly spirit in dealing with the confused elements and powers of that difficult situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2870"/>While a certain incongruity between the spiritual motive and the material constituence of their proffer might be conducive to a smile, yet there were elements in its seriousness which commanded sentiments even deeper than respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2871"/>However much their approving feeling may have overpassed their material means of expression, the proffer sprang from generous and noble sentiments exercised under trying conditions and was a testimony which it was an honor to receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2872"/>Literal acceptance of the compliment, however, was not to be thought of. But all the more my response should <pb id="p.299" n="299"/> show sincere appreciation and even more than common courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2950"/>At about midnight when the tired camp was still, the sentinel in front of my bivouac spoke nervously, saying there was something strange going on about my horse not far away in rear of us. He had been hastily tethered there amidst a little growth of scrubby pines, so near, and the place so quiet, there seemed to be no need of a guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2951"/>The boy who cared for him had dropped down near by in a swoon of sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2952"/>I rose and went out myself; and before I reached him my foot crushed through the breast-bones of a body half buried by the fallen <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> pine-cones and needles so long undisturbed, now gone back mostly ashes to ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2953"/>I found that the horse, pawing the earth within the scope of his picket-rope, had rolled out <num value="2">two</num> skulls and scattered the bones of bodies he had unearthed, and was gazing at the white skulls as if lost in doubt; now and then snorting to call others to solve the mystery, or swaying at his tether as if to get away himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2954"/>It was a weird, uncanny scene: the straggling, uncompanionable pines; the night brooding still and chill; black lowering clouds, now massing, now rifting, disclosing, then shutting out of sight, the white skulls mocking life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2955"/>The horse was not easily pacified,--not until I had gathered up the menacing skulls and the outlying limbs too, and laid them where I saw glimmering amidst the dusky d6bris of the pines other bones as if adrift on a Sargasso sea, and showed him that I was not afraid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2956"/>In the morning the men got to looking around among the bodies and relics, and by initials cut into the breast-plates or other marks or tokens identified the remnants of bodies of comrades long left among the missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2957"/>As we were not to move until <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, they asked permission to gather up these mournful remnants and pack them in the empty cracker-boxes in our supply trains, to be sent to friends who would gladly cherish even such tokens of the fate of the unreturning brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>But here we were, marched as hard as if we were a forlorn hope, or a Lucknow relief, hurled in for life and death-only going to be mustered out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3406"/>A feeling of comradeship and admiration rather than anything of jealousy or disposition for invidious comparison took many of us over to witness that grand spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3425"/>Further evidence of the liberality of their commanders in yielding something to the spirit of liberty, or at least to the instinct so significantly planted in man to establish relations with the kingdoms or subjects of nature supposed to be below him, appeared in the tokens of personal freedom allowed the men in the midst of their military discipline and the formalities of this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3453"/>He did not hesitate to affirm that his army was superior to ours in drill and discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>In precisely these points we could not agree with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3455"/>But I think the <rs>General</rs> made too wide an inference from the narrow field of his observed instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3456"/>If comparisons are to be instituted, it may be that in marching his troops surpassed ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3457"/>That had been a large part of their business; our occupations had been more varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3458"/>We had done some running on several occasions, and a good deal of fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3480"/>Such is the strange nature,--the human, likeness of interest holding masses together for the attainment of a great common cause, in which they show both loyalty and amity; but differences on a narrower scale, quickly throw men into an attitude quite antagonistic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3481"/>It must be said that this hostile feeling towards the <rs>East</rs> was not a general sentiment among our Western comrades, but only of a certain class accustomed to put their individualistic sentiments into execution more frequently and energetically than their sense of loyalty to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3482"/>For our part, surely, we had no dislike to Western men, but quite the contrary, as very many of them bore close relationship to our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> families; and as to the merits of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0010.0012.00373.02372" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> we did not hesitate to do it justice or give it sincere and generous praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3488"/>It was fair that these veterans should be allowed to take to their homes the arms they had honored, and permission was given them to purchase at a nominal value, it would not have been too much if the <rs>Government</rs> had granted these with such proud associations, to cheer the soldier in his resumed citizenship, rather than consign them to rust and oblivion in government stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3489"/>What I think very reprehensible was the practice permitted of selling overcoats at a cheap rate among workmen willing to buy them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3492"/>The men were kept at such work, whether of drill or other military duty, as the situation allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3493"/>But it will be understood that it was no easy matter to keep things smooth, when so many men were congregated, and the imperative motive for discipline and good order was overpassed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>The visitors became embarrassing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>It was well and it was pleasant to afford to soldiers and their friends an opportunity to compare the methods of army life and home life.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>On the other hand, visits of our officers and men to the city soon became a feature of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>Fair attractions across the river, dinners, parties, receptions, and other social entertainments, broke in upon the monastic habits of even the higher officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>A pleasant evening found most of them on the civil side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3505"/>We could not understand why the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> was so broken up and buffeted about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3518"/>We were left to <pb id="p.379" n="379"/> our own opinions on these unanswered questions,and we took them home with us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/><num value="1">One</num> question frequently brought to our minds by outside inquirers was whether from our observation and experience we regarded <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00379.02387" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> as a great general,--particularly in comparison with <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00379.02388" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,Hugh,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. While our opinion could in no degree affect the reputation of either of these generals, it might disclose our own competency as judges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3520"/>Hence, as these memoirs are supposed to reflect the intellectual as well as the military character of our soldiers, it may be proper to express what I understood to be their sentiment on this question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3521"/>But <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> let us understand the meaning of our principal term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3522"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> conceptions of great generalship: <num value="1">one</num> regarding practical material effects; the other essential personal qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3523"/>In the former view we regard <persName n="Attila,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00379.02389" reg="mostcommon:Attila,nomatch:0"><surname>Attila</surname></persName>, Genghis Khan, and Tamerlane as great generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3524"/>In the latter conception,--that of intrinsic qualities,--there are <num value="2">two</num> views to be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3525"/>This rank may be accorded to <num value="1">one</num> who has the ability to accomplish great things with moderate means, and against great disadvantages; of this <name>William</name> of <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName> is an example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3526"/>Or, on the other hand, it may be applied to <num value="1">one</num> who can command the situation, gather armies, control resources, and conquer by main force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3527"/>Examples of this are familiar in history: <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00379.02390" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00379.02391" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00379.02392" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3528"/>A current and I think correct definition of great generalship regards not so much the power to command resources, or the conditions of a grand <pb id="p.380" n="380"/> theater of action, as the ability to handle successfully the forces available, be they small or great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3529"/>And this, it will be seen, involves many qualities not readily thought of as military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>Among these is economy in the expenditure of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3531"/>Another is foresight, the ability to count the cost beforehand and to discriminate between probabilities and possibilities,--prudence might be the word for this, did it not border on hesitation, which has wrecked some reputations, if it has made others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>There is also astuteness, the ability to judge characters and the probable action of an adversary in given conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3533"/>And we may add humanity, regard for the well-being of the men employed in military operations, which might come also under the head of economics. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3534"/>Having thus considered the qualities involved in the term generalship, we will take up our opinion of the title to it on the part of the <num value="2">two</num> opposing generals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3536"/>He saw what was to be done, and he set himself to do it, without being much controlled by consideration of cost or probabilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3537"/>His mechanical calculations often failed to hold good,--flank movements were often belated, and so anticipated and neutralized by the enemy's vigilance and celerity; direct front attacks often proved direful miscalculation and murderous waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>Great cost of human life involved in a proposed plan was not taken into the reckoning beforehand; though regretted afterwards, it was not given weight in laying plans following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/><pb id="p.381" n="381"/> Though he studied lines of operations, foresight was not a characteristic of his; the resolve to do overbore all negations, and obliterated the limits of the possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>He so bent his energies on the main object ahead that he did not consider the effect of subordinate movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>He never seized the moment to turn disaster into victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>He seemed to rely on sheer force, rather than skillful manoeuvre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>He was rather critical in his estimates of subordinates; but did not study sufficiently the abilities and temperaments of his antagonists; so he was sometimes out-generaled &mdash; we do not like to say outwitted-by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>We would rather say he was checkmated by his own moves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>He was tender-hearted, but did not admit that sentiment into his military calculations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>We could see why he wanted <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00381.02395" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Phil,,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> and not <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00381.02396" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> for his executive officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>But for all this, and perhaps because of it, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00381.02397" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was necessary to bring that war to a close, whether by triumph of force or exhaustion of resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>His positive qualities, his power to wield force to the bitter end, must entitle him to rank high as a commanding general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>His concentration of energies, inflexible purpose, unselfishness, patience, imperturbable long-suffering, his masterly reticence, ignoring either advice or criticism, his magnanimity in all relations, but more than all his infinite trust in the final triumph of his cause, set him apart and alone above all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>With these attributes we could not call him less than great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/><pb id="p.382" n="382"/> </p> 
<p>Then looking at the question on another side, the great scale of action and its incalculable results, we shall find this judgment abundantly corroborated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>He had a great problem before him, involving issues which the wrestlings of nations and of ages had left unsolved,--the confirmation of a new world in its service to mankind and the purposes of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00382.02398" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Lewis,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was a chosen minister of the <name>Divine</name> will, and in a manner was the responsible agent for the execution of this vast design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>He doubtless felt this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>And what was revealed from on high he realized in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>What other men could not do, he did. And to <num value="1">one</num> who did this, to <num value="1">one</num> who led these mighty hosts to mighty ends, we must accord the rank of great, whether as general or as man. This is the verdict of those who were witnesses,servants and sufferers,--and it is our proud remembrance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>Our estimate of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0010.0013.00382.02399" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,Hugh,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was that he exemplified remarkable ability as a commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>In military sagacity and astuteness we recognized his superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>In singleness of purpose, and patient persistence, like our own great commander, he was remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>In his constant care for his men, and especially in conduct after disaster, he won our respect and in some ways our sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>We regarded him as a master in military economy, making best use with least waste of material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>And in defensive operations we looked upon him as a skilful tactician, taking best advantage of a situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/><pb id="p.383" n="383"/> </p> 
<p>In offensive operations, however, involving strategic considerations, he seemed to us not to reach the ideal of generalship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>His <num value="2">two</num> positive operations in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, culminating in the <rs>Antietam</rs> and <rs>Gettysburg</rs> campaigns, must be accounted at best as failures, detracting, we must say, from the highest conception of military ability. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>At <placeName key="tgn,7016218" n="1.000 581" reg="antietam, washington, maryland">Antietam</placeName>, where he made us the attacking party, he showed his tactical skill in subjecting us to terrible losses; at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, where he chose to take the offensive, he showed much less of that skill; and the result in each instance reflects on his strategic ability, in not taking into account the probabilities in such an enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>However, in the main, considering the great responsibilities with which he was charged and the great difficulties which he had to meet and did meet so successfully and for so long a time, we cannot consider him as ranking less than great among generals, and of the best of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>As to personal qualities, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00383.02400" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,Hugh,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s utter unselfishness, in fact his whole moral constitution, appeared to us singularly fine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>In his high characteristics as a man he compelled admiration among those who knew him,--even as we did,--and he will command it for all the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>We do not consider these statements of characteristics as complete or conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>Whatever may be the general or permanent estimate as to the place of these great commanders, we simply record this testimony from our own point of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/><pb id="p.384" n="384"/> </p> 
<p>A consideration which had great influence on the habits of thought which go to confirm character, was the cause in which each side was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>On both sides we had been fighting for what we respectively held to be the nature of our political life as a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>On the <rs>Confederate</rs> side they were fighting for existing institutions, having historic warrant, and, as they claimed, constitutional warrant also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>As the war had to be carried on in the territory whence the challenge came, there was opportunity to make the gist of their cause very clear and expressible in quite concrete terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>They could say, for instance, that they were fighting for their homes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3577"/>On our side the same general principles were affirmed; but their application was not limited to the existing status or institutions; rather to guiding and germinant ideals: the expressed intent and purpose of our fathers in establishing the government of <num value="1">one</num> great people, and the inborn right of every human being to make the best of himself, and the duty of all to help him to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3578"/>That is indeed a high ideal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>It was night around us; but overhead were the stars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/>Things were in a chaos of transition; but the forward look was clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>If in these later days they have not yet been fully realized, these principles have been clearly reaffirmed, and our consecration has been made more binding by the priceless cost of the vindication. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3582"/>This vast concourse of citizen soldiers was now about to be broken up, its individual constituents <pb id="p.385" n="385"/> scattered widely over the land, to resume their part in the wholesome and helpful activities of social life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>Going forth from their homes at the call of a supreme duty, should they return home better or worse men than they went?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3584"/>It had been a careful and congenial effort of those charged with the care of the men in the field, not only to provide for their personal material comfort and well-being as far as possible under the circumstances, but also to encourage the keeping up and even the growth of the nobler qualities of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/>The narrow and rude life of the field in warfare, so far from the saving and salutary influences of home, does not tend to promote the highest personal elements of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3586"/>Not that this life necessarily leads to vice; but no doubt it gives place to negligence of the better social instincts, and thus tends to narrow and harden the better sensibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3587"/>Hence the great care that should be taken that our young men who sacrifice so much for the country's well-being shall suffer no detriment to their manly worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>Such care was manifest in the army life within our knowledge,--both in our army and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00385.02401" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,Hugh,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s, and presumably in others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>Then as to the reactionary effect of warfare on the participants,--in the first place we cannot accept <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0010.0013.00385.02402" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s synonym as a complete connotation or definition of war. Fighting and destruction are terrible; but are sometimes agencies of heavenly rather than hellish powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>In the privations and sufferings endured as well as in the strenuous action of battle, some of the highest <pb id="p.386" n="386"/> qualities of manhood are called forth,--courage, self-command, sacrifice of self for the sake of something held higher,--wherein we take it chivalry finds its value; and on another side fortitude, patience, warmth of comradeship, and in the darkest hours tenderness of caring for the wounded and stricken-exhaustless and unceasing as that of gentlest womanhood which allies us to the highest personality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>Such things belong to something far different from the place or sphere assigned in the remark of the eminent exemplar of the aphorism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>He was doubtless speaking of war in its immediate and proximate effects as destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>He did not mean to imply that its participants are demons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3594"/>As to that, we may say war is for the participants a test of character; it makes bad men worse and good men better. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3595"/>After a while we were not looked upon with such wondering interest as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3596"/>Nay,--we began to be feared as likely to be in the way of those who had a preemption right to civil favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3597"/>Now our camps were thinning; our army was melting away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3598"/>We too, in this fading camp, had opportunity to observe many things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3599"/>Most manifest and largely shown it was that not a few about the capital were sorry the war was over; for this took the <quote>soft snaps</quote> away from them, and the soft spots out from under them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3600"/>These persons soon pretended to be sole judges and champions of loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3601"/>There was a certain <persName n="Demetrius,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00386.02403" reg="mostcommon:Demetrius,nomatch:0"><surname>Demetrius</surname></persName> once who made silver shrines for <persName n="Diana,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00386.02404" reg="mostcommon:Diana,nomatch:0"><surname>Diana</surname></persName>, and did not like <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00386.02405" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> because his teaching disturbed this sinecure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3602"/>He <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> skillfully therefore turned the issue upon religious loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3603"/><quote>Not only is this, our craft, in danger to be set at nought,</quote> he cries, <quote>but also the temple of the great goddess <persName n="Diana,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00387.02406" reg="mostcommon:Diana,nomatch:0"><surname>Diana</surname></persName> would be despised, and her magnificence destroyed, whom all <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName> and the world worshipeth.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3604"/>And they all cried, <quote>Great is <persName n="Diana,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00387.02407" reg="mostcommon:Diana,nomatch:0"><surname>Diana</surname></persName> of the <name>Ephesians</name>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3605"/>There were some loud-mouthed <quote>patriots</quote> about the capital whose zeal was rooted in the opportunity given by the country's distress for their own personal greed, and whose part in the service had been to get government contracts, and furnish cheap meats and musty and wormy hardtack and shoddy clothing to our worn, suffering soldiers, and even defective arms elsewhere rejected, to fail them in the desperate moment of the country's defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3606"/>There were concerns there and in some of the loyal States who made it their business to furnish even <quote>bogus</quote> men,--men never born, and christened only by them in lists of fictitious names, sold to recruiting agents for towns trying to fill their quota of men for the depleted army in the darkest moment of the country's need,--and appropriate to themselves the high bounties paid by towns to <quote>avoid the draft.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3607"/>Under the loud professions of such as these, it was easy to see the real regret and disgust they felt when the country had won its deliverance and the war was over, and their opportunity gone, --until they could get a chance at new commissions and agencies in the whirlpool of reconstruction then setting in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3608"/>Disturbed at the thought that some deserving <pb id="p.388" n="388"/> soldiers might be found by the <rs>Government</rs> for places of trust and honor, these patriots began to detract and undermine, by suggestions of <quote>disloyalty,</quote> --an ambiguous phrase, meaning to them not blind following of some party chief and boss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3609"/>The story that could be written of these things &mdash; will not be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3610"/>Even the proofs have disappeared in the free opportunities for this so easily obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3611"/>It was well known to some of us that the records at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> had been rummaged and that documents important for truth and dangerous for pretenders had been withdrawn and doubtless destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3612"/>It came to our knowledge that even Treasury vouchers had been tampered with and the rascality undetected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3613"/>The Government was kind: it meant to be just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3614"/>But in its great burden of responsibilities it could not consider minor matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3615"/>The country had been saved; other interests must adjust themselves as best they could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3616"/>I feel that I must not omit to mention here a species of injustice which affected us within strictly military aspects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3617"/>I refer to the inconsiderate or reckless bestowal of brevets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3618"/>This was very unjust to merit as well as injurious as policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3619"/>We had seen considerable lack of equity in this matter before the close of the war in the unevenness of scale on which different commanders secured brevets for their subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3620"/><num value="1">One</num> result of this was the relative injustice among those holding similar commands in different corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3621"/>Warmhearted generals like <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0010.0013.00388.02408" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Phil,,,:1"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> would be generous <pb id="p.389" n="389"/> in their recommendation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3622"/>Others of a severer temperament would move more slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3623"/><persName n="Humphreys,,Clearseeing,,," id="n0010.0013.00389.02409" reg="default:Humphreys,Clearseeing,,,"><foreName>Clearseeing</foreName> <surname>Humphreys</surname></persName>, just and zealous for truth, protested against this inequality and tried to resist it, by recommending only for distinguished merit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3624"/>But the key-note had been set; and to grant brevets for merit only would work practical injustice considering that others had been so promoted on other grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3625"/>I have to confess that in some vexation of spirit I resolved to keep up with the best in recommending this honor for the officers of my division at the close of the war. But in the meantime the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was adopting this sweeping policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3626"/>Everybody was breveted <num value="1">one</num> grade who asked for it,<num value="1">one</num> <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> embracing very many ranking at <num value="1">one</num> and the same date, which being arbitrarily fixed at a time previous to the heavy fighting of the last campaign, antedated the commissions of several who had won that honor as a special distinction in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3627"/>The meaning of the brevet is honorable distinction; this leveled all distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3628"/>It destroyed the value of the brevet as recognition of past service or incentive for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3629"/>There were those who had won their brevets while the life blood ran from their veins, at the deadly front, only to find themselves now equaled, parodied, outranked even, by their own subordinates and men who had scarcely seen the field at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3630"/>I may remark that being included in that general list referred to, although I had not asked for it or in any manner suggested it, I declined this <pb id="p.390" n="390"/> brevet, but in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> battle of the last campaign receiving the brevet of <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> for special service reported by my corps commander, I did not officially accept the latter until we reached <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and the army was about to be mustered out. So this brevet was not officially recognized by the <rs>Government</rs> in the final orders for the disbandment of the army and my assignment to another corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3631"/>In truth I did not feel it now as a token of honor or an object of desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3632"/>The Government, however, thereupon sent me the later commission, which purported to be something worth receiving with responsive regard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3633"/>Only the <quote>Congressional Medal of honor</quote> had been held sacred,--not to be bought or sold, or recklessly conferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3634"/>It was held to be the highest honor,--recognition of some act of conspicuous personal gallantry beyond what military duty required.
