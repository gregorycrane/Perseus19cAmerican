<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Some time during the night preceding the explosion, our brigade received orders to be <q direct="unspecified">ready to move at a moment's warning,</q> which, of course, indicated that something was expected requiring a movement of the command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>It was well understood that the enemy were mining somewhere on our line, but exactly at what point was not known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>A counter-mine was made by the <rs>Confederates</rs> several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> to the right of the <name>Crater</name>, near the point at which the <rs>Confederate</rs> breastworks cross the <name>Jerusalem</name> plank-road, as may be seen at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>At the <name>Elliott</name> salient a counter-mine was begun, but was abandoned for want of proper tools.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The explosion took place between daybreak and sunrise (<time value="4:44am">4:44 A. M.</time> was the exact time), and the impression made upon those hearing it may be likened to that of a nearly simultaneous discharge of several pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The concussion of the atmosphere was unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>We were all soon in the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Something extraordinary, we knew, had happened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Soon a report came down the line from the direction of the scene of action that a mine had been exploded and a part of our works blown up and was occupied by the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I rode rapidly to <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00032" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName>'s line, and delivered my message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He immediately gave orders to the commanders of the <rs>Virginia</rs> and <rs>Georgia</rs> brigades to move to the sailent and report to <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00033" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bushrod,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The troops moved promptly, the <rs>Virginia</rs> brigade (<persName n="Weisiger,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00034" reg="nearbymention:Weisiger,D.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Weisiger</surname></persName>) in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We rode on together, at the head of the column, <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00035" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName> giving instructions to his officers and inquiring as to the condition of things at the sailent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>When we reached the peach orchard, in rear of the <rs type="place">Ragland House</rs>, noticing that the men were encumbered with their knapsacks, he halted the column, and caused both brigades to put themselves in battle trim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>While the men were throwing aside their knapsacks he turned to me and said: <quote>I can't send my brigades to <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00036" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bushrod,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>&mdash;I will go with them myself.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He then moved the column towards the opening of the covered way, which led to the <name>Crater</name> salient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I left him at this point to report to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00037" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,Edward,,:45"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who, meantime, had come to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I found him sitting with <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00038" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, among the men in the lines, at a traverse near the <rs type="place">River</rs> salient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When I told him of the delivery of the message, and that <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00039" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName> had concluded to lead the <num value="2">two</num> brigades himself, he expressed gratification.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/></p> 
<p>Leaving the <rs type="place">Ragland House</rs>, we marched along the edge of the hills skirting <persName n="Run,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0276.0002.00005.00040" reg="mostcommon:Run,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Run</surname></persName> to <address><street n="New Road">New Road</street></address>, or <address><street n="Hickory street">Hickory street</street></address>, and entered this road a <num value="100">hundred</num> or <num value="2">two</num> more yards east of the brigade, then marched westwardly to within a few yards of the bridge over this run, and then filed northwardly down the ravine on the east side of <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> the run to <persName n="Hannon,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00041" reg="mostcommon:Hannon,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannon</surname></persName>'s (now <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s) old ice-pond; here entered a military foot-path leading along the pond eastward to the head of the pond; thence filed eastwardly up a ravine along the same military foot-path to the <name>Jerusalem</name> plank-road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We are now at a point a few feet from the southwestern corner of the <rs type="place">Jewish cemetery</rs> of to-day, and the position of the foot-path in this ravine along which we came is yet plainly marked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At the plank-road we are halted and counter-march by regiments, thereby placing each regiment with its left in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Here we see on the roadside, <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00042" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName>, with other officers, dismounted, their horses standing near by. <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00043" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName> had then reported to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00044" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,G.,T.,,:11"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> at the headquarters of <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00045" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bushrod,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, which were at the old house, which, until a few years ago, stood on the crest of the hill a short distance northwest from the northwest corner of <placeName reg="Blandford Cemetery">Blandford Cemetery</placeName> and near the road leading southwardly up the hill to the cemetery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It was now about <time value="8:30oclock">half-past 8 o'clock</time>, and the enemy were just as they had been for nearly <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>, in quiet occupation of the <name>Crater</name>, with about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of our breastworks to the south and some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of these works to the north of the <name>Crater</name>, reaching down to the foot of the hill on the north side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>To these limits on either side the <rs>Confederates</rs> occupying the lines <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> of the <name>Crater</name> confined them.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Ascending the little knoll at the point where the ravine is entered by another smaller ravine or gully, into which the zig-zag covered way led and terminated, he sees the <rs>Confederate</rs> works filled to overflowing with Federal troops, and, counting <num value="11">eleven</num> regimental flags, estimates the <rs>Federal</rs> force in possession as at least <num value="3000">3,000</num> men. The situation is an extremely grave <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>His own little force of <num value="2">two</num> brigades, then approaching in the covered way, if assailed in this position, would be inevitably cut to pieces and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>So <persName n="Mahone,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00047" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><surname>Mahone</surname></persName> orders <persName n="Blakemore,,Courier,J.,H.," id="n0276.0002.00006.00048" reg="default:Blakemore,Courier,J.,H.,"><foreName>Courier</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Blakemore</surname></persName> to go at once back and bring up the <rs>Alabama</rs> brigade (<persName n="Saunders,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00049" reg="nearbymention:Saunders,J.,C.,C.,"><surname>Saunders</surname></persName>') to come by the same route which the <rs>Virginia</rs> and <rs>Georgia</rs> brigades had taken.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Whilst <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n0276.0002.00006.00050" reg="nearbymention:Mahone,William,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName> is at the knoll surveying the enemy and arranging for the attack, we are cautiously approaching the ravine along the covered way. At the angles, where the enemy could see a moving column with ease, the men are ordered to run quickly by, <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> <num value="1">one</num> man at a time; which was done for the double purpose of concealing the approach of a body of troops and of lessening the danger of passing rifle balls at these exposed points.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I particularly noticed in the hands of <num value="1">one</num> of the frightened creatures the new silk of a large and beautiful stand of colors, the staff swaying to and fro as the color-bearer, his eyes fixed in terrified gaze at his armed adversaries, was being pushed and jostled by his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Casting my eyes upon the ground over and beyond the breastworks&mdash;east of them, I mean&mdash;I there saw large numbers of the enemy retreating to their own breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Many, however, were taking shelter behind&mdash;that is, on the east side, or outside, of our breastworks, as I could see from the tops of their caps, just over the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Into a squad of those I saw retreating to their own works, I fired my rifle, and not stopping to note the damage done by my shot, or to enquire who was thereby hurt, I jumped into <num value="1">one</num> of the little ditches leading out from the main trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>This ditch was about as deep as I was high and about <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> wide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>As may be imagined, I was now in quite a predicament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>What should I do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Shoot the fellow I could not&mdash;my gun, having been just fired, was empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Bayonet him I could not, as I had no bayonet on my gun. I had lost my bayonet at the <rs n="Battle of the Wilderness" type="battle">battle of the Wilderness</rs>, and glad of having done so, as I was thus lawfully relieved of that much weight on a march, I had never bothered myself about getting another, never having expected to get close enough to an armed enemy to need it. Nor could I club this man; the narrowness of the ditch prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Nor could I turn my back upon him with safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>But there was a protecting hand to save me. Just in front of me, and to my right, was a large recess in the earth, perpendicular to the little ditch in which I stood and parellel to the main ditch or trench, large enough for a horse to stand in&mdash;say <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> in length, <num value="4">four</num> in width and of the same depth with the little ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Into this recess, by a rapid stride to my front and right, I made my way, and there loaded my rifle in the quickest possible time; no muzzle-loader was ever loaded in less time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>I was now less than <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> from a trench full of Federal soldiers with arms in their hands, and was in a position critical and perilous in the extreme.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Ready now to give the enemy a shot, I looked around the corner towards the place near the intersection of the ditch with the trench where I saw the fellow who pointed his gun and grinned at me, but he was not to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>All I could see in this direction were the ends of rifles and bayonets held by men in the trench concealed from my view by the angle of the trench and small ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Whilst I was making this observation, a Federal soldier in the trench near this angle fired his gun, and its muzzle was close enough to the dry earthen angle to make the dust rise in the air as the wind of the exploding rifle-charge knocked away a part of the sharp corner of the trench and ditch at this angle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Finding in this direction nothing at which to shoot, although only a wall of some <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> intervened between the place where I stood and a ditch full of men in blue, I stood tip-toe and looked eastward towards the ground beyond our breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Here I saw numbers of the enemy crowding behind the outer or eastward part of our works, apparently <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> deep, the tops of their caps only being visible, and there were at the same time others of the enemy retreating across the open field between our works and theirs, and at these I fired this, my <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> shot, and again reloaded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>About this time a conference took place between <persName n="Turner,Comrade,,,," id="n0276.0002.00013.00089" reg="nearbymention:Turner,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Comrade">Comrade</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> and myself as to the propriety of remaining in the place where we then stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The suggestion was made that we fall back to our line, I mean that part of it represented by the <orgName n="Petersburg Riflemen" type="riflemen">Petersburg Riflemen</orgName>, all or the greater part of whom, we believed, were standing or lying at or near the ends of the ditches leading out from the trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>We agreed, however, that whilst we were in a very dangerous position, <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> it was our safest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Besides this, a backward movement, by even as few as <num value="2">two</num> men, might have started others, perhaps the whole line, to falling back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>So we concluded to remain where we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Had we attempted to fall back, we would have gone from a position in which we were comparatively safe (unless our whole line had been beaten back) to <num value="1">one</num> of great danger, and would probably have lost our lives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Both of us now fired several shots from this place&mdash;probably <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I then thought I would take an enfilading fire at the enemy in the trench to my right, who were in plain view, there being an angle in the breastworks to our right, the recess in which <persName n="Turner,Comrade,,,," id="n0276.0002.00014.00090" reg="nearbymention:Turner,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Comrade">Comrade</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> and myself stood being so located as to enable us, when on tip-toe, to look southeastwardly down the trench towards the <name>Crater</name>, some <measure n="75yards" type="distance">seventy-five yards</measure> to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>When taking a survey of this part of the trench I saw men struggling there, which indicated that some of our men opposite that part of the breastworks had effected an entrance therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Seeing this I determined to withhold my proposed shot down the trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Just at this time, looking to my left, I saw Federal soldiers coming out of, and many of our men passing into, the trench along the little ditch by which <persName n="Turner,Comrade,,,," id="n0276.0002.00014.00091" reg="nearbymention:Turner,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Comrade">Comrade</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> and myself had entered; whereupon I went at once into the trench into which the <rs>Confederates</rs> were now entering in numbers from the little ditches up and down the line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Casting my eyes up the line towards the <name>Crater</name> I saw Confederates beating and shooting at the negro soldiers, as the latter, terror-stricken, rushed away from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> negro running down the trench towards the place where several of us stood and a Confederate soldier just in his rear drawing a bead on him as he ran. The Confederate fired at the poor creature, seemingly heedless of the fact that his bullet might have pierced his victim and struck some of the many Confederates immediately in its range.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>A minute later I witnessed another deed which made my blood run cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Just about the outer end of the ditch by which I had entered stood a negro soldier&mdash;a non-commissioned officer (I noticed distinctly his chevrons)&mdash;begging for his life of <num value="2">two</num> Confederate soldiers, who stood by him, <num value="1">one</num> of them striking the poor wretch with a steel ramrod, the other holding a gun in his hand with which he seemed to be trying to get a shot at the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The man with the gun fired it at the negro, but did not seem to seriously injure him, as he only clapped his hand to his hip, where he appeared to have been shot, and continued to beg for his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The man with the ramrod continued <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> to strike the negro therewith, whilst the fellow with the gun deliberately reloaded it, and placing its muzzle close against the stomach of the poor negro, fired, at which the latter fell limp and lifeless at the feet of the <num value="2">two</num> Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It was a brutal, horrible act, and those of us who witnessed it from our position in the trench a few feet away could but exclaim: <q direct="unspecified">That is too bad!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is shocking!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Yet this, I have no doubt, from what I saw and afterwards heard, was but a sample of many other bloody tragedies during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> after our men got into the trench, many of whom seemed infuriated at the idea of having to fight negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Within these <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> the whole floor of the trench was strewn with the dead bodies of negroes, in some places in such numbers that it was difficult to make <num value="1">one</num>'s way along the trench without stepping upon them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But the works are not yet ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>To the north of the <name>Crater</name> and in the ditches immediately behind and west of it the <rs>Confederates</rs> were in possession; but the <name>Crater</name> itself is held by a large number of the enemy&mdash;several <num value="100">hundred</num> of them&mdash;not yet ready to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>There were also some <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of our works south of Crater in the enemy's possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>To drive out these, about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>&mdash;a little more than an hour after the charge made by the <rs>Virginia</rs> brigade&mdash; <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Wright,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00015.00092" reg="mostcommon:Wright,Ambrose:1:Augustus:1,R.,,:2"><surname>Wright</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> of Georgian's were ordered forward from the same ravine from which the <rs>Virginia</rs> charged; but such was the severity of the fire the men of this gallant brigade were forced to oblique to the left and take shelter among the works now in the hands of the <name>Virginians</name>, thus failing in their attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>When this charge was about to be made, the <name>Virginians</name> in the trench were notified and directed to fire upon the enemy in their front as rapidly as possible, in the language of the order, <q direct="unspecified">to keep their heads down</q>; an order which was obeyed with a will, as nearly every man standing in the trench was supplied with several guns&mdash;his own, and <num value="1">one</num> or more of the hundreds of captured guns which lay all along the trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Not only when the charge was made, but all of the time after our men got in the trench did they fire from our breastworks at the enemy whenever they showed themselves along the crest or rim of the <name>Crater</name>, as they constantly did, or whenever they attempted to run the gauntlet from the <name>Crater</name>, across the field to their own works, a movement which was attempted by many and by some successfully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>About the crest of the <name>Crater</name> next to the <rs>Federal</rs> lines might be seen sometimes a man from the outside climbing over to get within the <name>Crater</name>, and sometimes a man from the inside climbing over to get <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>I remember seeing a gallant Federal officer mount the edge of the <name>Crater</name> at this point, and, with conspicuous bravery, wave his glittering sword overhead, as if calling on his men to follow him&mdash;a sight which commanded my admiration, as it must have done that of all who witnessed it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>An incident occurred about this time, or a little later in the morning, that I have often recalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Happening in my immediate presence, it very deeply impressed me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Just at this time <persName n="Johnson,,Buck,,," id="n0276.0002.00016.00096" reg="default:Johnson,Buck,,,"><foreName>Buck</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, who had doubtless been engaged in the same way elsewhere, and who was never known to flinch, bearing a splendid reputation as a soldier, as, indeed, did <persName n="Tayleure,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00016.00097" reg="nearbymention:Tayleure,Sergeant,W.,W.,"><surname>Tayleure</surname></persName>, happened to be standing on the floor of the trench.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Poor Sacry's bleeding corps substituted profound seriousness in the place of angry words, and I believe the needless quarrel was never renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Both <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00016.00102" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Buck,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Tayleure,,,,," id="n0276.0002.00016.00103" reg="nearbymention:Tayleure,Sergeant,W.,W.,"><surname>Tayleure</surname></persName> served to maintain on several subsequent fields of battle the good name that each had already well won in their <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of active service.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Then the enemy sought shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The day was fearfully hot; the wounded were crying for water, and the canteens were empty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>A few of our troops held a ditch a few feet in front of the crater and were keeping up a brisk fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>In the little calm that followed, we loaded a large number of muskets and placed them in readiness for instant use. Another movement was soon attempted by the enemy, but our fire was so sharp that they hastily sought cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The works are surrendered, and the prisoners pour out, making their way back, however, under a severe fire from their own batteries, some of them falling on the way.</p>

<p>From this time, during the balance of the day, every thing is comparatively quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>I congratulated myself that I had no nearer connection with this disagreeable work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>In a big grave, not a <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> in rear of the <name>Crater</name>, a large number of the bodies were placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The work was done by a squad of negro prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Wherever he was announced to speak crowds thronged to hear him. He was impassioned, magnetic, fluent&mdash;at times almost choked with the rushing multitude of his words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>He had a high opinion of the oratorical art&mdash;of what he called a <q direct="unspecified">perfect speech.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Here, in a condensed form, was his idea of a great speech, as near as we can formulate it: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/></p> 
<p>A great speech is a great work of art, and all great works of art are the outcome of <num value="1">one</num> coherent, harmonious, well-proportioned whole&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> single conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>The all&mdash;important fundamental fault of most <q direct="unspecified">orations</q> is the failure to perceive this, or else the failure to act on the perception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>It is in oratory as it is in architecture and painting; there are certain features to be brought out in strong, bold prominence, and upon these all the forces at command may be lavished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>All other features are merely subsidiary and must be placed in abeyance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>In every great speech there are certain <q direct="unspecified">points</q> to be wrought up to, to be prepared for. It is only at these points that really great orators give full play to their powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>They reserve their strength, their voice, their language, their gesticulation, and all their passion for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Even here, <quote>in the very torrent, tempest and whirlwind of their passion,</quote> they must, if they are to rise to the very height of their great art, endeavor to <quote>acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Where you may find a <num value="100">hundred</num> men ready of tongue, fluent of action, able in argument, and solid in matter, you will not find more than <num value="1">one</num>, at the most, who can thus make all his powers combine in the production of a real work of art&mdash;a well-proportioned speech.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>He <pb id="p.51" n="51"/> had passed through a variety of scenes in life&mdash;scenes of romance and adventure&mdash;and had known much of pleasure and much of sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>He was at times bitterly sarcastic, and hence it was sometimes said that he wanted heart and generosity and kindness of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>But his was that sarcastic levity of tongue, <q direct="unspecified">the stinging of a heart the world hath stung.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>He was attended all his life after reaching manhood by an evil spirit, and it certainly speaks volumes for the strength of his intellect to say that, notwithstanding the almost omnipotent sway exercised over him by this evil spirit, and, at times, his abject bondage to its malign influence, he nevertheless became a brilliant and magnificient orator, an able and profound lawyer, and a far-seeing and sagacious statesman.</p></div2>

<p>Immediately in our front, and extending <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>, stretched a field, at the farther extremity of which was situated the dwelling and farm buildings of <persName n="Crew,Mister,,,," id="n0276.0003.00057.00510" reg="mostcommon:Crew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crew</surname></persName> (formerly <persName n="Mettert,Doctor,,,," id="n0276.0003.00057.00511" reg="mostcommon:Mettert,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Mettert</surname></persName>). In front and to our left the land rose gently from the edge of the woods up to the farm-yard, when it became high and rolling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Upon the right the field was broken by a series of ridges and valleys, which ran out at right angles to a line drawn from our position to that of the enemy, and all of which terminated upon our extreme right in a precipitous bluff, which dropped suddenly down upon a low, flat meadow, covered with wheat and intersected with a number of ditches, which ran from a bluff across the meadow to a swamp or dense woods about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure> farther to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>This low, flat meadow stretched up to and swinging around <placeName reg="Crew's house">Crew's house</placeName>, extended as far <placeName reg="Turkey Island, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2733032">Turkey Bend</placeName> on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>The enemy had drawn up his artillery <pb id="p.58" n="58"/> (as well as could be ascertained, about <num value="50">fifty</num> pieces) in a crescent-shaped line, the convex-line being next to our position, with its right (on our left) resting upon a road which passed <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> to the left of <placeName reg="Crew's house">Crew's house</placeName> on <placeName key="tgn,2489907" n="1.000 203" reg="malvern hill, charles city, virginia">Malvern Hill</placeName>, the left of their advanced line of batteries resting upon the high bluff which overlooked the meadow to the right (our right) and rear of <placeName reg="Crew's house">Crew's house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>Their infantry, a little in rear of the artillery, and protected by the crest of the ridge upon which the batteries were placed, extended from the woods on our left along the crest of the hill and through a lane in the meadow on our right to the dense woods there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>In rear of this and beyond a narrow ravine, the sides of which were covered with timber, and which ran parallel to their line of battle and but a few rods in rear of <placeName reg="Crew's house">Crew's house</placeName>, was another line of infantry, its right resting upon a heavy, dense woods, which covered the <rs type="place">Malvern Hill farm</rs> on the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The left of this line rested upon the precipitous bluff which overhung the low meadow on the west of the farm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>At this point the high bluff stretched out to the west for <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in a long ridge or ledge, nearly separating the meadow from the lowlands of the river, upon the extreme western terminus of which was planted a battery of heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>The latter battery commanded the whole meadow in front of it, and by a direct fire was able to dispute the manoeuvring of troops over any portion of the meadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Just behind the ravine which ran in rear of <placeName reg="Crew's house">Crew's house</placeName>, and under cover of the timber, was planted a heavy battery in a small redoubt, whose fire swept across the meadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>These <num value="2">two</num> batteries completely controlled the meadow from <num value="1">one</num> extremity of it to the other and effectually prevented the movement of troops in large masses upon it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>Just at this time a solid shot fired from a gun of a Federal battery near <placeName reg="Crew's house">Crew's house</placeName>, now concealed from our view by an intervening body of woods, comes skipping along, nearly spent, narrowly missing the group of officers and couriers and passing through our ranks, opened for the purpose, as we saw it bounding slowly towards us &mdash; a reminder that the enemy was near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>All around the open field through which this shot came bounding towards us were pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>In the road in which we halted were long lines of troops, and the dashing-looking officer was no other than <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n0276.0003.00059.00520" reg="nearbymention:Magruder,J.,Bankhead,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>The men in the ranks understood this order to be to charge the battery that fired the shot, which, like a gauntlet thrown down, seemed to challenge our assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>In a few moments we are in motion, forming a line of battle with our faces in the direction of the <orgName n="Federal Artillery" type="artillery">Federal artillery</orgName>, whose fire seems now to increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Between us and the enemy intervenes the body of woods referred to, and we see nothing of them as we move forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>A <num value="100">hundred</num> or <measure n="2yards" type="distance">two yards</measure> of forward movement brings us into these woods&mdash;a body of large chestnuts and oaks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Through the tops of these tall trees, far above our heads, the shot and shell of the now vigorously-used <orgName n="Federal Artillery" type="artillery">Federal artillery</orgName> howl and crash, putting us in constant danger of injury from falling fragments of huge limbs of trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>But on we go, until we reach a ravine, or gully, along the bottom of which ran a small branch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>Here we halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>In the ravine is a brigade of troops, all sitting with their backs to the wall of the gully next to the enemy, seemingly secure from danger, ensconced, as they were, in what appeared to be comparatively a bomb-proof, and looking far more comfortable than we felt under an order to charge a battery and on our way to execute this order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>The occasion of our temporary <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> halt just here was an examination as to the route by which it would be best to go forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>In the dilemma, <num value="1">one</num> of the couriers attached to our regiment suggested to our colonel that we might go through a little gate in sight, a short distance to our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>The courier's suggestion is taken, and we move to our right and file through this gate, meeting, as we pass, a poor fellow with a bullet hole through his neck and the pallor of death on his face, his friends, as they bear him past us, saying, <q direct="unspecified">Look out for sharp-shooters</q>&mdash;another reminder, and not an agreeable <num value="1">one</num>, either, of the presence of our armed adversaries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>We are now very close to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>We are at the foot of the hill upon the table-ground of which stand the <rs type="place">Crew house</rs> and other buildings and <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0276.0003.00060.00523" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> awaiting our assault-so close that we feel the vibrations of the earth at each discharge of the <rs>Federal</rs> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Not <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> intervene between us and these guns, the slope of the hill, however, perfectly protecting us, we being now opposite to the extreme left of the <rs>Federal</rs> line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>To our right in a beautiful field (the meadow mentioned by <persName n="Wright,General,,,," id="n0276.0003.00060.00524" reg="nearbymention:Wright,Ambrose,R.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wright</surname></persName>), with its yellow shocks of recently-harvested wheat, are stationed the <rs>Federal</rs> sharp-shooters against whom we have been warned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Posted behind the shocks of wheat, they see us, but we cannot see them, whilst they pick off our men as they come up to take position in line of battle at the foot of the hill, preparatory to the intended charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>As each man files up he is ordered to lie down&mdash;an order most cheerfully obeyed, the recumbent position affording much protection from the fire of these sharpshooters, whose bullets are constantly hissing past us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>As I marched along to this position I looked over towards the woods on <placeName reg="Turkey Creek, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2732814">Turkey creek</placeName> skirting this meadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>The prospect was beautiful, and as my eye took in the landscape, with everything in that direction so tranquil that clear summer afternoon, and in such striking contrast with the harsh notes of war every <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reaching the ear from the hill in the front and to the left of us, I was reminded of a certain meadow in a neighboring county, which with its low grounds and fringe of dense woods, were delightfully familiar to me in the holiday seasons of my then recent boyhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The wheat shocks, the low grounds, the woods in the distance, now before me, seemed to duplicate in every particular those elsewhere located, and now vividly recalled, over which, with gun and dog, I had so often hunted, and with which I associated nothing but happiness, and a crowd of memories rushed upon me. This would not be a truthful <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> record if I did not here state that I would have gladly then and there ended the war, changed the situation of affairs and transferred myself to the scene of these memories, far away from the angry roar of hostile cannon.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>We rush up the slope of the hill towards the enemy, yelling at the top of our voices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Just as we near the brow of the hill, when my eye, on a level with them, takes in the field with its houses, I catch a glimpse of <num value="4">four</num> artillery horses hitched to a gun, or to a caisson, dashing away at full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>At the sight of this my heart leaped with joy. The enemy are flying!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Their artillery and infantry are routed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>We are victors without firing a gun!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>These were my thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>But I was terribly mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1332"/>I shall always remember with pleasure <num value="1">one</num> little incident connected with this affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1333"/>Several weeks before, as we had more men than were required or needed to man the guns, about <num value="60">sixty</num> of our company had been armed with rifles and acted with the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>When the train was halted and skirmishers thrown off, I was anxious to join them, and endeavored to get <num value="1">one</num> of the riflemen to exchange places with me. I knew he was disaffected, and it occurred to me that he would not hesitate to shirk danger; but I reckoned without my host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>He rejected the overture with some indignation, and remarked that if anybody had to use his rifle he proposed to do it himself; and I ascertained that he behaved as gallantly as any man. This but illustrates that it was not cowardice that caused a great many of our soldiers to waiver in their allegiance toward the close of the war, but the terrible hardships to which they were subjected, the <pb id="p.103" n="103"/> distressing accounts of suffering of their loved ones at home, and the intuitive knowledge that defeat was inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>I remember with sadness, without any feeling of censure, many instances of desertion of as brave men as ever marched to the tap of a drum.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2751"/>There is a pathos in this assemblage which will subdue any heart that duly considers its significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2752"/>The life of a generation has almost passed since the <num value="2">two</num> sections of this country were locked in deadly strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>It was a conflict which put to the test the strength and manhood of both the contending parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>Immense forces were put in the field, and were recruited as fast as they were depleted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>These, marching from either extreme, met in the centre with a force of encounter that caused the continent to tremble to its base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2756"/>It was a conflict gigantic in its proportions and heroic in its endurance&mdash;terminated at length only through the exhaustion of <num value="1">one</num> of the combatants, when the stained and battered banner must needs be furled upon its staff, and peace resume its gentle sway.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2757"/>During the <num value="6">six</num> and <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> which have elapsed nearly all the leaders in the stupendous struggle, both in council and in camp, have been summoned into the land of silence and of shadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>With the field-glass ranging over the whole plain of battle, the eye detects here and there only a single commander left, now bending under the weight of years and infirmity, who once led brave men to the fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>And of these few we meet to-night to mourn the departure of <num value="1">one</num> who was among the most conspicuous of them all. <pb id="p.211" n="211"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has its symbols no less than Grace&mdash;through which it gives shape and substance to the truths it would seal upon the minds and hearts of men. Of these impressive emblems nothing could be more suggestive than the consentaneous death of the <num value="2">two</num> commanders who were pitted against each other through a great part of this historic struggle&mdash;pre-eminently so in the memorable retreat from the mountains of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to the border of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and then northward through the <name>Carolinas</name> almost to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 20" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2761"/>I cannot here undertake to signalize this retreat, except to say it is difficult which most to admire, the prowess and energy of the advance, or the masterly, stragetic defence which retarded that advance and conducted an orderly retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2762"/>It was a retreat which will take its place in future history with that of the famous <num value="10000"><persName n="Thousand,,Ten,,," id="n0276.0009.00211.02404" reg="default:Thousand,Ten,,,"><foreName>Ten</foreName> <surname>Thousand</surname></persName></num> under <persName n="Xenophon,,,,," id="n0276.0009.00211.02405" reg="mostcommon:Xenophon,nomatch:0"><surname>Xenophon</surname></persName> from the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Babylon, White Pine, Nevada" key="tgn,2141869">Babylon</placeName> along the upper <rs>Tigris</rs>, through the mountains of <placeName reg="Kordestan" key="tgn,1001364">Kurdistan</placeName> and <placeName reg="Hayastan" key="tgn,7006651">Armenia</placeName>, to the <name>Greek</name> settlements upon the <name>Euxine</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>The whole nation stood in solemn silence when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these warriors, at an advanced age, breathed his soul into the hands of his Creator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>But when the <rs>Confederate</rs> chieftain, whom we mourn tonight, stood with an ungloved hand beside the bier of his formal rival and foe, performing the last act of earthly friendliness in reverently bearing the body to the repose of the tomb, a sublime object-lesson was furnished by an ordaining <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> to the entire republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>Then, as if the destinies of the <num value="2">two</num> were interblended to the last, he who had assisted at the funeral rites of the other reached home himself to die. And now the comrades and followers of this distinguished leader are assembled in the house of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in the solemn Sabbath hour when night has drawn her curtain around the earth, to gather the memories of the past into garlands, which shall be laid in affectionate reverence upon this new-made grave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2766"/>It appears to me almost a sacred inspiration, veterans, which prompted the observance of this memorial with religious rites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>Had it occurred in an earlier year, it would perhaps have called for a great civic demonstration, with all the pomp and circumstance of military display, disinterring the records of the past and throwing the furled banner again upon the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>But the instinct of reverence has brought you here, without the blare of trumpet or flash of armor, to sit between these twin graves and recognize the burial of an ancient feud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>That these <num value="2">two</num> warriors, almost the last who fought on either side, <pb id="p.212" n="212"/> should simultaneously sleep in death, marks this as an epoch in our career, when a new leaf must be turned in the nation's record, and a new history must be written on a clean page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>When great men die they and their achievements are consigned to history, beyond the vain applause which vexes the ears of mortal men. For be assured, long before the final tribunal at which all actions are uncovered in the presence of an unerring <rs type="role2">Judge</rs>, there is a human court, the solemn Tribunal of History, whose verdict, purged of prejudice and passion, will render at least a proximate vindication of justice and of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>The time for vapid oratory has ceased, when the pallid shades appear before the <name>Rhadamanthus</name> and the <name>Minos</name>, who decree to the true Immortals the prize of eternal fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>I trust that I construe your purpose aright, when I decline to re-open the issues of the past, leaving them to the adjudication of that day when the record shall be purged of calumny and error, and every false judgment shall be revised in the final verdict of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>In these obsequies of the past let us learn from the <rs>Supreme Ruler</rs> the lesson which He intends to teach.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>For this purpose I read to you the words of the <rs>Prophet Daniel</rs>, after the interpretation of Nebuchadnezzar's dream had been disclosed in a vision by night: <q direct="unspecified">Blessed be the name of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forever and ever; for wisdom and might are His; and He changeth the times and the seasons; He removeth kings and setteth up kings; He giveth wisdom unto the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding; He revealeth the deep and secret things; He knoweth what is in the darkness, and the light dwelleth with Him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>The leading thought here is the divine supremacy over the affairs of men; the same truth announced afterward to Nebuchadnezzar by <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n0276.0009.00212.02406" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,Junius,,,:8"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName>, in declaring the downfall of his greatness: <q direct="unspecified">This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones, to the intent that the living may know that the <rs>Most High</rs> ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth to whomsoever He will, and setteth up over it the basest of men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/><persName><foreName>Daniel</foreName> <genName n="4">IV</genName></persName>., <num value="17">17</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2777"/>But a deeper truth lies covered here than simple superintendence of human fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2778"/>It is the divine purpose running throughout history, the secret thread around which all events crystalize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2779"/>The Supreme Ruler renders His own thought in the free actions of intelligent and responsible agents; who, in accomplishing their designs, at the same time execute His infinite and eternal purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2780"/>Thus, He who is the author of history, must also be its interpreter&mdash;disclosing a continuous <pb id="p.213" n="213"/> plan in the rise and fall of empires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2781"/>Hence the <name>Prophet</name> ascribes to Him the <q direct="unspecified">wisdom and might</q> which are necessary to this sovereign administration; and in <q direct="unspecified">removing and setting up kings.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2782"/>He alone <q direct="unspecified">reveals what is in the darkness</q> by means of <q direct="unspecified">the light that dwelleth with Him.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2783"/></p> 
<p>Our relations to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> are not alone those of the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2784"/>Observe that we are born in the bosom of relationships, so that no <num value="1">one</num> liveth or dieth to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2785"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> breath we depend upon others for the preservation of that life which from others was derived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2786"/>Until in adult years we assume our own position in the world, we are under the law of the household and yield subjection to the authority of the parent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2787"/>In this primary commonwealth man finds himself face to face with <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, not in the isolation of his individual being, but in the association with others where joint duties are imposed and correlative obligations are assumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2788"/>Indeed, in all the stages of life we drift upon the current of our social instincts into associations of various kinds, and the guilds thus constituted, as they turn upon a common interest, are all animated by a common spirit; which gives to each a communal character and form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2789"/>Countless as may be the units of the human race, they co-exist as the factors of a constituted whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2790"/>The threads may be single, but they are woven into a texture which combines them all. How minute soever each may be when separated and alone, it is indispensable to the integrity of the fabric, whose beauty and strength would alike be impaired by the slightest flaw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2791"/>The <rs>Providence</rs>, therefore, over the individual necessarily aligns him with the society to which he belongs; and thus the <name>Divine</name> rule is extended over the whole breadth of history through all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2792"/>Thus we find men distributed into races and nations, each enclosed within corporate limits, under such environment and acted upon by such influences as to evolve a composite character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2793"/>It is thus we speak of race and national characteristics that differentiate entire communities as clearly as the personal traits which distinguish the individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2794"/>It is a most interesting study to investigate the elements of which this aggregate character is composed, and to enumerate the subtle influences by which it has been fashioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2795"/>But whether the analysis be successful or not, we are obliged to accept the obtrusive fact that there is, for example, such a thing as national integrity and honor, quite as sensitive as that of the individual&mdash; <pb id="p.214" n="214"/> and for the assertion and protection of which, as all history attests, the most desolating wars have been waged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2796"/>No less true is it, that organized societies are invested with trusts, greater or less, for which they are held responsible before <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2797"/>Just as individuals are thrown into different providential positions, are endowed with different capacities, and are called to the exercise of different functions, so it is with kingdoms and nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2798"/>Why, there is <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>, with her <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of people&mdash;nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the population of the globe&mdash;yet without adding a fraction to the <rs n="General History" type="misc">general history</rs> of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2799"/>There is <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, stretching its length between the <name>Tropics</name> and beyond them, occupied for <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years by naked savages engaged in internecine and tribal wars; yet, so far as the broad record of mankind is concerned, the <rs>Dark Continent</rs> might just as well have been sunk in the depths of the <num value="2">two</num> oceans which wash its borders&mdash;utterly dead, without a history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2800"/>Going back to what is termed the history of the past, look at the monotonous continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 95" reg="asia">Asia</placeName>, with its ancient colossal empires, following each other in almost funeral procession, without diplomatic intercourse, each swallowing its predecessor, and without breaking the dead level of Asiatic civilization, until it was impinged by the progressive people of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2801"/>Here again is this Western Hemisphere on which we dwell, and where from the beginning the <rs>Red</rs> man has roamed through primeval forests; so far as history is involved, it might as well have emerged only <measure n="300years" type="date">three hundred years</measure> ago from the waters of the sea to become the home of a ripe civilization and of its immortal records.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2802"/>Now, in contrast with all of this, look at little <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 23" reg="asia">Palestine</placeName>, of no larger extent than <num value="1">one</num> of the smallest States of this Union, yet the historic pivot upon which the Old World empires were balanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2803"/>What an illustration of the sovereignty which allots to nations the trusts which they are to fulfil&mdash;that around this little Hebrew State <persName n="Tyre,,,,," id="n0276.0009.00214.02407" reg="mostcommon:Tyre,nomatch:0"><surname>Tyre</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Sidon, Leflore, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057493">Sidon</placeName>, <placeName reg="Misr" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName reg="Suriyah" key="tgn,1000140">Syria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Babylon, White Pine, Nevada" key="tgn,2141869">Babylon</placeName> and <placeName reg="Iran" key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, should revolve as satellites, finding their significance in its history, as the moons of <persName n="Jupiter,,,,," id="n0276.0009.00214.02408" reg="mostcommon:Jupiter,nomatch:0"><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName> find their office in attending the orb around which they sweep!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2804"/>Who can interpret these anomalies in the divine administration?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2805"/>Only He who knows His own purpose in the creation and distribution of races and nations, can explain why the few and the weak should be chosen for the highest achievments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2806"/>In what we fondly style the philosophy of history, the attempt is made to fix the <pb id="p.215" n="215"/> value of each element in the life of a people, reducing the actions of men to mere forms of logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2807"/>But even where the interpretation is just, it is partial at best; and the world's history is read in sections and patches at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2808"/>But if the entire record could be placed before us in a single view, disclosing a unity of design in all its parts, how grand the lesson to those who decipher the <num value="1">one</num> thought of the <name>Deity</name> pervading and illuminating the whole!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2809"/>I have but half expressed the majesty of the conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2810"/>This earth of ours is but a speck or mote in the vastness of the universe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2811"/>Look above you upon the face of the sky, and see uncounted worlds in the immensity of space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2812"/>Not single worlds only, but worlds collected into systems, grouped into families, bound to each other by domestic ties, swinging together in wider orbits around a centre common to them all&mdash;for aught we know, the <rs>Sapphire Throne</rs>, from which the power of a supreme will issues to uphold and control them all. Has each of these a history of its own?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2813"/>And do their several records blend in a history that is truly universal?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2814"/>The creative thought is greater than all combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2815"/>What if this thought should throb as the mighty pulse of universal life and action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2816"/>What if in the august future the vast canvas should be unrolled, disclosing in a single panorama the history of all worlds, in the connection of all the parts with the ineffable glory of Him who thus reveals Himself in the stretch of His wisdom and in the grandeur of His power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2817"/>Truly <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>Lord</rs> reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2818"/></p> 
<p>I have not uttered these sentences merely to dazzle you with the splendor of this generalization; it is full of comfort as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2819"/>A single life may be insignificant in its isolation, whilst in its relation to society it may be of inestimable value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2820"/>Here, for illustration, is a piece of tapestry into which has been woven the history of a kingdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2821"/>The separate gossamer thread may be tinged with a color inappreciably faint, yet without its presence there would be no shading of the picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2822"/>Precisely so the most obscure life may be indispensable to the design which is in the mind of the <rs>Infinite Artist</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2823"/>Our distinctions between great and small disappear from history when projected on the scale of the divine purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2824"/>In like manner disasters and defeats occur in the career of every people; yet they no more disturb the march of universal history than do the regressions of the planets the harmony of the stellar world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2825"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> is in <pb id="p.216" n="216"/> providence, whether its control be over the world of matter or of mind; and the pious heart bows in reverence to the <rs>Supreme Will</rs>, assured that failure can be written upon nothing within the scope of its comprehensive design.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2826"/>These reflections may be brought closer to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2827"/>Reference has already been made to the severe civil conflict through which this country has recently passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2828"/>A civil war, as waged between citizens of the same Commonwealth or State, is necessarily a contention for principles which are drawn into dispute to be more fully defined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2829"/>These lie, more or less, at the foundation of all governments, sometimes rather by implication than in formal statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2830"/>Even when embodied in constitutional provisions there may arise differences of interpretation; or the full sweep of a recognized principle may not be understood except through its outworking in the experience of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2831"/>In the conflict which ensues <num value="1">one</num> of the parties may be overthrown; yet in so far as they stood for what is true, their defeat is not the death of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2832"/>Truth is immortal, and can never die. It is the thought of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> translated into the dialect of man. Often in the history of our race truth has been buried in a protest until the world is ready for its assured resurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2833"/>Hence it comes to pass, at the close of a protracted struggle, there is neither undue exaltation with the victor, nor undue depression with the vanquished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2834"/>The dignity of the conflict, and the conviction that living principles cannot be displaced by physical force, preserves the <num value="1">one</num> party from unseemly vanity or contemptuous scorn; and protect the other, even in the bitterness of defeat, from any sense of humiliation or shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2835"/>He greets the generation after him, assured that no child can arise to be ashamed of his father or of the deeds he has wrought.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2836"/>Another consequence ensues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3494"/>Troops were rushed from point to point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3495"/>Column after column was hurried into combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3496"/>The thrilling shouts of contending hosts could be heard amid the battle's roar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3497"/>Couriers bearing orders dashed on panting steeds through the jungles and into the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3498"/>Battle flags and flying banners mingled in the dreadful strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3499"/>The lurid smoke of battle rose and spread in purple waves as volley after volley thundered its deadly contents amid surging columns and resounding arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3500"/>All day the battle raged, and the issue seemed doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3501"/>But late in the afternoon both wings of the <rs>Federal</rs> line began to recede, and later were driven to confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3502"/>But the left <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> center of the enemy still stood firm and fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3504"/>Charge after charge had been made and repulsed, and it seemed that the position was not to be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3509"/>Pursuit was brief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3513"/>And what did that mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3514"/>Listen! listen! it is the shout of victory!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3515"/>Nearer and nearer it came, louder and louder it grew, grander and grander it rose, as it was taken up by each successive command in the line, till it passed and repassed the entire line of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3517"/>Shout after shout rent the skies, echo after echo died upon the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3519"/>In the exultation of that moment, every man felt that he was compensated for all the effort, all the anguish, and all the danger that the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> fight had cost him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3530"/>His advice in this regard was met with a prompt and almost unanimous rejection by that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3532"/>There were then no other available resources by which the ranks of our armies could be recruited and maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3538"/>Touching his action in this, his last charge, his last battle, I speak as a messenger from the field where he fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3539"/>This battle-ground lies in a beautiful valley and immediately south of the town of <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3540"/>About noon of <dateStruct value="1864-11-30"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="30">30</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> under command of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.02995" reg="mostcommon:Hood,J.,B.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, appeared on the heights of an elevated range of hills that overlooked the valley and the village, and distant about <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">one and a half miles</measure> from the main line of the <rs>Federal</rs> works, which were immediately south of the town and inclosing the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3541"/>Some hours after our arrival on these heights, and after examining the enemy's fortified positions, <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.02996" reg="mostcommon:Hood,J.,B.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> determined to assault the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3542"/>Troops were promptly moved from the central and main road, upon which they had arrived, to the right and left under the cover of these hills, until they were opposite the positions they were directed to take in the line of battle, and were then moved over the hills to the front, and to their proper posts, preparatory to the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3543"/>When these dispositions were made the advance was ordered&mdash;not in battle array, however, for we were too far off to begin the charge&mdash;but in a regimental movement we called <q direct="unspecified">double columns at half distance,</q> in order that we might move with more system and facility, and also more easily pass obstacles, such as fences and small groves of trees which here and there interspersed the otherwise open plain upon which the great struggle was soon to take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3544"/>In the battle disposition <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Cleburne,General,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.02997" reg="nearbymention:Cleburne,Patrick,Ronayne,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> was immediately on the right of the main highway or pike leading into <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName> from the south, and <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Cheatham,,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.02998" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> was immediately on the left of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3545"/>And as <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Granberry,General,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.03001" reg="mostcommon:Granberry,John,C.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Granberry</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> constituted the extreme left flank of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Cleburne,General,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.03002" reg="nearbymention:Cleburne,Patrick,Ronayne,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, and my brigade the extreme right flank of <persName n="Cheatham,,,,," id="n0276.0011.00266.03003" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>'s, we were therefore contiguous in the order of battle, and both in the front line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3546"/>As the array of columns which I have mentioned, with a front of <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> or more in length, moved steadily down the heights and into the valley below with flying banners, beating drums and bristling guns, it presented a scene of the most imposing grandeur and magnificence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3547"/>When we had arrived within about <num value="400">four hundred</num> paces of the enemy's advanced line of entrenchments our columns were halted and deployed into <num value="2">two</num> lines of battle preparatory to the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3548"/>This advanced position of the enemy was not a continuous but a detached line, manned by <num value="2">two</num> brigades, and situated about <num value="600">six hundred</num> paces in front of his main line of formidable works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3549"/>This <pb id="p.267" n="267"/> detached line was immediately in front of <persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n0276.0011.00267.03004" reg="nearbymention:Cleburne,Patrick,Ronayne,,"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>'s left and <persName n="Cheatham,,,,," id="n0276.0011.00267.03005" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>'s right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>When all was ready the <q direct="unspecified">charge</q> was ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>With a wild shout we dashed forward upon this line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>The enemy delivered <num value="1">one</num> volley at our rushing ranks and precipitately fled for refuge to his main and rear line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>At this juncture the shout was raised, <q direct="unspecified">Go into the works with them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>This cry was taken up and vociferated from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> throats as we rushed on after the flying forces we had routed&mdash;killing some in our running fire and capturing others who were slow of foot&mdash;sustaining but small losses ourselves, until we arrived within about <num value="100">one hundred</num> paces of their main line and stronghold, when it seemed to me that hell itself had exploded in our faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>The enemy had thus long reserved their fire for the safety of their routed comrades who were flying to them for protection, and who were just in front of and mingled with the pursuing Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>When it became no longer safe for themselves to reserve their fire, they opened upon us (regardless of their own men who were mingled with us) such a hailstorm of shot and shell, musketry and canister that the very atmosphere was hideous with the shrieks of the messengers of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>The booming of cannon, the bursting of bombs, the rattle of musketry, the shrieking of shells, the whizzing of bullets, the shouting of hosts and the falling of men in their struggle for victory, all made a scene of surpassing terror and awful grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>On he dashed, but for an instant longer, when rider and horse both fell, pierced with many bullets, within a few paces of the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>On we rushed&mdash;his men of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Granberry,,,,," id="n0276.0011.00267.03007" reg="mostcommon:Granberry,John,C.,,:1"><surname>Granberry</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> and mine having mingled as we closed on the line, until we reached the enemy's works; but being now so exhausted and so few in numbers, we halted in the ditch on the outside of the breastworks, among dead and dying men&mdash;both Federals and Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>A few charged over, but were clubbed down with muskets <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> or pierced with bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>For some time we fought them across the breastworks, both sides lying low and putting their guns under the head-logs upon the works, firing rapidly and at random, and not exposing any part of the body except the hand that fired the gun. While this melee was going on across the works we were exposed to a dangerous fire from some of our own men of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Stewart,General,,,," id="n0276.0011.00268.03008" reg="mostcommon:Stewart,William,H.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> to our right rear, there being an angle in the enemy's line in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>At the same time we were subjected to an enfilading fire from the enemy to our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>Finally, the fatality to us from these <num value="3">three</num> fires&mdash;front, rear and left&mdash;became so great that we shouted to the enemy across the works to <q direct="unspecified">cease firing</q> and we would surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>At length they heard us, understood us, and ceased their fire; we crossed the works and surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>It was fatal to leave the ditch and endeavor to escape to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>Every man who attempted it (and a number did) was at once exposed and was shot down without exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>Pardon me if I further digress sufficiently to say that the left of my brigade, under command of <persName n="Rice,Colonel,Horace,,," id="n0276.0011.00268.03009" reg="default:Rice,Horace,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Rice</surname></persName> (I was on the right), successfully broke the line and some of my brave and noble men were <measure n="50" type="killed">killed fifty</measure> paces or more within the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>But just at this critical juncture a reinforcement of a Federal brigade confronted them with a heavy fire, and being few in numbers they were driven back to the opposite side of the works, behind which they took position and bravely held the line they had previously taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3695"/>Southern women have been heretofore referred only to the standards of fiction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3696"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> pieces of fiction that have had a long and popular run in what may be described in a large way as the <rs>North American</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3697"/><num value="1">One</num> is that the stage representation of negro character are true to life; another is that the poor white trash of the <rs>South</rs> are utterly worthless and thriftless; and the other is that the white women of the <rs>South</rs> lived in a state of idleness during the days of slavery, swinging and languishing in hammocks, while bevies of pickaninnies cooled the tropical air with long-handled fans made of peacock tails.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3698"/>Preposterous as they are, age has made these fictions respectable, especially in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3699"/>They strut about in good company, and sometimes a sober historian goes so far as to employ them for the purpose of bolstering up his sectional theories, or, what is still worse, his prejudices.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3700"/>I do not know that these fictions are important, or that they are even interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3701"/>If there was an explosion every time truth was outrun by his notorious competitor, the man who sleeps late of a morning would wake with a snort and imagine that the universe was the victim of a fierce and prolonged bombardment. </p>

<head>Wives of planters.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3702"/>The busiest women the world has ever seen were the wives and daughters of the <rs>Southern</rs> planters during the days of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3703"/>They were busy from morning until night, and sometimes far into the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3704"/>They were practically at the head of the commissary and sanitary departments of the plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3705"/>It was a part of their duty to see that the negroes were properly fed, clothed, and shod.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3706"/>They did not, it is true, go into the market and purchase the supplies; that was a matter that could be attended to even by a dull-witted man; but after the supplies were bought it was the woman's intelligent management that caused them to be properly distributed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3707"/>I have never yet heard of a Southern woman who surrendered the keys of her smoke-house and store-room to an overseer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3708"/>The distribution of the supplies, however, was a comparatively small item.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3709"/>Take, for example, the clothing provided for, say <num value="100">one hundred</num> negroes, male and female, large and small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3710"/>The cloth was bought in bolts, though occasionally a considerable portion was woven on the plantation on the old-fashioned hand-looms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3711"/>Whether bought or woven the cloth had to be cut out and made into garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3712"/>Who was to superintend and see to all this if not the woman?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3713"/>Who was at the head of the domestic establishment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3714"/>There were seamstresses to make up the clothes, but all the details and preparations had to be looked after by the mistress, and it oftentimes fell to her lot to go down on her knees on the floor and cut out garments for hours at a time.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.13.177" type="section" n="c.13.177"> 
<head>Sanitary Experts.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3715"/>And then there was the health of the negroes&mdash;a very important item where a <num value="20">twenty</num>-year-old field hand was worth <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3716"/>Who was to look after the sick when, as frequently happened, the physician was miles away?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3717"/>Who indeed, it not the mistress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3718"/>It was natural, therefore&mdash;and not only natural, but absolutely necessary&mdash;that a part of the storeroom should be an apothecary's shop on a small scale, and that the <rs>Southern</rs> woman should know what to prescribe in all the simpler forms of disease.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3719"/>It is to be borne in mind that when the negroes came in from their work the plantation became a domestic establishment, and its demands were such that it was necessary for a woman to be at the head of it. On the energy, the industry and the apt management of the mistress the success of the plantation depended to a great extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3720"/>It was not <pb id="p.279" n="279"/> often these qualities were lacking, either, for they were absolutely essential to the success, the comfort and the moral discipline of the establishment.</p></div2>

<head><rs type="role" reg="Queen">Queens</rs> of the kitchen.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3721"/>Then there was the kitchen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3722"/>No Southern woman could afford to turn that important department over to a negro cook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3723"/>Such a thing was not to be thought of. The mistress of the plantation was also the mistress of the kitchen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3724"/>In order to teach their negroes the art of cooking the <rs>Southern</rs> women had to know how to cook themselves, and they were compelled to gain their knowledge from practical experience, for the kitchen is <num value="1">one</num> of the places where theories cannot be entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3725"/>There are negro women still living who got their training in the plantation kitchen, under the eyes of their mistresses, and their cooking is a spur to the appetite and a remedy for indigestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3726"/>It is no wonder that a Georgia woman, when she heard the negroes were really free, gave a sigh of relief and exclaimed:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3727"/><q direct="unspecified">Thank heaven!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3728"/>I shall have to work for them no more!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3729"/></p> 
<p>These Southern women were the outgrowth of the plantation system, the result of <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> generations of development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3730"/>On that system they placed the impress of their humanity and refinement; and the outcome of it is to be seen in the condition of the negro race to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3731"/>In the sphere of their homes and in their social relations they exercised a power and influence that has no parallel in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3732"/>As they were themselves, so they trained their daughters to be, and the <rs>Southern</rs> women of to-day still possess the characteristics that made their mothers and their grandmothers beautiful and gracious still possess the refinement that built up a rare civilization amid unpromising surroundings; still possess the energy and patience and gentleness that wrought order and discipline on the plantations.</p></div2>

<head>In this generation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3733"/>As the vine was, so must the fruit be. I have tried to describe the mistress of the plantation for the reason that her characteristics and tendencies have been transmitted to the <rs>Southern</rs> women of this generation and to the young girls who are growing into womanhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3734"/>It is inevitable, however, that certain of these characteristics should be modified or amplified according as the circumstances of an environment altogether new may demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3735"/><pb id="p.280" n="280"/></p> 
<p>I know of no more beautiful or romantic civilization than that which blossomed under the plantation system, and yet, in the natural order of things, it would have inevitably have run to caste distinctions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3736"/>It had social ideals that were impracticable, and it had literary ideals that were foolish; nevertheless, after everything had been said, caste distinctions under the plantation system would have been less distasteful than those which are now in process of organization in some parts of this country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3737"/>Whatever the development of Southern civilization might have been under the old system it has come under the domination of the new. That the new has been strengthened and sweetened thereby I think will not be denied by impartial observers who have no pet theories to nurse.</p></div2>

<head>An inheritance of graciousness.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3738"/>Take, for example, the home life of the plantation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3739"/>It was larger, ampler and more perfect than that which exists in the <rs>Republic</rs> to-day, not because it was more leisurely and freer from care, but because the aims and purposes of the various members of the family were more concentrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3740"/>The hospitality that was a feature of it was more unrestrained and simpler, because it bore no relation whatever to the demands and suggestions of what is now known in <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> newspapers as <q direct="unspecified">Society.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3741"/></p> 
<p>The home life of the old plantation has had a marked influence on the <rs>Southern</rs> women of to-day in their struggles with adverse circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3742"/>They lack, for <num value="1">one</num> thing, the assurance of those who have inherited the knack of making their way among strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3743"/>The poetic young Bostonian who has been writing recently of <q direct="unspecified">The Mannerless Sex</q> and <q direct="unspecified">The Ruthless Sex</q> could never have made the <rs>Southern</rs> woman a text for his articles, and I trust that for generations yet to come they will retain the gentleness and the graciousness that belong to them by right of inheritance.</p></div2>

<head>A Benificient influence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3744"/>Comparatively speaking, it has only been a few years that the <rs>Southern</rs> woman has been compelled by circumstances to seek a wider and more profitable field for her talent, her energy and her industry than the home and the fireside afford, and the experience of these few years has demonstrated the fact that she is amply able to take care of herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3745"/><pb id="p.281" n="281"/></p> 
<p>In shaping and developing what is called the new literary movement in the <rs>South</rs>, she has shown herself to be a far more versatile worker than the men&mdash;more artistic and more conscientious.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3746"/>She has made herself felt in art, in science and in the schools; she has taken a place in the ranks of the journalists; she has a place on the stage and the platform; she is to be found in many of the trades that are next door to the arts, in the professions and in business; she is stenographying, typewriting, clerking, dairying, gardening; she is to be found, in short, wherever there is room for her, and her field is always widening.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3747"/>I think she will exercise a mellowing and restraining influence on the ripping and snorting age just ahead of us&mdash;the rattling and groaning age of electricity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3748"/>What part she may play in the woman's rights movement of the future it is difficult to say. Just now she has no aptitude in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3749"/>She has been taught to believe that the influences that are the result of a happy home-life are more powerful and more important elements of politics than the casting of a ballot; and in this belief she seems to be at <num value="1">one</num> with an overwhelming majority of American women&mdash;the mothers and daughters who are the hope and pride of the <rs>Republic</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3750"/>Yet she is an earnest and untiring temperance worker.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3751"/>Conservative in all other directions, she is inclined to be somewhat radical in her crusade against rum. She is inclined to fret and grieve a little over the fact that public opinion failed to keep pace with her desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3752"/>The wheels of legislation do not move fast enough for her, and she is inclined to wonder at it. In the innocence of her heart she has never suspected that there is a demijohn in the <orgName n="Legislative Committee" type="committee">legislative committee</orgName>-room.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3753"/>There is no question and no movement of real importance in which she is not interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3754"/>Her devotion and self-sacrifice in the past have consecrated her to the future, and her sufferings and privations have taught her the blessings of charity in its largest and last interpretation.</p></div2></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3983"/>This tasteful monument, due to woman's zeal, is a lasting but tardy testimony of a feeling which has lived and grown in the hearts of the people since they, whose virtues it commemorates, laid down their lives for the honor of the <rs>State</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3984"/>A generation has well nigh come and gone since this open tribute was due, and its payment now is proof that we act upon no transient impulse, but a strong and staple sentiment, which has endured and will endure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3985"/>This day is distant from the stormy period to which these rites relate; the martial ardor, which the notes of war aroused, has long ago abated, and the seal of Southern honor has been set upon the pledge of peace; yet, after all these years we are here to declare before the world that this monument betokens our cordial recognition and deliberate sanction of the intent and of the action of those whom it commemorates, and that it is our public attestation that their intent was pure and their action honorable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>Neither time nor change nor circumstance can alter this our mature conviction, and to openly affirm it here, this vast concourse of the people have assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3987"/>It is for this that men and women, old and young, of every shade of taste and opinion and from every vocation in life, have come together to day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3988"/>It is not ambition, nor the hope of gain, nor self-interest in any form, that brings together these earnest men and women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>They are not here to ask anything from their Government, nor to present any grievance, nor to petition for any redress, nor to protest against any wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3998"/>His political philosophy had the endorsement of a long list of distinguished names, but, as to its leading features, there was none more emphatic or more potential than that of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0276.0018.00299.03405" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, despite some divergence in their views touching the limits of a <name>State</name>'s power while remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>By his powerful reasoning <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0276.0018.00299.03406" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> sought to enforce certain sound and salutary lessons of constitutional interpretation, which, had they been accepted in both sections of the <rs>Union</rs> as they were in <num value="1">one</num>, our country would have been spared <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of waste and suffering and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>But they were rejected, and out of the construction, and, as we thought, the perversion of our written Constitution, arose the gigantic conflicts of arms which followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4001"/>In that conflict, <pb id="p.300" n="300"/> sustained, as we believed, by the fundamental principle of popular liberty, we staked our all upon the supreme sovereignty of a State, and the inalienable rights of the people of the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4002"/>Our construction of the <rs>Constitution</rs> lost much favor, to which it was entitled, because <q direct="unspecified">slavery was sheltered under the sovereignty of the <rs>State</rs>,</q> and in our contention we encountered all the prejudice against slavery, which was so intense that many, who agreed with us on the questions involved, when abstractly considered, readily adopted any construction which looked to the overthrow of that institution.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4003"/>But we did not go to war for slavery, though slavery was interwoven with the causes and intensified the bitterness of the war, and the fate of slavery was forever settled by the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4004"/>We were not precipitated into it by reckless public men, who had not counted the cost; for the great leaders, and notably <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0276.0018.00300.03407" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, were slower in the movement than the masses of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4005"/>We did not take up arms because we were dissatisfied with our form of government, for we valued that then as we value it now; and we so loved the <rs>Constitution</rs> for the safeguards of liberty which we read in it that we fashioned our Confederate Constitution after it as a model.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4006"/>We loved the flag, too, with its stars telling of co-equal States in a common Union, so long as it floated above us with that symbolism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4007"/>Happily it now floats over us again as the full equals of all who live under its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/>The war, with us, did not originate in ambition, nor did we fight for spoils, for conquest or for fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4009"/>With us it was no war of invasion or of retaliation or of revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4010"/>It was not to build up some great leader's fortunes nor to elevate some popular favorite to place or power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4011"/>We went to war for none of these; but it was to <q direct="unspecified">save the <rs>Constitution</rs>,</q> as we read it, and to save ourselves, and to preserve our cherished form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4012"/>We resisted those perversions which we believed would destroy that Constitution and us, and subvert that form of government.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4013"/>Those whose interests were not ours, as ours were not theirs, sought, as we believed, by a <q direct="unspecified">system of constructions</q> to gain what was not given in the compact under which all were living, and to ignore and obliterate the true intent and meaning and purpose of that compact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4014"/>This perversion of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as it seemed to us, was wilful and systematic, and daily it grew more dangerous and unendurable, and we felt we could not, without dishonor and disaster, submit to what seemed inevitably coming and actually impending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4015"/>Our rights and liberties seemed in the utmost peril, and the danger was increased <pb id="p.301" n="301"/> by delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4016"/>After all efforts for peaceful solution had proved of no avail, and our great leaders' plea, <q direct="unspecified">We ask only for the <rs>Constitution</rs>,</q> had brought forth no response, and only when there was <q direct="unspecified">no longer any room for hope,</q> did we <q direct="unspecified">appeal to arms and to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of battles.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4017"/>Then, throughout the <rs>South</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">We must fight</q> was sounded from the mountains to the sea&mdash;and we did fight; and to such a fight as our dead heroes and their comrades made there is no parallel in history, and never can be until some other people equal to ours in courage and endurance, with the same stimulus and the same spirit of devotion, shall shut their eyes to untold odds against them and close their ears to every warning of calculation or policy, and wage a great war upon a cherished sentiment and sincere conviction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4018"/>It was the effort to establish the true boundary line between the constitutional authority of a State and the general government that brought the war upon us. It was to maintain the theory of government which <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n0276.0018.00301.03408" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> and those of his school taught us that <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> Southern soldiers went eagerly to the field, and they to whom we raise this monument freely gave up their lives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4019"/>It was not for power, nor for riches, nor for ambition's sake, but for a great governmental principle of right which was rooted and grounded in their faith and sanctioned by their judgments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4020"/>Without altering or wavering our martyred dead stood by this principle with their lives, and while the great guns of war shook to its center this now peaceful and prosperous land; while men were slain by tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> and hearts were stricken and homes were darkened; while the groans of the dying and the wails of those bereft burdened the very air from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, inspired by their example those who survived stood to the very last by the teachings of <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0276.0018.00301.03409" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> and <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n0276.0018.00301.03410" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>, and those who held the same political faith.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4021"/>When the end came, and with disappointment and defeat, it seemed only natural that the losses and afflictions of those whose banners had gone down should engender bitterness toward those whose teaching and guidance had contributed to produce the disastrous conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4022"/>Here was a trying test of fidelity, sincerity and truth, and here the grandest characteristic of our noble Southern people finds beautiful and honorable illustration.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4023"/>No citizen nor soldier, no man nor woman, of all the bereaved and disappointed sons and daughters of the <rs>South</rs>, ever cursed the memory or even impugned the statesmanship of <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n0276.0018.00301.03411" reg="nearbymention:Calhoun,John,C.,,"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, for whose political doctrines they had risked all and lost all; and for our grand <pb id="p.302" n="302"/> old chief, who came home to spend his declining years within the limits of our State and his, there never was a breath of criticism or repining from his scourged and afflicted people&mdash;nothing but faith and trust, affection, admiration, sympathy, and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4024"/>It was most fitting and becoming that the evening of his life should be passed on the soil of the state to whose name he had brought so much of honor and distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4025"/>In the dignified retirement of his unpretending home, on the southern border of that separate southern nationality for which, in vain, his best efforts and powers had been given, this disfranchised citizen of a government whose flag he had defended with his blood had a firmer hold upon the hearts of his people than any ruler reigning in the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4026"/>There is nothing in history like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4027"/>Look over the course of nations from the dawn of time, turn through the books of the world's history whenever written, search all the annals of the earth, and you will find no other single instance where a vanquished people have so idolized the leader of a cause that had failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4028"/>Pardon me if I linger upon this thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4029"/>It fills me with admiration and with gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4030"/>I am proud and I am thankful that I am of a people who have this matchless record of devotion to lay before the world&mdash;proud of whatever of their strength I gain from their example, and if, as has been said, their deep sentimental nature is their weakness, I am thankful that I share that weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4031"/>I glory in that quality, whatever it is, which makes them true to their own history, for it is the same that sustained them in war and gave them strength to bear the greater strain to which they were afterward subjected, and makes them the true and loyal citizens they are to-day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4032"/>But what less was to be expected of these people, with their history and traditions and the examples they have had to give them strength and inspiration?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4033"/>Back to the time when this government was organized, and before, we can turn with pride and point to what Southern men have done to elevate mankind and stimulate and cultivate the aspirations of the masses of the people and to make this country what it is. From among them came the statesman who wrote the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, and, strange as it may sound in this day of universal freedom, it is said that all who signed that declaration, except those from the <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">State of Massachusetts</placeName>, and perhaps <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others, were slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4034"/>From among them came the <rs>Father</rs> of His Country, the father of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the greatest of all its expounders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4035"/>At the head of great armies, in the presidential office, in cabinet and court, and in all the nation's <pb id="p.303" n="303"/> high councils, everywhere, in peace and in war, great Southern lights illuminate the annals of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> and shed upon our country's name its chief honor and renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4036"/>From the foundation of the government, through all the epochs of peace and arms, down to <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, Southern statesmen and orators, Southern philosophers and judges, Southern patriots and soldiers, have enacted the brightest chapters of this country's history, and to them we are indebted for the fundamental sources of its present power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4037"/>When the disunion movement grew out of the construction of our written Constitution, which was adopted <q direct="unspecified">to form a more perfect union,</q> and the <rs>Southern</rs> people sought to withdraw from the government to which they had contributed so much, the great war came and with it came the matchless Southern soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4038"/>Manhood, and pride, and honor, were his rightful inheritance, coming down to him through a long line of Southern patriots, who were the moulders of Southern sentiment and opinion, and through fire and blood he proved himself a true exemplar of these virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4039"/>His figure will stand out in history as the most resplendent illustration the world has ever known of duty eagerly performed, of unrequited sacrifice without complaint, and of spirit proof against despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4040"/>There is not time, which I regret, to mention names, nor rank, nor conspicuous service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4041"/>The roll of honor is too long for this-too full of deeds of heroism and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4042"/>I must be content to deal with the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier as a type and the <rs>Confederate</rs> dead as a class, and yet I feel that none here will consider me invidious if I stay to call a single name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4043"/>I would speak of him who, when he saw the end of the struggle was near, said to a distinguished general from his own State: <q direct="unspecified">Sir, the men of this war who will deserve the most honor and gratitude are not the men of rank, but the men of the ranks&mdash;the privates.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4044"/>This just tribute to the nameless heroes who won fame and titles for other men came from <num value="1">one</num>, himself of highest rank, of whom years ago, in time of profound peace, the head of the <rs>American</rs> army declared he was the greatest soldier then living in the world, and, if there should be opportunity, he would <q direct="unspecified">prove himself the greatest captain in history.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4045"/>The occasion came, and <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n0276.0018.00303.03412" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> made good the prediction of his old commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4046"/>When history comes to exercise its proper province of impartiality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4047"/>and the world shall view his achievements in connection with the meagre means at his command and the adverse conditions by which he was beset, the world's verdict, as I believe it, will be: Greater than <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0276.0018.00303.03413" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> or <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0276.0018.00303.03414" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>; greater even than <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> had <pb id="p.304" n="304"/> the opportunity to prove himself in war. Verily the greatest captain in history was the chief of the tattered Southern forces; great as the victor of a <num value="100">hundred</num> fields won by his skill and valor, but grand in the calm dignity of his quiet life of usefulness and honor, after all hope of separate Southern independence had been blotted out in darkness forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4048"/>From the day when he put away the crown and refused the chief command of all the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4049"/>He said that <q direct="unspecified">human virtue should be equal to human adversity,</q> and his life, and the life of <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0276.0018.00304.03416" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and the lives of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of their humble followers, have proven that it was so in these illustrious Southern leaders and those inspired by their example.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4050"/>They, whose conduct illustrated this, were the representatives and the jewels of the old <rs>South</rs>&mdash;&mdash;the fair and fruitful land, where manhood and high endeavor, lofty sentiment, and open hospitality, found their favorite habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4051"/>That old South has its waste places and its ruins to mark the track of war; it has its broken shafts and fallen temples, but it has its traditions and its memories to inspire and strengthen the hopes and hearts and hands of its men and women, and it has its history, which is the honor and glory of its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4052"/>In this day when not business alone, but public virtue and private honor, official fidelity, and even the observances of religion are looked upon and estimated too much, I fear, from the standpoint of hard practicality and <q direct="unspecified">trade,</q> men come among us and prate of building up what they are pleased to term a <q direct="unspecified">New South</q>&mdash;as if the safest elements and the most valuable constituent forces which can enter into a new order and new customs here must not come from what is left of us the old. They would have us break all our cherished images, bury <q direct="unspecified">a past that is not dead&mdash;that cannot die,</q> and consign all its precious memories and splendid examples to oblivion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4053"/>Undervaluing our people, and allowing nothing for the hard conditions with which they must contend, they point us to our thrifty Northern neighbors as patterns for our imitation, and exhort us to keep abreast of what they style the progressive spirit of the age.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4054"/>These disciples of modern progress mean well in what they say, but the common sense of those they would instruct has long ago suggested and adopted all that is worth knowing or observing in their <pb id="p.305" n="305"/> cold philosophy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4055"/>All of us are eager to know from any who can teach us how, better than we are doing, we can adapt ourselves to our changed condition, and to follow any example, wherever found, which has in it any useful lesson that we ought to learn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4056"/>But all this can be better done if we keep alive and foster, for our guidance and support, those distinctive Southern sentiments and characteristic qualities which have been the strength of our people, and on which not only their prosperity and progress, but, in view of their peculiar surroundings, their safety also must depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>For some fancied advantage of an utilitarian kind let us be slow to give up something worth more to us, even in matters purely practical, than all that is promised in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>Let us not profanely turn our backs upon the old <rs>South</rs> with its traditions and examples and hallowed memories; let us never stifle the sentiment which has animated its sons and daughters and sink it into mere flinty practicality on the false idea that the virtues which make our people what they are are incompatible with true progress and improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>It does not argue that we do not live in the present, and look hopefully to the future, that we cling to the memories of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>We can love the <rs>Union</rs> and still delight to dwell upon the course of those who are faithful to the <rs>Union</rs> now, as they were to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>We do not stand in the way of the earnest work of real progress when we deprecate any tendency to decay in Southern manhood, and foster those sentiments which will guide us and inspire us, hereafter as heretofore, to be true alike to ourselves and the government to which our allegiance is due.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>If any here consider these expressions the offspring of mere Southern ardor and enthusiasm, I would ask them what it was that moved old and young, rich and poor, slaveholders and non-slaveholders, ministers of the church and men of the world, the sedate and thoughtful, the reckless and impulsive, all alike, in <num value="11">eleven</num> States, to rise up as <num value="1">one</num> man and fly to arms with <num value="1">one</num> impulse in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>What was it that sustained them, with a government born almost under fire, without organization or military training, arms, supplies or means, without allies or sympathy, shut in by a close blockade and shut out from all the world, with the organized government and its army and navy and treasury and its own vast resources backed up by foreign commerce and manufactures, all against them, what sustained them in a <num value="4">four</num>-years' contest with the trained troops of the government and the volunteers of all the <name>States</name> of the mighty <rs>North</rs> and the legions of mercenaries drawn from the nations beyond <pb id="p.306" n="306"/> the seas?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/>Do not seek to account for it without resort to something higher than mere physical courage and ordinary endurance; for if you do, the facts and figures of recorded history will overwhelm you. Listen to some of these:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>It has been said that in a republic like ours every citizen is a soldier and every soldier a citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>Living under such a system, it is proper to consider the civic in connection with the military qualities of those who are the <rs>State</rs>'s dependence in peace and war alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/><placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, having sent virtually all her white male adult population to the field, was dependent for her rehabilitation in peace upon the men who had been her soldiers in war, and if we will but glance at the vicissitudes which have marked her history, while the events of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct> have been receding into the past, it will appear that the record of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier's service to the <rs>State</rs>, as a citizen in peace, is a worthy compliment of that he made in war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>In that time the <rs>State</rs> and her people have known many shifting fortunes, some sad and sickening, disgraceful to those who were their authors; some wholesome and hopeful, creditable to those who wrought them out. There was harshness by the victors not wholly unexpected, some leniency which the vanquished appreciated, and much unjust opinion followed by reaction and correction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>There were wrongs which have been righted, trials that have ended, humiliation which honor and courage have survived&mdash;there was darkness followed by the light of day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>In that time our great chief, whose natal day was fitly chosen for these ceremonies, was cast into prison without warrant, to come forth without plea for pardon, undismayed, and vindicate himself and his cause in a great history read by all the nations of the earth, and to live and die dearer to his people than in the day of his greatest power.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>Later we saw the same intruder embrace the privilege of vacating the same office in advance of a judgment of impeachment, and since then we have seen successive incumbents of the people's choice fill that office ably, faithfully, and acceptably.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>We have seen our senators and representatives, duly chosen and accredited, turned away from the <rs>Capitol</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> as unworthy to participate in national legislation; but for years, in either house, <pb id="p.309" n="309"/> there have been none to question their rightful status or challenge their official equality.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4094"/>At a time when the passions of war had not subsided, and there was bitterness in the hearts of those in <num value="1">one</num> section toward their countrymen in the other; at a time when the <rs>South</rs> was no readier than the <rs>North</rs> for the lessons of forgiveness and fraternity which had to be taught and learned before there could be any real peace or progress for us here; at such a time as this we saw a great Mississippian move out in advance of his own people, a pioneer in a dangerous field, and sound the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> note of pacification, which in time brought the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4095"/>We heard him tell our estranged and distrustful brethren that <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>South</rs> prostrate, exhausted, drained of her life blood, but still honorable and true, accepts the bitter award of the bloody arbitrament without reservation,</q> and we saw men turn and listen to his plea for peace, good-will, and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4096"/>We have seen the influence of that plea widen and extend from the day when it was offered, have seen it reinforced by the efforts of patriots <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, until lately we saw a sectionalism openly condemned by the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4097"/>The prime mover in this great work of restoration and conciliation, though always an ardent Southerner, and once a secessionist and a Southern soldier, was called to the cabinet of a Northern president, and sits to-day in honor in that great court where the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> is finally construed, a living witness that the success of Southern statesmanship involves no abandonment of principle or independence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4099"/>The period covers <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of oppression, spoliation, contempt of the laws, humiliation and poverty&mdash;all bravely and <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> patiently endured without the sacrifice of manhood or self-respect&mdash;followed by <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure> of new hopes and reviving business, order gradually restored, the laws observed, blooming fields and the blessings of education liberally dispensed, until now no State in the <rs>Union</rs> outside the <rs>South</rs> shows such signs of relative improvement as ours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4100"/>In all this you see the hand of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier as a citizen in peace, and the resolution, the conservatism and unconquerable spirit of which he is the type.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4101"/>Those who fell upon the battle-field or died from disease or the severities of Northern prisons left an unrivalled record of duty done for State, for honor and for home, but in the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> they were spared the trials and the woes which tell the story of the high achievement of those they left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4102"/>If they could reach us from the grave they would tell us that the survivors lived to encounter much that was worse than an honorable death, and that the crowning glory of this people lies in the stern virtue, the courage to endure, the self-respecting dignity and the inborn pride of character which signalized their conduct after that mockery of peace came which for a time was worse than war. The final test&mdash;the cruel, crucial test&mdash;came not when our brave men had arms in their hands and were using them in their bloody work, and our anxious women were praying for the victory which they never doubted would ultimately come, but in the dismal reconstruction period which began when the conflict of arms had ended, and brought us the rule of bayonet and with it usurpation and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4103"/>Then the iron heel of power was set upon the necks of the defenceless; aliens clothed with authority came among us to rule over us and to plunder us, to degrade the brave men and affront the fair women of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>Ignorance, venality and brutality were installed in the <rs>State</rs>'s high places and trampled on its laws and ,upon every right belonging to its people; and the climax of crime was completed when our new rulers armed the ignorant and deluded negroes with dangerous powers and set them in authority in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4105"/>Through the necessities of the people these rulers tried to tempt them, and by the offers of preferment which they had the power to bestow they sought to bribe their leading men to break their faith with those who had honored them and followed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>At that time there was poverty in every house; men in every walk of life were uncertain of their bread, and gentle women were reduced to drudgery in many a stately home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>The old were bowed down by the agony of disappointment, their hopes gone, <pb id="p.311" n="311"/> their fortunes wrecked and ruined, and the future stretched out hopelessly <q direct="unspecified">like a dark and rainy sea</q> before the young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4108"/>Amid all this sorrow, all this horror, under the yoke, with the blackness of darkness gathering about them, these proud people, inspired and strengthened by the example of their brethren, who had died for duty, sternly withstood all, bravely endured all while they watched at the tomb and waited for the resurrection of their buried hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>They could suffer, but they could not sell themselves&mdash;would not barter their principles for place nor power nor plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>They clung to their honor and their self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>It was their Southern sentiment, ingrained, inherited, and intensified by trial, that saved and redeemed them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4112"/>If you ask me if there is anything in the world's history like this, I tell you there is not. If you ask me if the courage and the constancy of the men and women of other blood or other clime could have passed through this furnace without melting in the fire, I proudly answer no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4113"/>And for the security we now enjoy, for the signs of prosperity and contentment around us, and for the good government we live under in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> to-day, we are indebted to that courage and pride, that instinct of honor in Southern men and women which force cannot conquer nor suffering subdue.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4114"/>Woe to us if we let that spirit die, for we need it here, no less than heretofore we need it now, all else aside, to maintain the status of our race while we keep up our patient struggle with that overshadowing problem which the war left us to solve&mdash;that awful problem which had its origin in the line of race and color drawn by that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who, for his own inscrutable purposes, as a great divine has said, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <q direct="unspecified">shattered the unity of human speech</q> and afterward <q direct="unspecified">dispersed the human family in different grand divisions.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4115"/></p> 
<p>I may not, without exceeding the limits proper to this address, pursue my subject further, and yet, in the performance of my sacred task, I feel that I have rendered but scant justice to the <rs>Southern</rs> soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4116"/>He staked his life upon his own view of duty, and whether he sealed his devotion with his blood and died upon the battle-field, or was the victim of disease or cruelty, or lived to rescue his State from ruin as a citizen in peace, he has illustrated some quality in our people which makes them always, in responding to a principle or a sentiment, equal to any duty, any daring, any suffering, any sacrifice.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4117"/>There is some priceless element in Southern character that I cannot define, which makes our people at once practical and sentimental&mdash;makes them good soldiers and good citizens, sustains them in every <pb id="p.312" n="312"/> trial, adapts them to every changed condition and anchors them upon their honor as a rock; something that makes the men knightly in their deference for women, and makes the gentle woman strong when trouble comes; I know not what it is, but it is the same thing that made them true to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> while it existed and makes them true to the <rs>Union</rs> now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4118"/>There is nothing disloyal in it, for it is the very essence of patriotism; there is nothing non-progressive or impractical in it, for here it must be the handmaid of all true progress and improvement; there is no weakness in it, for in it lie our chief strength and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4119"/>Call it what you will, it is real, it is Southern and it is worth preserving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4762"/>The generations of the disinterested must succeed the generations of the prejudiced before history, properly termed such, can be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4763"/>This, precisely, is the work we now attempt, to construct the archives in which shall be collected these memoirs to serve for future history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4764"/>It is believed that invaluable documents are scattered over the whole land, in loose sheets, perhaps lying in the portfolios of private gentlemen, and only preserved as souvenirs of their own parts in the historic drama.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4765"/>Existing in forms so perishable, regarded, it may be, only as so much waste paper, by those into whose hands they must fall, no delay should be suffered in their collection and preservation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4766"/>There is doubtless, too, much that is yet unwritten floating only in the memories of the living, which if not speedily rescued will be swallowed in the oblivion of the grave, but which, if reduced to record and collated, would afford the key to many a cypher, in a little while to become unintelligible for want of interpretation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4767"/>All this various material, gathered from every section, will need to be industriously classified and arranged, and finally deposited in the central archives of the <name>Society</name>, under the care of appropriate guardians.

<p>To this task of collection we invite the immediate attention and co-operation of our copatriots throughout the <rs>South</rs>, to facilitate which we propose the organization of State and district associations, that our whole people may be brought in harmony of action in this important matter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4769"/>The rapid changes through which the institutions of the country are now passing, and the still more stupendous revolutions in the opinions of men, remind us that we stand to-day upon the outer verge of a great historic cycle, within which a completed past will shortly be enclosed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4770"/>Another cycle may touch its circumference, but the events it shall embrace will be gathered around another historic centre, and the future historian will pronounce that in stepping from the <num value="1">one</num> to the other he has entered upon another and separate volume of the nation's record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4771"/>Let us, who are soon to be in that past to which we properly belong, see that there are no gaps in the record.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4772"/>Thus shall we discharge a duty to the fathers whose principles we inherit; to the children, who will then know whether to honor or to dishonor the sires that begot them; and, above all, to the dead heroes sleeping on the vast battle plains, from the <rs>Susquehannah</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>, whose epitaph history yet waits to engrave upon their tombs.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>When I began duty as chaplain and professor of ethics, etc., at the <orgName n="Military Academy" type="academy">Military Academy</orgName>, <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, in the summer of <dateStruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></dateStruct>, the late <persName n="Polk,Bishop,,,," id="n0276.0026.00371.04112" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> was cadet in his <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/><pb id="p.372" n="372"/></p> 
<p>As my academic instructions were confined to the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> or oldest class, and the association of the cadets with the officers of the academy was very limited, I had no knowledge of him as <num value="1">one</num> of the congregation to which I preached on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, until circumstances of a very interesting character brought him to my house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>The condition of the academy was very far from being encouraging to a chaplain seeking the spiritual welfare of his charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>There was not <num value="1">one</num> professor of religion among the officers, military or civil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>Several of them were friendly to the efforts of the chaplain, others were decidedly the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>Of the cadets, not <num value="1">one</num> was known to make a profession of personal interest in religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>There was a great deal of avowed and manifested infidelity, accompanied with manifestation of a disposition to scoff at the <rs>Christian</rs> faith and life, and this among cadets, officers, and instructors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>My venerable and beloved friend and then commanding officer, <persName n="Thayer,Colonel,Sylvanus,,," id="n0276.0026.00372.04113" reg="default:Thayer,Sylvanus,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Sylvanus</foreName> <surname>Thayer</surname></persName>, whose name I can never utter without a tribute of veneration and love, though not a communicant of any church, must be understood, with other of the officers, as untouched by any such remarks as the above.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>I had been laboring under these circumstances nearly a year without the slightest appearance of any encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>Not a cadet had ever called to see me; I knew them only as I met them in my class, or saw them as a congregation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>They seemed to feel as if it would be regarded as a profession of some serious interest in religion to come to see me. <num value="1">One</num> of them, whose father had requested him by letter that he would become acquainted with me, was afraid (as he afterwards told me) to do so, out of the fear just mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>He put it off until tidings of his father's death constrained him to fill his father's last injunction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>These statements are important in their bearing on the character of our cadet.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/>In the deepest of my discouragement, when I scarcely ventured to hope for any fruit of my ministry, and when I had concluded a series of discourses on the <name>Evidences</name> of Christianity without any known effect, the cadet just alluded to came to my study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>He introduced himself by saying he came to fulfill his father's last request; that his father had recently died; and, he was ashamed to say, a foolish fear had long kept him from coming to see me. Before he left me I put <num value="2">two</num> tracts into his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/><q direct="unspecified">This,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">is for you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>It was addressed to a person in affliction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>The other was addressed to an unbeliever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/><q direct="unspecified">Take this,</q> I said, <q direct="unspecified">and drop it somewhere in the barracks; perhaps I shall hear of it again.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>He smiled, and said he would do as I asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>A week had passed, and I had forgotten the tract, but the following <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> came another cadet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>I <pb id="p.373" n="373"/> met him at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>He was a stranger to me. As I took his hand he said, <q direct="unspecified">My name is <persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00373.04114" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><surname>Polk</surname></persName>,</q> and could say no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>Perceiving that some great trouble was in his mind, I led him to a chair; he was still silent, as if he feared to try to speak lest he should not control his feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>Supposing he had gotten into trouble with the authorities of the institution, I asked him to trust me as a friend, and freely tell me all his burden; then he could contain himself no longer, but with a burst of feeling and intense expression of a mind convinced of sin, and literally and earnestly begging to be told what he must do for salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>I will not take space to relate the particulars of that part of the conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>I was amazed at the depth and power of his convictions and anxieties, and his readiness for whatever might be required of him as a servant of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00373.04115" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>The hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was manifestly there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>He had conversed with nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>There was no <num value="1">one</num> there but his minister who could have comprehended his state of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>I asked him how it came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/><q direct="unspecified">I picked up a tract in my room; who put it there I do not know.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>I asked, <q direct="unspecified">What tract?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>He gave the title; it was the tract sent at a venture the previous <rs>Saturday</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>Then he said the discourses on the <name>Evidences</name> of Christianity had made a certain measure of impression on his mind, which had been in a degree skeptical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>That having heard I had caused a number of copies of <persName n="Gregory,Doctor,Olenthus,,," id="n0276.0026.00373.04116" reg="default:Gregory,Olenthus,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Olenthus</foreName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>'s letters on the <name>Evidences</name>, Doctrines and Duties to be brought to <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> and deposited with the quartermaster, he obtained a copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>That book had strengthened his impressions, but he was not aware to what extent the truth had taken hold of him till he read that tract; then he gave up, and the next thing was that visit to us. I have never conversed with <num value="1">one</num> thus seeking the way of life in whom the feeling of His need of light and grace, the sense of all spiritual necessity was deeper, or in whom the single anxiety to get to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00373.04117" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> and be His, and have the hope of His salvation, was more thoroughly absorbing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>His docility and humbleness of spirit in receiving instruction, his literal thirst after it, were very striking.</p></div2>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>After I had given him instruction, and prayed with him, he became tranquil; he began to speak of his circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.374" n="374"/> known instance in the history of the academy of a cadet having come out and taken position as a follower of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00374.04119" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>He considered how he would be wondered at and observed, and by some ridiculed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>He felt deeply the need of the greatest circumspection and strength from above, lest he should not walk consistently with the new life on which he now sought to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>It was <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>; next Sunday he would attend Divine worship as he had never attended before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>It would get abroad in the corps that this great change had come over his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>He would be watched in the chapel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>He reflected that in no instance had ever a cadet knelt in the service, and, so far as was remembered, no officer, <rs type="role" n="Professor">professor</rs>, or instructor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>The chapel was then so small that the cadets sat on benches without backs, and were so crowded together that it was very difficult for any to kneel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>He asked me what he ought to do, not having the slightest idea of shrinking from any confession of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00374.04120" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in word or deed that might be duty, and yet modest and far from a disposition to make himself unnecessarily an object of observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4976"/>I said he had better begin at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>The next day, when the confession in the service came, I could hear his movement to get space to kneel, and then his deep tone of response as if he was trembling with new emotion, and then it seemed as if an impression of solemnity pervaded all the congregation.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.25.212" type="section" n="c.25.212"> 
<head>A New sight.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>It was a new sight, that single kneeling cadet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>Such a thing had not been supposed to be possible as a cadet that turned to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>From that time he grew rapidly in spiritual knowledge, and in the consolation of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00374.04121" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>He came to Him as a lost sinner; he sought refuge in Him and found peace with <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; his mind soon became peaceful and happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>Such was the carefulness and consistency of his walk, so manifestly had he become a new man, with a new heart, and a new life begun, and yet so wisely and inoffensively did he go in and out with those around him, that I never heard of any who doubted his sincerity or gainsayed the reality of his conversion, and did not regard him with respect for entire consistency of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>There was that in his previous standing in the corps which gave his example a special impressiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4984"/>He had been among his comrades a gay, high-spirited youth, not much given to study, not over careful of obedience to the interior discipline of the corps, not unwilling to join in certain not perfectly temperate frolics with his companions; popular among them, and regarded as of such high gentlemanly <pb id="p.375" n="375"/> honor and frankness that nothing mean or insincere could possibly be imputed to him.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.25.213" type="section" n="c.25.213"> 
<head>A good example.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>Cadets and officers both told me that if I had chosen out of the whole corps <num value="1">one</num> whose example in becoming a disciple of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00375.04122" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> would have the greatest effect on the minds of his fellows, I should have chosen him. The case was more impressive because not only was the conversation so decided and manifest, but it was so without man's hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>It was known how entirely it had grown up without the least conversation with any man until it was disclosed to me as related above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4987"/>It pleased <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that though the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, it was not the only instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>In the course of another week, <num value="1">one</num> and another, strangers to me, came on the same errand, each without previous conversation with anybody until he went to <persName n="Polk,Cadet,,,," id="n0276.0026.00375.04123" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> and asked him to introduce him to me.</p></div2> 
<div2 id="c.25.214" type="section" n="c.25.214"> 
<head>Meetings necessary.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>And so it went on, till I found it necessary to have meetings for them twice or thrice a week in my house for instruction, conversation and prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>Soon the number of cadets, with some professors and instructors, coming to these meetings&mdash;and be it observed that, under these circumstances, the very attendance was a profession of earnest spiritual concern&mdash;the number was so great as to wholly occupy the largest room I had, and in each instance the state of mind disclosed was of the same independent origination as described in that of <persName n="Polk,Cadet,,,," id="n0276.0026.00375.04124" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName>, coming directly from <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, no communication with man, scarcely with any book but the <name>Scriptures</name>, until it was strong enough to seek a private interview with the chaplain, and in almost every case of a cadet so coming, his chosen instructor was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> born of their brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>Into the particulars of that week of grace, the remembrance of which fills me with wonder and praise whenever I think of it, and out of which came many to confess <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00375.04125" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> before men, who walked afterwards as becometh the <name>Gospel</name>, I shall not enter here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>Some became ministers of the <name>Gospel</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>Beside those who then came forward and openly confessed <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00375.04126" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:1"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> before men, there were several who received impressions which afterwards matured into decided religious character and profession, so that from time to time, and almost to the present year, I have received new information of those whom I did not know in any such connection, but who have ascribed their subsequent <pb id="p.376" n="376"/> religious life to that beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/><persName n="Polk,Cadet,,,," id="n0276.0026.00376.04127" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> was of an Episcopal family in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, but had not been baptized in infancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>His baptism now was not hurried; due time was given him to try and examine himself, and know it was no mere sudden impulse of excitement that had taken possession of him. <measure n="40days" type="date">Forty days</measure> after my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> interview with him, on <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="1826-05-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1826</year>,</dateStruct> he was baptized in the chapel, at morning prayer, in the presence of the corps and an unusually large attendance of officers and professors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>Another cadet, <persName n="Magruder,,William,B.,," id="n0276.0026.00376.04128" reg="default:Magruder,William,B.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>, who still lives, was baptized at the same time.</p></div2>

<head>Adult baptism.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>The service for adult baptism had never been witnessed there before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>The circumstances made it an occasion of intense interest among the cadets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>Perceiving the intensity with which the mind of <persName n="Polk,Cadet,,,," id="n0276.0026.00376.04129" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><roleName n="Cadet">Cadet</roleName> <surname>Polk</surname></persName> was occupied in preparation for it, and apprehensive that all sorts of rumors had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> concerning what was going on at the academy&mdash;as if discipline and order and study were broken up by religion&mdash;and we had various noisy demonstrations of excitement in the chapel, rumors I need not say without the slightest appearance of foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>Apprehensive, I say, lest under some strength of emotion my young friend should afford the least excuse for such reports, I charged him to be on his guard, and he promised.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>All went on quietly but with the deepest solemnity, till after the last words of the baptismal office, when I addressed a few words of exhortation to the <num value="2">two</num>, ending with the sentence: <q direct="unspecified">Pray your Master and Saviour to take you out of the world, rather than allow you to bring reproach on the cause you have now professed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>Then he could hold no longer, and there came from the depth of his heart an Amen, which spoke to every other heart in the congregation and is remembered to this day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/>That Amen was recently renewed in my recollection by a letter from a gentleman, a stranger to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>He remembered the very words as given above, and he said that <num value="1">one</num> of the cadets responded to them with an Amen, so deep-toned and so uttered as if all his soul were in it, that it made a deep impression on him, and he had the sound of it yet in his ears, and he said he had an impression that <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="2">two</num> was named <persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n0276.0026.00376.04131" reg="nearbymention:Polk,Leonidas,,,"><surname>Polk</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/>When he knocked at his friend's door the latter was on his knees praying for him, and when he arose and found who it was at the door, was not surprised, but well divined his errand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>Each fact or statement in a report, or a letter, or in an editorial, has been separately entered in the journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>This portion of the work requires a journal of <num value="800">eight hundred</num> pages to comprise an epitome of each volume of the <q direct="unspecified">Record.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>All are related with impartial completeness from all available sources of information, and will be found to satisfy all inquiry instantaneously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5191"/>So rapid had been our advance, that the men were not only badly <pb id="p.392" n="392"/> scattered and disorganized, but we had far outstripped in distance the supports on our wings, and were rushing wildly upon the enemy, who quietly and coolly awaited our coming; in fact, had so far anticipated us as to place their infantry supports in a commanding position immediately behind the battery, and had thrown out on the right and left in front another body of infantry, thus laying a trap into which they felt satisfied we would fall, and in which expectation they were not disappointed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5639"/><pb id="p.423" n="423"/> The pleasure of acknowledging such historical discussion is enhanced, when, as is the case with the matter in hand, the foreign writer is an old friend of the <rs>South</rs>, who evinced his interest, in the first place, by a visit to us during the war, and since that time has shown his zealous interest by several books and papers relating to us and our history.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5640"/>The name and presence of <persName n="Scheibert,Major,J.,,," id="n0276.0035.00423.04430" reg="default:Scheibert,J.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Scheibert</surname></persName>, of the <name>Prussian</name> <orgName type="mil" key="EngCorps">Engineer Corps</orgName>, will be remembered by many old soldiers of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, with which this accomplished <name>German</name> officer saw some service during the <rs>Chancellorsville</rs> and <rs>Gettysburg</rs> campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5641"/>The respect and esteem won for himself while here is evinced by the friendly admiration in which his name and memory are yet held by his comrades and acquaintances of that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5642"/>The results of his observations and the impressions made during that sojourn among us were embodied in a little volume (<q direct="unspecified">Sieben Monate in den Rebellen Staaten</q>), published in <dateStruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>; a work marked by such good sense and power of observation that it well deserves translation as a valuable contribution to the history of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5643"/>Subsequently, in <dateStruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></dateStruct>, there came from his pen a volume of military studies of the war (<q direct="unspecified">Der Burgerkrieg in <persName n="Amerika,,N.,,," id="n0276.0035.00423.04431" reg="default:Amerika,N.,,,"><foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Amerika</surname></persName></q>), in which the <rs>Major</rs> does justice and pays intelligent tribute to the ability and skill of our leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5644"/>The value of this work, as an able discussion, from a military standpoint, of the subject treated, may be inferred from its esteem abroad, where its importance as a professional treatise is evidenced by the fact that a society of <name>French</name> officers deemed it worthy of translation into their language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5645"/>Intelligent criticism is always to be welcomed, even if it sometimes discovers our faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5646"/>The more welcome is it, of course, when it resolves itself, as <persName n="Scheibert,Major,,,," id="n0276.0035.00423.04432" reg="nearbymention:Scheibert,J.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scheibert</surname></persName>'s comments often do, into a eulogy of our people, and finds so much to admire in the splendid abilities and achievements of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0276.0035.00423.04433" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his fellow-officers and soldiers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5647"/>In a Berlin journal of recent date <persName n="Scheibert,Major,,,," id="n0276.0035.00423.04434" reg="nearbymention:Scheibert,J.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scheibert</surname></persName> has again contributed a series of articles to the literature of the subject, and in a manner that entitles him anew to our respect and gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5648"/>In this latest utterance he has attempted to enlighten the dense ignorance of his fellow-countrymen on the historical and political questions of our great controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5649"/>In an admirable series of short studies of the subject, these questions and the material facts of our history are presented in a light that is doubtless new and surprising to his readers; who, getting their ideas of American history from partisan sources bitterly hostile to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and all it represented, have generally <pb id="p.424" n="424"/> looked upon us with the feelings of contempt meted to <q direct="unspecified">Rebels,</q> in the <rs>European</rs> sense of that word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5650"/>In a brief <hi rend="italics">resume</hi> of our history, tracing it down from the <name>Colonial</name> period to the adoption of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and thence to the outbreak of the war in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Scheibert,Major,,,," id="n0276.0035.00424.04435" reg="nearbymention:Scheibert,J.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scheibert</surname></persName> cites the facts and states the arguments, so familiar to us, but unknown and novel to the vast majority of his countrymen; and from these facts and arguments shows how unmeaning and absurd is the stigma of <q direct="unspecified">Rebels,</q> as applied to the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5651"/>In reciting this history for the enlightenment of his countrymen, he had not only to meet and counteract the belief, almost universal among <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> nations, that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> was the <hi rend="italics">casus belli</hi>, but also to refute the assumption that the emancipation of a down-trodden race and the achievement for them of human freedom were the original purpose and direct intention of the war on the part of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5652"/>In the opinion of probably <num value="9">nine</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> foreigners the <rs>Southern</rs> people were, and are, regarded as the inhuman oppressors of their fellow-beings, the champions of a detested cause, alike hostile to the spirit of American institutions and opposed to the genius of modern freedom and civilization.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5653"/>It is not necessary in this notice to repeat to readers familiar with the history the facts and arguments by which <persName n="Scheibert,Major,,,," id="n0276.0035.00424.04436" reg="nearbymention:Scheibert,J.,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scheibert</surname></persName> shows the groundlessness and falsity of such an assumption and such charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5654"/>It is, however, a pleasure to express our satisfaction and gratitude that the studies of at least <num value="1">one</num> German of intellect and character have supplied him with the facts and arguments of the case, and that his friendly zeal has prompted his utterance in an attempt to prove to his countrymen the co-equal responsibility of the <rs>North</rs> for the original institution and continued existence of slavery in this country, and to show that emancipation followed the war, not as the original intention and purpose of the <rs>Northern</rs> government, but as a measure of military and political expediency, that was disowned and denounced at the time of and even after the outbreak of the war. The prejudice against us, prevalent among <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> peoples, was the foundation of that hostile public opinion that enlisted against us the so-called moral sentiment of the world, from which it followed that practically we were fighting the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5655"/>It is highly probable that the results of this foreign prejudice, favorable to the enemy but pregnant with threats to us, were so disastrous as to nullify the effects of splendid victories and achievements on our part, and it is no exaggeration to say that they multiplied the privations and sufferings of every man, woman and child in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5656"/><pb id="p.425" n="425"/></p> 
<p>Despite, however, this adverse opinion, so prejudicial to us, intelligent thinkers in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have been puzzled to account for the display of intellect, courage and devotion exhibited during <num value="4">four</num> long years in the achievements and endurance of a people whom they have been taught to look on as a horde of semi-barbarous rebels.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/></p> 
<p>Besides the differences of race and religion, nature itself, through the varied geograpical position of the <name>States</name> had created relations of such varied character that: not only must conflict ensue, but the least law affecting the whole Union often aroused diametrically and sharply opposed interests; the consequences of which were to embitter sectional opinions to an intolerable degree.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>When the <rs>North</rs> demanded tariff protection for their industries as against <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> competition, the <rs>Southern States</rs> insisted upon free trade, so as not to be compelled to buy the costly products of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States strove for concentration of power in the national government; the <name>Southerners</name> believed that the independence of the individual States must be maintained, and when the <name>Southerners</name> demanded protection for their labor, which was performed by imported negroes, the <rs>North</rs> answered with evasion of the laws, while, in direct opposition to these laws, it denied to the master the right to his escaped negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5662"/>From any point of view, there existed, and exist to-day, interests almost irreconcilably opposed, which make it difficult for the most earnest student of <orgName type="college" n="American college">American</orgName> affairs to find the certain clew in such a tangled labyrinth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5663"/>The difficulty in the present undertaking is to make good the fact that the so-called Confederates, who have been by almost all <name>German</name> writers represented as <quote>Rebels,</quote> stood firm upon a ground of right and law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5664"/>If the central government at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 8" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> was the soverign power, then the (Southern) States were in the wrong, and their citizens were simply rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5665"/>If, on the other hand, the individual States were separate and sovereign political bodies, then their secession, independent <pb id="p.426" n="426"/> of considerations of expediency or selfishness, was a politically justifiable withdrawal from a previous limited alliance; and in this case it was the duty of citizens of the <name>States</name> to go with their States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5666"/>As a proper consequence of these different views, the <rs>Federals</rs> considered as a traitor every citizen who opposed the central government, however his individual State may have determined; while the <rs>Confederates</rs>, after the declaration of war on the part of the <rs>Union</rs>, looked on the <name>Federalists</name> indeed as enemies, but considered as traitors only those citizens, who, in opposition to the vote of their States, yet adhered to the <rs>Union</rs>. * * * * * * Instead of enquiring into emotion and sympathies, the question is an historical <num value="1">one</num> as to the origin of the <rs>Union</rs>; that is, to seek in the founding of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in what relation&mdash;at that time&mdash;the <name>States</name> stood to the central government, the mode of their covenant, and how the relation of the several States to the common union was developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5667"/>The colonies, therefore, united not because the citizens in general were oppressed by the <rs>British Government</rs>, but because <num value="1">one</num> colony felt, whether rightly or not, that it was oppressed and insulted as an independent political body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5668"/>In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement of independence was exhibited clearly the conciousness that the colonies felt themselves separate political bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>Even at that time the assembly of delegates designated itself as a congress of <q direct="unspecified"><num value="12">twelve</num> independent political bodies,</q> and in this Union each of the colonies issued its separate declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>In <dateStruct value="1775-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>, the delegates of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> colonies met in their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> congress, in which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> permanent Union was founded; which was ratified by each colony as a separate body, as <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> they entered the <rs>Union</rs>, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>Let us suppose, by way of illustration, that <name>German</name> citizens with the best good will to the <rs>Empire</rs>, yet found that intolerable differences, year by year, bred contention and bitterness; that Prussians, Suabians or Bavarians, or any group of States, should determine on separation from the <rs>Empire</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>Such separation might be condemned as unpatriotic, inopportune, and unloyal, and an attempt might be made by force of arms to bring back the seceded members to the <rs>Empire</rs>, but no <num value="1">one</num> would denounce as traitors the individual <rs>Prussians</rs>, Suabians or Bavarians, because, as citizens of their respective fatherlands, they have submitted to the decision of their individual States&mdash;Prussia, Wurtemburg or <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>The odium would be cast upon the <name>States</name>, and not on the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>And yet a great part of the <name>German</name> press has not hesitated to brand as traitors to their <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> country such men as <persName n="Lee,General,R.,E.,," id="n0276.0035.00427.04439" reg="expanded:Lee,Robert,Edward,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>&mdash;men of the highest honor, who, though with heavy heart, but followed the lead of their mother State.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>If for clearer statement of the argument the <rs>German Empire</rs> is cited as an illustration, it must yet be expressly observed that the several States of the <rs>Union</rs> had much more right to withdraw from the common alliance than the members of the <rs>German Empire</rs> will ever have; for the latter are united with their free will, without reservation, and in loyal agreement of their lawful princes and their States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5676"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, however, were founded not only as the result of a revolution, but they have solemnly and for all time sanctioned revolution as the basis of their State structure, as witness the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5677"/>Language could not be clearer in pointing the way for the guidance of American citizens dissatisfied with their government; so clearly is it prescribed that <hi rend="italics">there can be no doubt</hi> of a <hi rend="italics">moral justification</hi> of such a step for the citizens; and, if these have the power and majority in their several States, there is an equal moral right in the <name>States</name> to change a government whose misdeeds and usurpations, in their opinion, threaten them with despotism. * * * * * * *</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5678"/>At most the question to be decided is, whether the dissatisfactions were light and transient, or whether the usurpations were intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5679"/>The Southern States believed the latter to be the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5680"/>We may not here anticipate the judgment of later and impartial history, but we must distinctly maintain, in accordance with the clear tenor of the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, that even if the uneasiness were inconsiderable, the <name>States</name> have at most acted unwisely, but in no case as traitors or rebels. * * * * With the question as to the origin of the war, the enemies of the <rs>South</rs> have mingled another&mdash;the slavery question&mdash;which strictly does not belong to it. This slavery question was inscribed on the banners of the war, when it was seen that thereby could be enlisted on the side of the <rs>North</rs> the sympathies of the old world, and of a great part of their own inhabitants, especially of the <name>German</name> immigrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5681"/>This question could never legally be the cause of the war, for the <rs>Constitution</rs> expressly says that the question of slavery should be regulated by the <rs>State</rs> legislatures. * * * * At the time of the founding of the <rs>Union</rs>, <num value="11">eleven</num> of the <num value="13">thirteen</num> States were slave-holding, and it is a remarkable fact that it then occurred to no writer nor humanitarian in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> even to think that this ownership (of slaves) was a wrong or a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5682"/>It is enough to say that the institution was accepted not only <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> as a matter of course, but that it was also especially protected, the farming interest being granted an increased suffrage in proportion to the number of negroes on their plantations. * * * * * Even in the last days, before the outbreak of war, when the press and demagogues raised the slavery question in order to inflame the masses, the statesman (of the <rs>North</rs>) carefully avoided such a blunder, since the slavery question was not the ground of the war, and could not be proclaimed as such.</p></quote> </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5784"/>The following night after taps, when every prisoner was in bed, a file of soldiers rushed into the nearest cook-house to the scene and hurried the <num value="32">thirty-two</num> inmates out in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5785"/>The weather was intensely cold-thermometer below zero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5786"/>They had on nothing but shirt and drawers&mdash;<num value="2">two</num> of them had on socks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5787"/>They were placed in a block&mdash;house which had a door and a hole a few inches wide, without food, water or fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>During that day of cruel mocking there was <num value="1">one</num> kind man who visited the suffering prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5807"/>He, however, stated that on the evening the guard was killed he was at the wood-pile gathering some chips for the fire when he was hit on the leg by the brick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/>Smarting with pain he threw the brick back and hit the guard on the head, and he fell off the parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>Whether, said the young man, the brick or the whiskey in the guard caused the fall and death he could not say; for, said he, the guard was drunk that afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>Then the young man added, I am sorry that I did not know that you were bestowing this cruelty on these men, for I should have come forward and made known these things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/>The <num value="32">thirty-two</num> were immediately sent back to their quarters, where they were clothed and fed, but <num value="3">three</num> of them died soon after from this <pb id="p.435" n="435"/> exposure, and most of them had impaired health.
