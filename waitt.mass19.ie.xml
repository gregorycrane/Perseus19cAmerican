<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> spring the men had seen since leaving <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>, and it can readily be imagined with what pleasure they filled their canteens out of the sparkling pool.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Here the men lay in the cool shade, listening to the thunders of artillery and the rattle of musketry, expecting every minute to be ordered into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>There was no sport or loud talk indulged in, conversation being carried on in low tones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/>The very air seemed oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/>Everyone seemed to realize the terrible work that was being done beyond the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>At about noon an aide of the brigade commander galloped into the woods <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> and rode up to the colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Immediately the order was given to fall in and the regiment went on the double-quick over gravelly roads, through plowed fields, through mud, stream and swamp until they halted within sight of the smoke of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/>There they met dozens of stragglers and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>Some brought tales of disaster and woe, but others, later, told of victory achieved, and then, under the hot sun, the regiment was ordered back by <persName n="Sedgwick,General,,,," id="n0170.0010.00075.00483" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,John,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName> and returned at a rapid pace to the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Grape Vine Bridge">Grape Vine Bridge</placeName>,</q> where it was placed on guard.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>What a sight met their eyes as the men took their position&mdash; knapsacks, haversacks, overcoats, blankets and surplus clothing of every kind strewed the ground in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>Most of the wounded had been removed and the <rs>Union</rs> dead buried, but the ground was covered in every direction with the swollen corpses of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="982"/>Their faces were turned black under the hot sun and swelled almost to bursting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>It was horrible to look upon, and the stench was almost unbearable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="988"/>Before night it began to rain and there the regiment lay in line of battle all night, the water covering most of the ground, with muskets loaded and capped, ready for the enemy should they come out of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="989"/>There were numerous shots fired by the pickets during the night and this kept everyone under an intense nervous strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="990"/>At <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> in the morning the regiment was called to attention and remained standing until daylight, when arms were stacked and they were allowed to move around a little and prepare breakfast of coffee, hardtack and raw pork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="991"/>In front was an open space, in the further edge of which, about <measure n="2000feet" type="distance">2000 feet</measure> away, was the picket line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>In front of the pickets were dense woods filled with an undergrowth which made it impossible to see <measure n="50feet" type="distance">50 feet</measure> in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>About half a mile away, a breastwork of logs and bushes was built across it, and behind this were the rebel pickets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="996"/>While stationed at this point, the rebel pickets and skirmishers would advance every few hours and the whole Union line would fall in, expecting to see a line of battle come out of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="997"/>Here the shelter tents were brought up and the men made themselves as comfortable as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/>All about the position were the shallow graves of those who had been killed in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/>The air was heavy with noisome odors from the hundreds of decomposing bodies half-buried in the immediate vicinity, and it was little wonder that sickness and deaths increased to an alarming extent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>Their muskets were always by their side while sleeping and stacked in front of the tent during the day. At <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> every morning the regiment was <pb id="p.77" n="77"/> routed out and formed in line, remaining there until daylight so as to be ready for the enemy should they appear out of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>This was an additional hardship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/>Aroused from a sound sleep, the nights were damp and cold and the inactivity made it the more intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>At these times each man was served with about <num value="0.5">a half</num> a gill of whiskey and quinine from a bucket,&mdash; this being done to keep off the malaria.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>It rained constantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Orders were given once a week to allow the men to change their underclothing, taking turns at it a few at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>Occasionally permission would be given to unbuckle the roundabout while they slept, but the cross belt was not allowed to be removed from the shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>This constant expectation of sudden attack proved a terrible strain upon them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>Firing between the pickets was very frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Gradually the firing died out, the tension was relaxed and no attack was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>These sudden alarms occurred often and were responsible for the broken down and shattered nervous systems of many of the men who received no wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>Shells from the enemy's batteries were frequently sent over into the <rs>Union</rs> lines and the compliment would immediately be returned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The rations here were, for a time, very poor,&mdash;a scant allowance of hard bread, coffee twice a day (sometimes none, however) and occasionally fresh or salted beef.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>There seemed to be no good reason for this scarcity of food, for the army was encamped by the side of the railroad, which it held, with trains running from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>. <num value="1">One</num> or <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> of scurvy appeared in the regiment and there were fears that it would spread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>About the middle of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>, however, a change for the better was made and food was more abundant and better in quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>At times the artillery or cavalry, discovering the road clear, would <q direct="unspecified">heave ahead,</q> clattering over the ground to make a <q direct="unspecified">lap,</q> arousing the sleepers, burying them in dust and worrying their own poor horses who were equally as tired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>Little by little, the trees seemed smaller and further apart and evidently the top of the hill was not far away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/>Here and there a farmhouse and other buildings dotted the landscape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/>The hill where the regiment stood seemed to extend to the right around the valley and encircle it entirely, except for a little opening on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1659"/>Just a moment's halt for breath was given and then the descent was begun, at a much faster pace than that at which the ascent had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1660"/>Although it seemed but a step across the valley it was in reality several miles by the winding road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1661"/>Before the regiment reached the foot of the hill, it was turned abruptly to the right and advanced toward the <rs>Rebel</rs> position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1662"/>Now and then the sound of musketry was heard and the artillery still kept up the firing, making good music to march by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1663"/>Across a little brook and to he other side of the valley was but a short march and the regiment soon halted in the vicinity of the troops who had been fighting that day and on the very spot where the batteries had been seen in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1667"/>The hill was very steep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1668"/>When the summit was reached a halt of some duration was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>The works on the <rs type="place">Heights</rs> were occupied by a force sufficient to require constant watchfulness by the <rs>Union</rs> troops and a frequent exchange of musket shots caused them to be kept in readiness to meet any movement of the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>Another attack was momentarily expected, but the minutes became hours and no sign was made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>Finally, the sound of heavy firing was heard far away on the right and very soon movements among the rebels indicated that something was going to happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>Just at dusk the cheers in the rebel works intimated that they had won a partial victory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>In the early part of the night it was determined to withdraw the force in <placeName key="tgn,7013943" n="1.000 22" reg="fredericksburg, fredericksburg, virginia">Fredericksburg</placeName> to the north side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>The <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> was on the right of the line and became the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>Rifle pits were dug at intervals across the street leading directly to the pontoon bridge to enable the men to resist a sudden onslaught during the night or when it came time for them to move, the hour being set for earliest dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>This accomplished, the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> was as silently withdrawn, the men through the fog, looking like ghosts on a ghastly parade as they stealthily marched along.

<p>They all felt that the enemy knew they were evacuating and would be on the alert to push the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> but were delayed by the fog.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>Some women tried to get out to the enemy, but were caught and held until there was no longer any danger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>Then came the rush of pursuing feet, through the fog.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>The enemy knew exactly the route the regiment would be compelled to take and came on pell mell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>Just as they turned the corner they were greeted with a volley which threw them into confusion and turned them back.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3243"/>It is right for me to say here that there was a disputed, and as yet unsettled, right of seniority between myself and <persName n="Mallon,Colonel,,,," id="n0170.0031.00252.02156" reg="mostcommon:Mallon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mallon</surname></persName>, but which never interfered with our cordial personal relations; and it is due to the memory of so good an officer, who died gallantly at the head of his brigade, shortly after, at <orgName n="Bristow Station" type="station">Bristow's Station</orgName>, to state that he frankly and cheerfully waived all claim on his part and obeyed my orders without reserve the balance of that day and during the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3244"/>My report, therefore, will include the operations of both regiments from here on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3245"/>Some portions of the division to our left had preceded us. On reaching the little swale, lined with willows, we met the <orgName type="regiment" key="MN1">First Minnesota</orgName> beaten back and badly handled by the enemy, but making a desperate effort to maintain their ground; their ranks were so badly cut that I easily passed through with my command, marching by the flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3246"/>We were guided by a young lieutenant on horseback, all the officers of my own command being on foot, orders having been given some time before to send all horses to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3247"/>Just as we rose the further side of the swale, everything was in direct confusion; our troops were flying in great disorder, and apparently no organization left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3248"/>Just at this moment my guide disappeared, and where he went and what became of him, I have never yet learned.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3249"/>I could find no <num value="1">one</num> to report to, and h ad to trust to my own judgement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3250"/>I formed a line of battle, <persName n="Mallon,,,,," id="n0170.0031.00252.02157" reg="mostcommon:Mallon,nomatch:0"><surname>Mallon</surname></persName> on my right, and ordered both regiments to lie down, officers and men&mdash;except myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3251"/>The enemy's line of battle followed closely in upon the flying men, and their artillery, running up to close quarters, used canister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3252"/>It seemed to me that I must preserve the organization of my command, keep it from disorder and panic, so as to use it as a nucleus for re-formation of the old line.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3253"/>I waited until my front was clear of all the broken fragments of our troops, then directed <persName n="Mallon,Colonel,,,," id="n0170.0031.00252.02158" reg="mostcommon:Mallon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Mallon</surname></persName> to make his men stand up, fire a volley by the rear and front rank in succession, then to face about and regain the old line on the double-quick, meaning thereby the old line of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName>, directly in our rear, then to halt, face about again and wait for me. After <persName n="Mallon,,,,," id="n0170.0031.00252.02159" reg="mostcommon:Mallon,nomatch:0"><surname>Mallon</surname></persName> had well left the field, I ordered my men to rise and fire a volley, also by the front and rear flank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3254"/>These successive volleys checked, to a considerable extent, the enemy's advance in our immediate front and gave me opportunity to face my men to the rear and move them toward the old line at ordinary quick time, but the enemy was so near that I was able to bring in with me several prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3255"/>In this connection, I wish to state that I have always felt that it was due to the regiment that I commanded that special mention should be made of <pb id="p.253" n="253"/> their conduct, under circumstances the most trying to soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3256"/>Their backs were to the foe, the enemy was close upon them, using canister upon us. (I lost a large percentage of my men, shot in the back.) I was between them and the enemy, directing their movements, and their line never wavered but once, when the fire on my right flank was too heavy for men to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3257"/>But <num value="1">one</num> single command from my lips and they moved as steadily as before, until we met the front line of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 5">Fifth Corps</orgName> coming up most opportunely to the rescue of the situation, when we passed through, halted and again faced to the front by the side of <orgName type="regiment" key="NY42"><persName n="Mallon,,,,," id="n0170.0031.00253.02160" reg="mostcommon:Mallon,nomatch:0"><surname>Mallon</surname></persName>'s Forty-Second New York</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3258"/>I consider no men could have been put to a severer test of true courage, thorough discipline and absolute confidence in themselves and their officers, and this regiment should receive credit for it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3259"/>After nightfall the <num value="2">two</num> regiments marched back to the position they had left the afternoon previous, but finding the gap filled in the front line, took position in the rear of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Rorty,,,,," id="n0170.0031.00253.02162" reg="mostcommon:Rorty,nomatch:0"><surname>Rorty</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, the most convenient place for use in case of need.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3550"/>The enemy's watch fires were plainly visible but a short distance away, across <placeName reg="Mine Run, Montgomery, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,1133874">Mine Run Creek</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3551"/>It was bitterly cold and heavy overcoats were hardly sufficient protection for the pickets against the high wind which came in icy blasts across the plains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3552"/>A number of pickets in the <rs>Corps</rs> froze to death upon their posts during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3553"/>The mercury was below the freezing point and thin ice formed in the creek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>The water in the canteens was solidly frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>The men were completely tired out, having had very little sleep for several nights.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>At <time value="12am">midnight</time> the pickets were called in and the <rs>Division</rs> crossed <placeName reg="Mine Run, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,2516268">Mine Run</placeName> and formed in line of battle behind a low ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>The movement <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> was made very quietly in the darkness, and each regiment was hardly conscious of the presence of the other, as the line was continued to the right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>Permission was given for the men to lie down but nothing could be unpacked and no fires whatever were allowed, not even the lighting of a match or a pipe and no loud talk or laughter could be indulged in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>For some reason the men had been siezed with the belief that the undertaking was to be <num value="1">one</num> of unusual danger and many pinned their names to their clothing to aid in the identification in case of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>The assault formed the main topic of conversation during the remainder of the night, most of which was passed in trotting up and down in the rear of the line in a vain effort to keep warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>The men did not fear death so much, but the thought of receiving a bad wound and being left to suffer in the cold and perhaps to die upon the field was not pleasant and if they looked upon the undertaking with apprehensions and misgivings, they were certainly justified in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>The feeling that there was to be some awful slaughter in the morning was very strong among the men, so strong in fact, that many called to the little drummer boys and gave to them last messages for home and confided to them trinkets they desired should be sent to the family at home in case of their being killed, as they expected to be.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="MA19">Nineteenth Massachusetts</orgName> moved a little farther into the woods and it was but a very few minutes before fires were built and the men were enjoying steaming cups of coffee and bacon broiled in the grateful heat made by the burning rails and brush-wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>Upon emerging from these woods, the column took up the line of march by the flank over the <rs type="place">Orange Plank Road</rs> to the <rs>Rapidan</rs> which was crossed at Culpepper <placeName reg="Mine Ford">Mine Ford</placeName> at daylight on the morning of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2nd</num> and the march was continued until the old camp at <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 4" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName> was reached, at about <time value="4pm">4 P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/>During the larger part of the night, the march was anything but steady, on account of the wagon trains ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3586"/>The men would rush along, sometimes almost at a double-quick, for a mile or so, stumbling over the uneven planks which, being worn or loose, were continually flying up at <num value="1">one</num> end and catching some poor fellow's toes, sending him sprawling in a heap of dust, his knapsack, filled with winter clothing, greatly accelerating his fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3589"/>Thus it was, all through that long night,&mdash;sometimes reeking with perspiration, and again shivering with the cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>In some places the woods were on fire and the smoke added to the general discomfiture.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3635"/>Accordingly after much discussion, enough agreed to re-enlist to insure our return home as a regiment.</quote></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3636"/>In justice to the veterans it should be said that a very large majority of them would have re-enlisted in any event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3637"/>The greater portion of them felt that whatever might be their legal obligations, their real term of service could only be closed by the entire suppression of the rebellion, and that while a man remained <pb id="p.284" n="284"/> in arms against the honor and authority of the nation, it was their sacred duty to remain in arms for his overthrow.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3644"/>Each of the men knew just what war was. He had experienced it, had seen his comrades swept away by shot and shell and foul disease and his regiment dwindle until only a remnant of its former strength remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3645"/>These veterans did not have in their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> enrollment the inspiration and excitement of war meetings or the novelty of new gold-trimmed uniforms to urge them on, but with a full knowledge of the duties required, the hardships to be endured, and the probability that many would either be killed or wounded before their term expired.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3881"/>The rebel works were well made; on the inner side traverses were built at short intervals for protection from cross fires,&mdash;the spaces between these were called by the men <q direct="unspecified">Horse-stalls.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3882"/>A dozen or more men could crowd into each space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3883"/>The point <pb id="p.310" n="310"/> where lay the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> marked the division between that held by the rebels and that by the <rs>Union</rs> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3884"/>From this point the line bent back for some distance in the form of a bow, around the knoll or ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3885"/>To the right was the wood through which the wild charge of the regiment had been made and in which the line extended,&mdash;but there was an open space between the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> and the woods, unoccupied by any line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3896"/>The bullets lay on the ground like hailstones and the ground was furrowed by solid shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3897"/>The bodies of several Union dead lay between the lines on the ridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3898"/>They were shot through and through by friend and foe alike, being riddled and torn to shreds by minie balls, their uniforms in rags, looking almost as if they had passed through a shoddy mill; a mangled mass of <pb id="p.311" n="311"/> flesh and cloth they lay, shaking continually as the bullets struck them from either side.</p>
