<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>Immediately on its passage a majority of the members from the northwestern part of the <rs>State</rs> withdrew from the <rs>Convention</rs>, and a movement was at once set on foot in that section to resist and nullify an act which, whether wise or unwise, was at all events undoubtedly that of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, acting as an organized commonwealth, through the highest representative body known to our institutions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>There was no pretense even of a regular election of delegates to this Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>They were appointed in some cases by public meetings, without reference to the number of qualified voters composing them, in others by papers to which were appended a few signatures requesting certain persons to act as representatives, in yet others without even this faint show of respect for the principle of popular choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>The greater or smaller degree of irregularity in these proceedings is, however, of the less consequence, as it is abundantly evident that there was no shadow of legality in the whole movement from its beginning to its close.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>Hardly more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the voters took part in the election, most of those opposed to the movement regarding the whole proceeding as a farce which it would be alike unworthy and impolitic for them to countenance by participating in.

So stand the records on their face, no attempt, be it noted, having been made here to go behind them, or to reach even a conjectural estimate as to the proportion of these affirmative votes obtained by illegitimate methods&mdash;by corruption of various kinds, by fraud, by intimidation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>The Legislature of what was called the reorganized government of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, sitting within the limits of the proposed State, and representing, so far as they could properly be said to represent any at all, substantially the same people with those therein included, gave their consent, in the character of legislators of the old State, to what they themselves had done, as agents in the formation of the new. <pb id="p.42" n="42"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>The Constitution thus adopted and ratified was then submitted to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>The same clause of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, however, which requires the consent of that body to the erection of a new State within the jurisdiction of any member of the <rs>Union</rs>, requires not less clearly the consent of the <name>Legislature</name> of the latter also.

<p>There must be limits to quotation, or it would be easy to cite utterances of prominent Northern politicians and leading Northern journals down to the very eve of the actual conflict, protesting in the strongest terms against the coercion which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was thus peremtorily called upon to take part in. Coolly and impartially considered, indeed, the doctrine of State-sovereignty will be found, logically speaking, absolutely irrefragable, since sovereignty must of course reside somewhere, and it will be admitted by all that, according to the fundamental principle of American polity, it cannot reside in any government whatsoever, Federal or State, governments, under this system, being viewed as simply the creatures and agents of the people, wholly without original power or authority in themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1124"/>Obviously, then, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, sovereignty resides in the people alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1125"/>The sole question remaining is, in what people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1126"/>This admits of but <num value="1">one</num> answer, since there exists no such body politic as the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, considered as a single consolidated whole, the conclusive proof being that it has never, as is easy to verify historically, performed <num value="1">one</num> solitary act in that character, and indeed cannot, having no organ through which it could so speak or act. There is no representative body, standing to it in the relation in which a Convention stands to the people of a State, by means of which sovereignty might be exercised, nor is there even any possible mode of taking its sense as a whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1127"/>In the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, therefore, the ultimate seat of sovereignty is to be found in the peoples of the several States, acting as political communities, through such bodies (in the nomenclature of politics called Conventions) as they may empower to act in their name and behalf.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1128"/>Men are not apt to be cool and logical in a crisis like that which preceded the great conflict of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, yet it would seem, whatever their constitutional views, that the dominant party might have better recollected, not only the traditional American doctrine so closely interwoven with the life and history of the country, but the comparatively recent declarations of the man whom they had just placed at the head of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1131"/>Nor is this right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can, may revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1133"/></p> 
<p>Not the <rs>Constitution</rs> alone, but the whole spirit of the <rs>American Revolution</rs>, and of the institutions founded on it, was palpably violated and set at naught by the war undertaken against the seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1134"/>If governments were still to be imposed by force upon reluctant peoples, fitted for freedom, and capable of self-rule, the principles of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> were abandoned, and their work nullified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1135"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> might as well follow the <rs>Constitution</rs> into the political lumber-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1136"/>This was too evident to escape the observation of many even among the party in power at the <rs>North</rs>, but the old despotic theories, while discarded in name, had sunk deeply into the souls of men. The precedents of century on century had so thoroughly associated the idea of unquestioned power with <q direct="unspecified">government,</q> and unquestioning submission with <q direct="unspecified">governed,</q> especially among that large class who,&mdash;immigrants themselves or the sons of immigrants,&mdash;had not yet shaken off the traditions and influence of the old world, and comprehended very imperfectly, if at all, the complex and highly developed polity under which they lived, that it seemed impossible to disjoin them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1137"/>Of the <num value="1">one</num> people on earth which possessed a government resting solely upon consent the greater part were so little capable of realizing and acting up to the principles which formed the justification, the very reason for existence, of their institutions, that they blindly destroyed it, and erected on its ruins a successor of the old type, built on the old barbarous foundation of physical force, the <q direct="unspecified">right divine,</q> of the strongest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1138"/>It was a distinct and long step backward in the evolution of society, and would hardly have been taken, had the decision depended exclusively upon the descendants of the men of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1139"/>Should it be alleged that the end which sanctified such means, in the eyes of those employing them, was the swift and certain destruction of slavery, the conclusive answer is to be found in their own repeated and emphatic disavowals <pb id="p.59" n="59"/> of any such design, and in the course which they actually pursued with regard to it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1140"/>It is tempting and would be easy, did circumstances allow, to add proof to proof and illustration to illustration, but this is not the place to pursue the subject farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1141"/>Strictly speaking, indeed, it is not necessary, for the vindication of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s course, to enter upon the question of right at all. For this purpose it is amply sufficient that the constitutional views which she has consistently supported in the forum and on the field, <hi rend="italics">semper et ubique</hi>, were honestly entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1142"/>No mind, not blinded by passion and prejudice to such an extent as to be proof against any force of evidence, could doubt this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1143"/>The strongest motives that can appeal to the lower and more material side of human nature concurred to impel her to their abandonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1144"/>Neither states nor men court martyrdom in defence of opinions insincerely professed, or even laxly and superficially held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1145"/>So patent was this that it has actually been made a subject of reproach to her by <persName n="Blaine,Mister,,,," id="n0284.0004.00059.00632" reg="mostcommon:Blaine,J.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blaine</surname></persName>. <q direct="unspecified"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>,</q> says he (<measure n="20Years" type="date">Twenty Years</measure> of Congress, <ref n="volume 1" targOrder="U">Vol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1147"/>Unquestionably, in whatever way the contest on which she was entering might end, it could not but bring to her incalculable loss and suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1148"/>Even if victorious, she must, as a border State, be left in a most exposed and dangerous situation, while a large portion of her property would in any event be lost or rendered utterly insecure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1149"/>All this she saw in full prospect before her, yet she <q direct="unspecified">could not be restrained</q> by any fear of consequences, however certain and terrible, from standing firmly in adversity by the principles she had professed in prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1151"/>At the <q direct="unspecified">parting of the ways</q> she did not choose the broad and gently sloping high-road of safety and self-interest, but the narrow and painfully ascending path marked out by duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>She proved herself still the same commonwealth which nearly a century before, in the cause of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, had braved the power of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>When the choice was placed before her, she deliberately elected rather to suffer wrong than to inflict it, to take the incalculably weaker side which she believed to be just rather than the stronger which she believed to be unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1154"/>History records no nobler act of any people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1155"/>To the latest generation of her children it will descend as a proud <pb id="p.60" n="60"/> memory, and a source of heroic inspiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>Nor will honest and candid adversaries withhold their tribute of hearty admiration, for they can not doubt that she acted strictly in accordance with her conscientious convictions, however widely these may have differed from their own. Whenever there is a failure to recognize the moral grandeur of her attitude, it is simply an instance of <q direct="unspecified">the eye seeing in all things what it brought with it, the faculty of seeing,</q> and that only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1157"/>The natural consequence of a complete lack of the heroic element is a lack also of faculty to discern it in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>A more paltry, pitifully ignoble view of a great question than that indicated in the extract from <persName n="Blaine,Mister,,,," id="n0284.0004.00060.00634" reg="mostcommon:Blaine,J.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blaine</surname></persName> given above could hardly be conceived.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1159"/>The constitutional doctrine supported by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 12" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> at this crisis had been constantly maintained by her from the date of her accession to the <rs>Union</rs> downward.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, the enemy's fleet was reported off the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/><pb id="p.169" n="169"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the fleet opened very heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, during the furious bombardment on the fort, the enemy was allowed to land, without molestation, and to throw up a light line of field works from Battery <persName n="Ramseur,,,,," id="n0284.0011.00169.01702" reg="mostcommon:Ramseur,nomatch:0"><surname>Ramseur</surname></persName> to the river, thus securing his position from molestation, and making the fate of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, under the circumstances, but a question of time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the fire on the fort reached a pitch of fury to which no language can do justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>It was concentrated on the land face and front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>In a short time, nearly every gun was dismounted or disabled, and the garrison suffered severely by the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>At <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> the enemy's land force, which had been gradually and slowly advancing, formed into <num value="2">two</num> columns for assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>The garrison, during the fierce bombardment, was not able to stand to the parapets, and many of the reinforcements were obliged to be kept at a great distance from the fort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2611"/>As the enemy slackened his fire to allow the assault to take place, the men hastily manned the ramparts and gallantly repulsed the right column of assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>A portion of the troops on the left had also repelled the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rush to the left of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>The greater portion of the garrison being, however, engaged on the right, and not being able to man the entire work, the enemy succeeded in making a lodgment on the left flank, planting <num value="2">two</num> of his regimental flags in the traverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2614"/>From this point we could not dislodge him, though we forced him to take down his flag from the fire from our most distant guns, our own traverses protecting him from such fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2615"/>From this time it was a succession of fighting, from traverse to traverse, and from line to line, until <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> at night, when we were overpowered and all resistance ceased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2616"/>The fall, both of the general and the colonel commanding the fort, <num value="1">one</num> about <num value="4">4</num> and the other about <time value="4:30pm">4.30 P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2617"/>The enemy's loss was very heavy, and so, also, was our own. Of the latter, as a prisoner, I have not been able to ascertain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2618"/>At <time value="9pm">9 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2620"/>On reaching <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> there it was found to be evacuated; by whose orders or what authority, I know not; no boats were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2621"/>The garrison of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> had been coolly abandoned to its fate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2622"/>Thus fell <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, after <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> battle, unparallelled in the annals of the war. Nothing was left but to await the approach of the enemy, who took us about <time value="10pm">10 o'clock P. M.</time> The fleet surpassed its tremendous efforts in the previous attack.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2623"/>The fort has fallen in precisely the manner indicated so often by myself, and to which your attention has been so frequently called, and in the presence of the ample force provided by you to meet the contingency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2624"/>The fleet never attempted to enter until after the land force had done its work, and, of course, unless the supporting force played its part, <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> must have fallen Making every allowance for the extraordinary vigor and force of the enemy's assault, and the terrific effect of the fire of the fleet upon the garrison, and the continual and incessant enfilading of the whole point from <orgName n="Battery Buchanan" type="battery">Battery Buchanan</orgName> to the fort, thereby preventing, to a great extent, the movement of my troops, I think that the result might have been avoided, and <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> still held, if the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> had done his duty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2625"/>I charge him with this loss; with neglect of duty, in this, that he either refused or neglected to carry out any suggestion made to him, in official communications by me, for the disposition of the troops, and especially that he, failing to appreciate the lesson to be derived from the previous attempt of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0284.0011.00170.01706" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:2"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, instead of keeping his troops in the position to attack the enemy on his appearance, he moves them <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> from the point of landing, in spite of repeated warning.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2626"/>He might have learned from his failure to interrupt either the landing or the embarking of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0284.0011.00170.01707" reg="mostcommon:Butler,B.,F.,,:2"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, with his troops, though disgraceful enough, would indicate to the enemy that he would have the same security for any future expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2627"/>The previous failure was due to <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> alone, and not to any of the supporting troops.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2628"/>I charge him, further, with making no effort whatever to create a diversion, in favor of the beleagured garrison, during the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> battle, by attacking the enemy; though that was to be expected, since his delay and false disposition, allowed the enemy to secure his rear by works&mdash;but works of no strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2629"/>I desire that a full investigation be had of this matter, and these charges which I make; they will be fully borne out by the official records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2630"/><pb id="p.171" n="171"/></p> 
<p>I have only to add, that the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> on learning of the approach of the enemy, would give me no orders whatever; and persistently refused from the beginning, to allow me to have anything to do with the troops from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0284.0011.00171.01708" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2635"/>On his reply, that it would be necessary to refer it to <persName n="Grant,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n0284.0011.00171.01712" reg="mostcommon:Grant,U.,S.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, I concluded to postpone the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2636"/>I wish to add a few remarks upon the difference between the <num value="2">two</num> attacks, and also give some information which I have acquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2637"/>Had the enemy assaulted the work on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack he would have been beaten off with great slaughter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2638"/>The fire of the fleet on that occasion, though very severe and formidable, was very diffuse and scattered, seemingly more designed to render a naval entrance secure, than a land attack, consequently our defense was but slightly damaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2639"/>We had <num value="19">nineteen</num> guns bearing on the assault, and above all the palisade was almost as good as new. Moreover, the fleet, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bombardment, hauled off at night, giving the garrison time for rest, cooking, and refreshment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2640"/>It is remarkable, that during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bombardment, no gun's crew was ever driven from its gun; but on the <dateStruct value="-01-13"><day reg="13">13th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-01-14"><day reg="14">14th</day> <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, the fleet stationed itself with the definite object of destroying the land defence by direct and enfilade fire; the latter, a <hi rend="italics">feu d'enfilement</hi> to knock down the traverses, destroying all guns and pound the northeast salient into a practicable slope for the assaulting column.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2641"/>By <time value="12mid">12 M.</time> <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, not a gun remained on the land front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2642"/>The palisade was entirely swept away, and the mines in advance, so deeply did the enemy's shot plough, were isolated from the wires, <pb id="p.172" n="172"/> and could not be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2643"/>Not a man could show his head in that infernal storm, and I could only keep a lookout in the safest position to inform me of the movements of the enemy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2644"/>Contrary to previous practice, the enemy kept up the fire all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2645"/>Cooking was impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2646"/>The men, in great part, in <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fisher</placeName> at the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> attack, were not those of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and were much more demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2647"/>The casualties were greater, with but <num value="1">one</num> ration for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. Such was the condition when the parapets were manned on the enemy's ceasing firing for assault.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2648"/>As soon as a lodgement was made at <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Shepherd,,,,," id="n0284.0011.00172.01713" reg="mostcommon:Shepherd,nomatch:0"><surname>Shepherd</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> on the left, the engineers at once threw up a strong covering-work in rear of <persName n="Fisher,,,,," id="n0284.0011.00172.01714" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><surname>Fisher</surname></persName>, and no effort of ours, against overwhelming numbers could dislodge them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2649"/>Then was the time for the supporting force, which was idly looking on only <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> off (which could see the columns on the beach), to have made an attack upon the rear of the assaulting column; at any rate, to have tried to save <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, while the garrison had hurled an assaulting column, crippled, back, and were engaged, for <measure n="6hours" type="date">six hours</measure>, with <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men vigorously assaulting it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2651"/>Once at this line, by the river bank with his <num value="3">three</num> batteries of artillery, and his whole force steadily advancing, the enemy's fleet could not have fired again, without hurting their own men. The enemy had not a single piece of artillery; altogether about <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2652"/>Pushing our batteries to <placeName reg="Camp Wyatt">Camp Wyatt</placeName> and <placeName><persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n0284.0011.00172.01716" reg="nearbymention:Lamb,William,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, and opening heavily on <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Shepherd,,,,," id="n0284.0011.00172.01717" reg="mostcommon:Shepherd,nomatch:0"><surname>Shepherd</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, with an advance of our troops, and such of the enemy as could not have escaped in boats, must have fallen into our hands; but it was not to be.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2653"/>I went into the fort with the conviction that it was to be sacrificed, for the last I heard <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n0284.0011.00172.01718" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> say, was to point out a line to fall back on, if <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>It forever memorizes a cordial appreciation of the superb qualities manifested by the <rs>Confederate</rs> warriors and people during the war between the <name>States</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>Its corner stone was laid by the immortal <rs>Jefferson Davis</rs>, and is a suitable memento of the dead Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>It marks the close of an eventful era, not only in the career of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, but also in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>It defines the limit of a civilization peculiarly Southern, which, in all the attributes that bless and dignify humanity, is the crowning glory of the <rs>Christian</rs> centuries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>The people who established it were characterized by brilliant social gifts and many laudable qualities; by a generous and unstinted hospitality; by pride of race; by a sense of honor which nothing could make them forget; by a conviction that courage was absolutely essential to all true manliness, and that integrity is the fundamental law of society; by a love of liberty and a spirit of independence that no oppression or injustice could destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>They cherished an ardent devotion to the rights of the <rs>State</rs>, and an unfaltering allegiance to its authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>They possessed a chivalrous courtesy, and notable deference and delicacy in intercourse with women, who elicited the admiration of the world by their intelligence and purity and modesty and refinement, as by their capability of sacrifice and endurance of privation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>It is true that some admirable peculiarities, originating with and inseparable from our condition and system of industry, have gone, like the clouds that <persName n="Rachel,,,,," id="n0284.0012.00209.01869" reg="mostcommon:Rachel,nomatch:0"><surname>Rachel</surname></persName> watched by <persName n="Laban,,,,," id="n0284.0012.00209.01870" reg="mostcommon:Laban,nomatch:0"><surname>Laban</surname></persName>'s well, nevermore to be seen by men. This statue, representing the infantry, like the <num value="14">14</num> <pb id="p.210" n="210"/> entire structure, is an institution of education dedicated to heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>It inculcates a love of the <rs>State</rs>, and shows the honor rendered to men who encounter hardships and dangers for the liberty, independence and power of their country, and commemorates the virtues of valor and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>It will stimulate youths to admire and cultivate ennobling qualities, and to emulate, if they may not excel, the applauded virtues and glorious deeds of their ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>They thoroughly understood the limitations of our governments, both State and Federal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>They cheerfully yielded to the <rs>Union</rs> all its constitutional rights and powers, but were intensely jealous of any encroachments by the general government upon the rights of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>As the <rs>Union</rs> was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suggested by Southern statesmen, it was supported by their descendants as long as it accomplished the purposes of its formation; but when these were abandoned and the <rs>Constitution</rs> was disregarded and violated by many States, and was denounced by popular assemblies as a <q direct="unspecified">Covenant with death and a league with hell;</q> when what was intended to promote peace and tranquillity became an instrument of unfriendly agitation and hostility, the <rs>Southern States</rs> seceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>The people preferred the <rs>Constitution</rs> without the <rs>Union</rs> to the <rs>Union</rs> without the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/>They knew that the <rs>Union</rs>, unrestrained by the organic law, would be a despotism of intolerable oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>They knew, also, that the principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, wherever they obtained, secured the rights and freedom of States and of men. Therefore, to preserve them, the <rs>Southern States</rs> seceded from the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Secession was conservative of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and was a pacific policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>But war ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3222"/>Many of them formed a body of infantry, whose character and achievements have been rarely paralleled in the annals of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>No attribute of heroism, which is next to godliness, was wanting to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3224"/>They were intelligent, and fully comprehended the magnitude of the conflict and the importance of the interests involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3225"/>They knew the necessity of organization, and notwithstanding their impatience of control and stubbornness of will, they readily submitted to the stern and harsh discipline of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3226"/>Although imperfectly equipped and scantily clad, they bore, without complaint, cold and rain and sunshine and storm and sleet and hunger and the painful fatigue of long marches in wearisome campaigns, and the cruelty of barbarous <pb id="p.211" n="211"/> imprisonment and disease and wounds and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>Their patriotism was as broad as the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and as unselfish as a mother's love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>They had a conviction of the righteousness of their cause that no doubt ever disturbed; a faith in their own invincibility and a confidence in their officers that no disaster could diminish; a manly subordination to authority, and a faithfulness in the discharge of duty seldom equalled; a bravery calm as peace and reckless as fire; and a patience which willingly suffered frost and famine, whose fever gave intensity to their purpose and tireless vigils in long sieges, accompanied by the bursting of bombshells and the incessant rattle of musketry, daytime and night-time, through many tedious months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>But it was in the forlorn hope, in the desperate assault upon the enemy's works, or in the steady movement upon his lines, or in the dashing charge upon his guns in the open field, their nature most appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>Then qualities, which, like the <name>Punic</name> characters upon the sword of the <name>Icelandic</name> chieftan, were invisible in repose, like them, too, in battle and deadly peril, gleamed and glowed with a terrifying resplendence, and obtained, even in defeat, the applause our enemies won only by success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>Neither victory nor disaster could materially affect the fame of this enrolled infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>They did not change their virtues because fortune changed her face.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3233"/>These were some of the traits of the men, whose lives were as thickly strewn with battles, as their graves are strewn with flowers in spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3234"/>They were displayed by this matchless infantry, when it starved in the trenches at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>; or besieged <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName>, climbed on the hills at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> or stormed the breastworks at <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>; or assaulted the fortifications about <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>; or held the lines around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 19" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; or stood immovably at <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>; or repelled the invaders a: <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>; or drove them to the music of the rebel yell, from the field at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, or charged the heights of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3235"/>In every position and in all conditions they exhibited to the admiring gaze of the nations, the finest specimens of real, true, genuine manhood, Christian or pagan, the world has ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4203"/><num value="1">One</num> of the strongest points about <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00280.02656" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> as a preacher was that, whilst a fine scholar, and a faithful student in the preparation of his discourses, he did not shut himself up in his study or cut himself off from contact with his fellow-men, either in their business pursuits or social enjoyments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4204"/>He felt that the best way to help in lifting fallen humanity was that of the <rs>Master</rs>, <q direct="unspecified">who went about doing <pb id="p.281" n="281"/> good;</q> and hence he was a member of the <orgName n="Chamber of Commerce" type="org">Chamber of Commerce</orgName>, and was frequent in attendance at its meetings, and was also a conspicuous figure at nearly every public and private entertainment given in the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4205"/>He was a man of great public spirit, lending his influence and presence to any and every measure instituted in the community for the advancement of good or the suppression of vice, and was ever ready with his talents, time and purse to contribute to the promotion of the public weal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4206"/>He thus, in earnest desire and in sympathetic contact, saw many phases of character, and could realize contingent want as might no other minister of the <name>Gospel</name>, who followed beaten paths.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4207"/>And <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00281.02657" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> had the faculty of using these experiences in his sermons with marvelous tact and taste.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4208"/>He was really a born leader of men. He knew how to harmonize and tranquilize the conflicting elements with which he was brought in contact, as well, if not better, than any other man I have ever known, and this characteristic may doubtless account, in a great degree, for a fact which he often referred to with pride and pleasure: That, in the more than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> pastorate of <num value="1">one</num> church, there was never a disturbing element or wrangling of any kind in that church.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4209"/>His taste of manner and expression was even more wonderful, if possible, than his tact in guiding and controlling men. I never heard him say or knew him to do anything in the pulpit that was not almost rigidly clerical, and his taste of expression far surpassed that of any speaker I ever heard.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4210"/>I have heard this remarked on frequently by some of the best scholars and critics in this country, and it has been a common thing to hear it said of him that he always said the right thing, at the right time and in the right way. He had the best command of language of any man that I ever heard, and could express the most delicate shades of meaning with a fidelity and aptness that was simply wonderful.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4211"/>I cannot better illustrate the impression made by his preaching on those who were competent to judge, than by relating what was told of himself by a distinguished preacher, in a distant city, who had invited <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00281.02658" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> to preach for him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4212"/>He said that when <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00281.02659" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> arose in the pulpit, and (as was his wont) looked over the congregation, looking <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in front of him, then on <num value="1">one</num> side and finally on the other, he thought to himself: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0284.0017.00281.02660" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,A.,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, that man is sick; you will have to preach to-day.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4213"/>That <pb id="p.282" n="282"/> after thus hesitating, <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00282.02661" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> began in a low, melodious, yet distinct, tone, which could be heard in the remotest corner of the church, and after proceeding about <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>, the visited said to himself: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0284.0017.00282.02662" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,A.,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, you will not have to preach to-day;</q> and after listening <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, he said to himself: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0284.0017.00282.02663" reg="nearbymention:Jones,W.,A.,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, you never did preach in your life!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4215"/>He often preached <num value="3">three</num> sermons a day, after he had almost attained the age of <num value="4">four</num> score years.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4216"/>I have heard him say that he was sermonizing nearly all the time, and he was certainly the readiest and ripest man in his line that I ever knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4217"/>A striking illustration of this occurred whilst he was on a visit to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, not many years ago. He was stopping at the <rs type="place">Rennert Hotel</rs>, and as he was alone and it was <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, he determined to go to the nearest church to the appointed service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4218"/>It was a <orgName n="Methodist Church" type="church">Methodist church</orgName>; the services had commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4219"/>The minister had not only risen to preach but had announced his text; when some <num value="1">one</num> went to him and said that <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00282.02665" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> was in the congregation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4220"/>The preacher then invided <persName n="Hoge,Doctor,,,," id="n0284.0017.00282.02666" reg="nearbymention:Hoge,Moses,D.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hoge</surname></persName> to sit with him in the pulpit.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4224"/>Taking for his text that given out by the pastor of the church, he delivered, as has been stated to me, <num value="1">one</num> of the very best sermons ever heard in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4225"/>Within my knowledge, in several instances, when speakers for special and important occasions have been unavoidably absent, he has been asked to supply their places and I never knew him to fail in the slightest degree in any expected requirement.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>I, with a party of <num value="9">nine</num>, had flanked the right of <persName n="Pleasanton,,,,," id="n0284.0019.00306.02965" reg="mostcommon:Pleasanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pleasanton</surname></persName>'s line, and was pushing through the woods to gain the rear, when I ran into and was captured by the <orgName type="regiment" key="6NYCav">6th New York Cavalry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>I had on a pair of new boots and <num value="2">two</num> beautiful blisters on each heel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>As long as I could move, under excitement, I did not feel the pain; but when captured and made to stand still a while, I found I could not walk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>Fortunately I had been turned over to a good fellow, a sergeant in the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY6">6th New York</orgName>, who, seeing my inability to walk, gave me the privilege of riding behind him, though but a few minutes before he had his <num value="6">six</num>-shooter at my head and was about to see how much of a hole a <num value="40">40</num>-calibre bullet would make in a man's skull at a close distance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>As we rode to the rear we emerged from the woods and to our left was a large open field, in which was a <num value="6">six</num> gun battery having a picnic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>I said: <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs>, that is my branch of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>As we are not under any special orders, please ride over and let us watch the guns.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>When we arrived we found a <num value="6">six</num> gun battery of <measure n="3inch" type="distance">3-inch</measure> steel rifles&mdash;then the best gun known for field use. The guns were new, the harness, men and horses were spick and span, but they were doing some very poor shooting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>On the opposite side of the river, probably <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile or so, there was a formation of the hills, by which the road was concealed, except for what I guess was about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">200 yards</measure>. A train of wagons was attempting to pass this open space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>They would come in view <num value="1">one</num> at a time, evidently each driver would take a good start and by the time he opened up on the road his mules were going at a gallop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>I would see him standing up in his stirrups, cracking his whip and could imagine the oaths and curses he uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>I even thought I could hear some of them as some loud-mouthed fellow <pb id="p.307" n="307"/> would come in sight and make the <measure n="200yard" type="distance">200 yard'</measure>s run&mdash;such a dash as he had never made before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>As soon as the lead mules would get in sight the <rs>Yankee</rs> guns would begin, but they shot slowly and with poor effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>The <rs>Sergeant</rs> and I sat for some time watching the fun, when he said: <q direct="unspecified">Look at the guns coming out of the woods.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>I raised up eyes from the road and the demoralized drivers to a point a mile or so from where we were, back from the road probably <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile was a body of woods with a bare hill sloping to a hollow, a point probably a little over half way between the timber and the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>Out from this timber was coming a section of <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0284.0019.00307.02966" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName> at a full gallop, down the hill, over the branch, where we lost sight of them, and then coming in sight again just to the right of the point where the road was hidden by the hill.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>An infantry charge reminds you of a moving wall that cannot be resisted; a charge of cavalry stirs the blood; but I have never known excitement to equal that of a battery of artillery going into action on a full run under fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>Over the top of the hill came these <num value="2">two</num> guns, a cloud of dust almost hiding them, the horses straining every muscle, the men hanging to the horses or any part of the gun on which they could hold, those of the men that were mounted riding at full speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4551"/>When the top of the hill was reached there seemed to be no stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>The men threw themselves from their horses or fell from the guns and gathered in little squads; the guns were brought into action, and in half the time I am telling you this there was a little puff of smoke, a hoarse, shrieking sound, the sound of the explosion of the gun, and the fall of <num value="1">No. 1</num> at the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> gun, whose leg was severed from his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>The sergeant and I both broke into a simultaneous cheer, for, though an enemy, he was a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class soldier and recognized the gallant fight the <num value="2">two</num> little guns were going to put up. They looked little from our distance, but, like little men, they spoke loud, and with that sort of a sound that made <num value="1">one</num> think you hear me. The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> shot was almost as quick as that from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun and fell just in front of the battery, then a shell from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> burst over the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName>, a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> and <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> following in close succession, that, had we known then of quick-firing guns, we would have thought these rebels across the river had <num value="2">two</num> <num value="6">six</num>-pound quick-firing guns, and that the <q direct="unspecified">men behind the gulls</q> knew how to use them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>The Yankee battery was taken so much by surprise at the audacity of <num value="2">two</num> little guns daring to break up their fire on the wagons that they did not recover their balance until <persName n="Pelham,,,,," id="n0284.0019.00307.02967" reg="nearbymention:Pelham,John,,,"><surname>Pelham</surname></persName>'s guns had fired <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> rounds; then they began to <pb id="p.308" n="308"/> reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>About this time it occurred to me that I had no business there, that those rebels were no respecters of persons, and that I might get hurt, as for a long time I knew that they had no more sense than to shoot to kill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>I suggested this to the sergeant, and for once during those days the <rs>Yankee</rs> and rebel thought alike, and we not only thought quick, but we moved quickly, and soon were out of direct range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>But we could not get out of the sound of those <num value="2">two</num> little spit-fires on the other hill; it was slap-bang, slap-bang, until the sound was almost continuous.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>They got in about as many shots with <num value="2">two</num> guns as their adversary did with <num value="6">six</num>; the latter were evidently green hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>We rode back some distance, the road not being in the direct line of fire, and halted with the <orgName type="regiment" key="6NYRegiment">Sixth New York Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>In a short time&mdash;I cannot say how long, for I do not believe any man can estimate whether a battle lasts <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> or <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>&mdash;the <num value="6">six</num>-gun battery came to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4788"/>The question of the justice of the cause for which our Southern men fought and our Southern women suffered, in the great war which convulsed this country from &lsquo;<num value="61">61</num> to &lsquo;<num value="65">65</num>, will always interest the philosophical historian, <pb id="p.324" n="324"/> who will seek to know the motive that prompted the tremendous efforts of those <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and the character of the men who fought so hard.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4790"/>During that contest, and for many years after its close, there was no doubt as to this question in all our Southern land, and this is the case with nearly all our mature and thinking people to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>I fear, however, that some of our children, misled by the false teachings of certain histories used in some of our schools, may have some misgivings on this all-important subject.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>As <placeName reg="Carthage, Jefferson, New York" key="tgn,2068365">Carthage</placeName> had no historian, the <rs>Roman</rs> accounts of the famous Punic wars had to be accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4794"/>And so it has been, until recently, with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4795"/>For many years after the war, our people were so poor, and so busily engaged in <q direct="unspecified">keeping the wolf from their doors,</q> that they lost sight of everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>The shrewd, calculating, and wealthy Northerners, on the other hand, realized the importance of trying to impress the rising generation with the justice of their cause; and to that end they soon flooded our schools with histories, containing their version of the contest, and in many of these <q direct="unspecified">all the blame</q> (as in the case of <placeName reg="Carthage, Jefferson, New York" key="tgn,2068365">Carthage</placeName>), is laid on the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>In view of these facts, I have thought it not only not improper, but perhaps, a sacred duty, to call attention to some things which have impressed me very much, and some which so far as I know, have not heretofore been brought to the attention of our Southern people.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4827"/>When we consider these facts, I think the result was truly remarkable, and something for the <rs>Northern</rs> people to think of now, when many of them so flippantly taunt the <rs>Southern</rs> people with having been <q direct="unspecified">rebels</q> and <q direct="unspecified">traitors.</q>

<p>I think these figures and these facts demonstrate that if this election had been a fair <num value="1">one</num>, without the interference of the military, a majority of the voters of the <rs>North</rs> would have said by their votes that the war then being waged against the <rs>South</rs> <hi rend="italics">was wrong</hi>, and would therefore have stopped it of their own accord, because they were <hi rend="italics">convinced</hi> it was wrong, and contrary to <q direct="unspecified">justice, humanity, liberty, and the public welfare.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>Those circumstances have been very remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>This contest has been signalized by the exhibition of some of the best and some of the worst qualities that war has ever brought out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>Ardour and devotedness of patriotism which might alone be enough to make us proud of the century to which we belong; a unanimity such as has probably never been witnessed before; a wisdom in legislation; a stainless good faith under extremely difficult circumstances; a clear appreciation of danger, coupled with a determination to face it to the uttermost; a resolute abnegation of power in favor of leaders in whom those who selected them could trust; with an equally resolute determination to reserve the liberty of criticism, and not to allow those trusted leaders to go <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one inch</measure> beyond their legal powers; a heroism in the field and behind the defences of beseiged cities, which can match anything that history has to show; a wonderful helpfulness in supplying needs and creating fresh resources; a chivalrous and romantic daring, which recalls the middle ages; a most scrupulous regard for the rights of hostile property; a tender consideration for the vanquished and the weak; a determination not to be provoked into retaliation by the most brutal injuries, which makes <num value="1">one</num> wonder, recollecting what those injuries have been, whether in their place, <num value="1">one</num> would have done as they have done. * * * And the remarkable circumstance is * * * <hi rend="italics">that all the good qualities have been on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and all the bad ones on the other</hi>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5302"/>After the <rs>Federals</rs> obtained possession of the copper-mines of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> great anxiety was excited as to the future store of copper, from which to manufacture <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion-caps</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5303"/>The casting of bronze field-guns was immediately suspended, and all available copper was carefully hoarded for the manufacture of caps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5305"/>No reliance could be placed on the supply from abroad, though large orders were forwarded, so stringent was the blockade; of course, the knowledge of this scarcity of copper was not made public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5346"/>The plan proposed was theoretically correct, and is worth mentioning, inasmuch as very late in the war the identical plan was sent to <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n0284.0026.00371.03435" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Aaron,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, as a scientific gift of great value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5347"/>This was sent by him to the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and hence found its way to the arsenal, where the drawings were regarded with interest, since they corresponded exactly with those made at the arsenal years previously.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5348"/>The idea was to fire an elongated compound projectile, made of lead and hard wood, or papier mache, with spear-point shaped head and shaft of lead &mdash; the shaft portion to be enclosed in a hollow sabot of wood or hard papier mache.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5349"/>On firing, the lighter material, moving <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, would press outwards the arrow head, and thus destroy windage, and the flight of the trajectory would be as an arrow, without rotating on the shorter axis, inasmuch as the centre of inertia of the projectile would be in advance of the centre of resistance of the air. At least that was the theory of the compound projectile, devised for the old smooth-bore musket.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5350"/>An attempt was made to use on the field round concussion shell from the howitzers as mortars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5351"/>In this concussion shell a friction primer, properly wrapped, acted as a fuse, its head terminated in a bullet, which rested on the shoulder of the brass fuse that screwed into the shell, leaving an unfilled hollow space about the bullet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5352"/>When the round shell struck any point, except that exactly in rear of the prolongation of the wire, put in the axis of the bore by using a sabot, the momentum of the bullet would draw the friction primer <pb id="p.372" n="372"/> and explode the shell, regardless of the point on which a round shell struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5353"/>A gun-carriage was made for howitzers with a jointed trail, as thus they could be used as mortars, and fired at a high angle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5354"/>These were rather experiments than instances of success, and are only mentioned now to show that the ordnance officers did something more than simply attempt to imitate the <rs>Federals</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5355"/>They were prevented from accomplishing what they planned by reason of the want of machinery to do the necessary work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5356"/>During the siege around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> it was discovered that the shells used for the large Parrot guns were very defective &mdash; that is, had but very short range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5357"/>The shells would start off and fly well and straight, revolving on the longer axis during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the trajectory, and then suddenly whirl on the shorter axis and drop almost vertically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5358"/><num value="1">One</num> can tell by the ear the instant the axis of revolution changes, if <num value="1">one</num> gun is fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5359"/>The action of the shell being observed, the cause was obvious and a remedy suggested itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5360"/>The center of the resistance of the air at the summit of the trajectory was in advance of the centre of inertia, and produced a couple that caused the rotation on the shorter axis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5361"/>The obvious remedy was to make the front of the shell hemispherical instead of conoidal, and diminish its length, and thus put the centre of gravity forward of the centre of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5362"/>With this change made, the maximum range was attained; and the complaints of the artillerist ceased.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5363"/>When we consider the absence of manufactories and machinery and of skilled mechanics in the <rs>South</rs> at the beginning of the war, its successfully furnishing ordnance supplies for so large an army, during the <num value="4">four</num> eventful years, is a striking evidence of the energy and resources and ability of its people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5364"/>The success of the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> was due to its able chief, <persName n="Gorgas,General,J.,,," id="n0284.0026.00372.03436" reg="expanded:Gorgas,Josiah,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName>, and in large measure to the intelligence and devotion of its officers, selected by the sifting process of special examinations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5365"/>I must add this, that never was an order received from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0284.0026.00372.03437" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> for ammunition that it was not immediately supplied, even to the last order to send a train-load of ammunition to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, after the order was received for the evacuation of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 19" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5366"/>As continuous work was necessary to keep a supply of ammunition at times serious difficulties threatened the arsenal, not only from scarcity of supplies of material, but also from depreciation of our currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5367"/><pb id="p.373" n="373"/></p> 
<p>Food supplies were very scarce in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 19" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and became enormously high in Confederate currency, and during the very severe last winter of the war all the female operatives who filled cartridges with powder, left the arsenal and struck for higher wages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5368"/>These were trained operatives, and the demand for ammunition was too great to afford time to train others even if they could have been secured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5369"/>An increase in money wages would not relieve the difficulty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5370"/>I remember once being, early in the morning, on the island in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, with the ice and frost everywhere, surrounded by a number of thinly-clad, shivering women, and, mounting a flour barrel, I attempted to pursuade them by appeals to their loyalty and patriotism to continue at their work until better arrangements could be made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5371"/>But patriotic appeals had no effect on shivering, starving women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5372"/>Very fortunately at this juncture a vessel with a cargo for the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> ran the blockade at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5373"/>An ordinance store was immediately established, and food and clothing sold to the employees of the arsenal at <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> the market price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5374"/>This fortunate cargo made all happy and relieved the impending difficulty.</p>
