<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>He said, <q direct="unspecified">She is my wife and she wants to see you.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>There was a mutually cordial meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>While standing in a group of old <pb id="p.30" n="30"/> friends I felt a gentle tap on my shoulder from behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>It was my dear old professor of mathematics, <persName n="Jacobs,,,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00543" reg="mostcommon:Jacobs,nomatch:0"><surname>Jacobs</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>He whispered to me in his kindest, gentlest way not to talk about the war. I deeply appreciated his kindness and solicitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>But I had not been talking about the war. The war was forgotten as I talked of the olden days.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>On another street a gentleman approached me and made himself known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It was <persName n="Swope,Reverend,David,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00544" reg="default:Swope,David,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Swope</surname></persName>, a native of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, who was of the next class below mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He manifested genuine pleasure in meeting me. He told me he was living in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> when the war broke out. He recalled a little incident of the college days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>He asked me if I remembered in passing a certain house I said to a little red-headed girl with abundant red curls, standing in front of her house, <q direct="unspecified">I'll give you a levy for <num value="1">one</num> of those curls.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>I told him that I remembered it as if it were yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>He said that little girl was now his wife; and that she would be delighted to see me. He took me to a temporary hospital where there were a large number of our wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>He had taken charge of the hospital, and manifested great interest in them and showed them every tender care and kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>I fancied that those <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> days had addled something to the sympathy of his kind, generous nature towards our wounded; and when I took leave of him, I am sure the warm grasp of my hand told him, better than my words, of the grateful feelings in my heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>I must ask indulgence to mention another incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>I met on the college campus a son of <persName n="Baugher,Professor,,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00545" reg="mostcommon:Baugher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Baugher</surname></persName>, who was then president of the college, and who was president when I graduated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The son gave me such a cordial invitation to dine with him and his father that I accepted it. They were all very courteous; but I fancied I detected a reserved dignity in old <persName n="Baugher,Doctor,,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00546" reg="mostcommon:Baugher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Baugher</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It was very natural for him to be so, and I appreciated it. The old <rs>Doctor</rs>, while kindhearted, was of a very positive and radical character, which he evinced on all subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>He was thoroughly conscientious, and was of the stuff of which martyrs are made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>He was thoroughly orthodox in his Lutheran faith; and in politics, without ever hearing a word from him, I venture to say he was in sympathy with, I will not say, <persName n="Stevens,,Thaddeus,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00547" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, but with <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00548" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> and <persName n="Phillips,,,,," id="n0292.0004.00030.00549" reg="mostcommon:Phillips,William,B.,,:1"><surname>Phillips</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>My <pb id="p.31" n="31"/> knowledge of him left me no need to be told that his views and feelings involved in the war were intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>And there he was, breaking bread with a red handed rebel in his gray uniform, giving aid and comfort to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Was he not put to it to keep mastery of himself?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Happy for man that he is double sighted; that there is within him a quality allied to conscience,&mdash;call it charity&mdash;that enables him to choose on which side to look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The venerable <rs>Doctor</rs> saw before him only his old student, recalled only the old days, and their dear memories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If there was anything between his heart and his country's laws, there was nothing between his heart and his Saviour's sweet charity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>And here I must relate an incident of those old days not wholly irrelevant and inopportune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>I graduated in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>I had the honor to be the valedictorian of my class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>In preparing my address I took notice of the great excitement then prevailing on account of the discussion in Congress of the bill to admit <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> as a State into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Great sectional feeling was aroused through this long protracted discussion in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/><num value="1">One</num> senator dared use the word <q direct="unspecified">disunion</q> with a threat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The very word sent a thrill of horror over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I recall my own feeling of horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>In my address to my classmates I alluded to this sectional feeling, deprecating it, and exclaimed, <q direct="unspecified">Who knowns, unless patriotism should triumph over sectional feeling but what we, classmates, might in some future day meet in hostile battle array.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Baugher,Doctor,,,," id="n0292.0004.00031.00550" reg="mostcommon:Baugher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Baugher</surname></persName>, as president of the college, had revision of our graduating speeches, and he struck this part out of my address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>But alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>it was a prophetic conjecture; and members of our class met in after years, not only in battle array, but on the fields over which, in teaching botany, <persName n="Jacobs,Professor,,,," id="n0292.0004.00031.00551" reg="mostcommon:Jacobs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Jacobs</surname></persName> had led us in our study of the wild flowers that adorned those fields.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Many other incidents occurred on this day deeply interesting to me, but they might not interest others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>I returned to the hospital, but not before leaving my measure and order with a tailor for a suit of gray, which was subsequently delivered to me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>It was a queer episode&mdash;a peace episode in the midst of war. This experience of mine taught me that the hates and prejudices engendered by the war were national, not individual; that individual <pb id="p.32" n="32"/> relations and feelings were but little affected in reality; and that personal contact was sufficient to restore kindliness and friendship.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>A short while afterwards I was taken from the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 12">Twelfth Corps</orgName> Hospital to <placeName key="tgn,1006924" n="1.000 11" reg="davids island, westchester, new york">David's Island</placeName>, which is in <placeName reg="Long Island Sound" key="tgn,2467766">Long Island Sound</placeName>, near and opposite to <placeName reg="New Rochelle, Westchester, New York" key="tgn,2070774">New Rochelle, in New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>A long train from <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> took a large number of Confederate wounded, not only from the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 12">Twelfth Corps</orgName> Hospital but from other hospitals, to <placeName key="tgn,2064650" n="1.000 2" reg="elizabethport, elizabeth, union">Elizabethport</placeName>, and from there the wounded were taken by boat to <placeName key="tgn,1006924" n="1.000 11" reg="davids island, westchester, new york">David's Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>We were taken by way of <placeName key="tgn,2064650" n="1.000 2" reg="elizabethport, elizabeth, union">Elizabethport</placeName> instead of by way of <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey City</placeName>, on account of a recent riot in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York City</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>All along, at every station at which the train stopped, it seemed to me, our wounded received kind attentions from leading ladies, such as <persName n="Broadhead,Mrs.,,,," id="n0292.0004.00032.00552" reg="mostcommon:Broadhead,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Broadhead</surname></persName> and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>These ladies brought them delicacies in abundance; and at <placeName key="tgn,2064650" n="1.000 2" reg="elizabethport, elizabeth, union">Elizabethport</placeName> these attentions became so conspicuous that Federal officers complained of the neglect of the <rs>Union</rs> wounded on the train, and forced the <rs>Southern</rs> sympathizers, as they called them, to distribute their delicacies between the wounded of both sides.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>When we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,1006924" n="1.000 11" reg="davids island, westchester, new york">David's Island</placeName>, we found there a firstclass hospital in every respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>They were in <pb id="p.33" n="33"/> a wretched condition&mdash;dirty, ragged, and covered with vermin&mdash; their soiled and torn uniforms, if such they may be called, were stained and soaked with blood; and their wounds, which had not been dressed from the time of the battles at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> until their arrival here, were absolutely alive with maggots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>They gave up their homes and established themselves in the kitchens attached to the pavilions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>Why? He said because he was a Democrat and opposed to the war. He was a genuine <q direct="unspecified">Copperhead,</q> and either from intolerance or other cause, he was a warm sympathizer with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>The opportunity to express his sympathy was a great relief and gratification to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Within the prison was a sutler's store from which the prisoners were allowed to buy without restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>Boxes of provisions and clothing from friends were permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>To show the liberality with which these were allowed, I received from my dear brother, <persName n="Thomas,,Julius,O.,," id="n0292.0004.00043.00651" reg="default:Thomas,Julius,O.,,"><foreName>Julius</foreName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, of <address><street n="Four Square">Four Square</street></address>, <placeName reg="Isle of Wight, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002506">Isle of Wight county</placeName>, Virginia, a box of tobacco which he had kindly sent as a gift to me, through the lines under the flag of true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It was as good to me as a bill of exchange, and I disposed of it for its money value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>This condition continued until the issuing of orders, said to be in retaliation of treatment of Federal prisoners at <placeName key="tgn,2021938;tgn,2021870" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021938;Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2021870;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Andersonville, Sumter, Georgia,Sumter,Georgia,United States,North and Central America;Acworth, Cobb, Georgia,Cobb,Georgia,United States,North and Central America">Andersonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>These orders put the prisoners on half rations, excluded the sutler's store from the prison, and prohibited the receipt of all boxes of provisions&mdash;with a discretion to the surgeon in charge <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> to allow boxes for sick prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The result of these orders was that the prisoners were kept in a state of hunger&mdash;I will say in a state of sharp hunger&mdash;all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>My messmates whom I have before mentioned, were as refined and as well bred as any gentlemen in the <rs>South</rs>; and they had been accustomed to wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>We employed a person to cook our rations, and to place them on the table in our room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Sit down and help ourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>No. We could not trust ourselves to do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>We would divide up the food into <num value="5">five</num> plates as equally as we could do it.

And when we had finished our meal, there was not left on our plates a trace of food, grease or crumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Our plates would be as clean as if wiped with a cloth; and we would arise from the table hungry&mdash;hungry still&mdash;ravenously hungry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>We no longer disdained the fat, coarse pork&mdash;the fatter, the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>It was sustenance we craved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>No longer did we crave desserts and dainties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The cold, stale bread was sweeter to us than any cake or dainty we ever eat at our mother's table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>We would at times become desperate for a full meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Then by common consent we would eat up our whole day's rations at <num value="1">one</num> meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>And then, alas, we would get up with hunger&mdash;hungry still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>My <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it was terrible!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Yet we kept in excellent health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>I said it then, and I have said it hundreds of times since, that if I had an enemy whom I wished to punish exquisitely, I would give him enough food to keep him in health with a sharp appetite, but not enough to satisfy his appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>I would keep him hungry, sharply, desperately hungry all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>It was a cruel, bitter treatment, and that, too, by a hand into which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> had poured to overflowing its most bounteous gifts.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>This is the holy Sabbath, my dear friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>Can I better interest you than by giving you a religious view of our prison?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>There are many things in prison life, if properly improved, that conduce to religious sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>A prisoner's unfortunate <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> condition, of itself, imposes upon him much seriousness, and in his long unemployed hours reflection grows upon him. There is a pensive sorrow underlying all his thoughts, and his sensibilities are ever kept sensitive by the recollection of home, and the endearments of love from which he is now indefinitely excluded, while his patriotic anxieties are constantly and painfully alive to the wavering fortunes of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>You will not therefore be surprised to learn that there is here a high moral tone and religious feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The present campaign was preceded by daily prayer meetings here, and for a long time afterwards kept up. And it would have done your heart good to have heard the earnest appeals that rose to the throne of the <name>Great Ruler</name> of Nations from every block.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>You can imagine the great burden of these earnest prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>These prayer meetings are still of almost daily occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>We have here also our Bible Classes, and also our Christian Associations, that do a great deal of good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>But above all we have our sermons on the <name>Sabbath</name> and other days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Among the officers here are a number of prisoners who are ministers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of our greatest privileges that these are allowed to preach to us unmolested, and with all freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>I can scarce ever attend <num value="1">one</num> of these services without having my eyes moistened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> subjects that never grow trite, though never passed over without allusion in these services&mdash;our country and the loved ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>These ever elicit the hearty amen, and the tender tear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>These touch the deepest and strongest chords of our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Ah! was country ever loved as it is by its far off imprisoned soldiers!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Was home and its dear ones ever loved as by him who sighs in imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The heart grows hallowed under these sacred, tender influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Shut out from the beautiful green earth we learn to look up to the sky that is above us; and through its azure depths and along the heights of its calm stars, our thoughts like our vision, rise Heavenward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>Many a <num value="1">one</num> who entered these prison bounds with a heart thoughtless of his soul's high interests, has turned to his <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and now nearly on every Sabbath there is either some <num value="1">one</num> baptized or added to some branch of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>He was the only <num value="1">one</num> of my regiment who died in the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>He was severely wounded at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, at the <rs>Bloody Angle</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>He was from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>He was a gallant, conscientious, patriotic soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>He asked only once for a furlough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>That came to him after we had started or were about to start on our <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>He declined it. It was to him as if he were taking a furlough in the presence of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>There was something pathetic in the refusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>It was to give him opportunity to meet, and see, <num value="1">one</num> whom he loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>He sacrificed to duty the heart's dearest longing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Well do I remember his burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>That open grave is even now clearly before me, as vividly as on that day. His comrades are standing around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>There is a tender pathos in the voice of the holy man, a Confederate minister, who is conducting the solemn service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>There are tears in the eyes of us all. The deep feeling was not from any words spoken but a silent welling up from our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The inspiration felt in common was from the occasion itself&mdash;the lowering down the youthful form of this patriotic soldier into the cold bosom of that bleak far off island&mdash; so far away&mdash;--so far from his home and kindred&mdash;--so far away from the <num value="1">one</num> that loved him best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Well do I remember as I stood there looking into that grave into which we had lowered him, there came to me feelings that overcame me. I seemed to identify myself with him. I put myself in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Then there came to me as it were the tender wailing grief of all who loved me most&mdash;dear ones at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Even now as I recall the scene, the feelings that then flowed, break out afresh and I am again in tears.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>By whom we were accepted and assigned to duty at <orgName type="battery" n="Battery 19">Battery No. 19</orgName>, on the turnpike, between <placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName> and the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>After being there a while, I came to the conclusion that our position was unimportant, and that we would likely be called to field duty, for which I did not think my men were well suited; hence, I went over to see <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0292.0009.00083.00846" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and suggested to him the propriety of obstructing the river, and the establishment of a fort at some selected point, and let me take my command down there for service, for which they were well suited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>To all of which he readily agreed, in view of the fact which was clearly foreshadowed that <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would soon be evacuated, and the river open to a raid upon the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital by the <rs>Federal</rs> gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>Upon reaching <placeName reg="Howlett">Howlett</placeName>'s, which is at the head of the <name>Horse</name> <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> Shoe, forming <placeName reg="Dutch Gap, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2302176">Dutch Gap</placeName>, we concluded that was the best place, both on account of its great elevation, and the more even depth of the river at that point, with an abundance of timber on either bank for the obstructions; soon, however, upon the examination of some charts of the river, which we had with us, it was seen that the <rs>Federals</rs> might cut through at the <rs type="place">Gap</rs>, and pass on up the river, and we would have to go above for our fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>Then <placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName> was found to be the next best place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>Thither I removed my command the following day, and went to work with <persName n="Mason,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0292.0009.00084.00849" reg="mostcommon:Mason,W.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, in helping to obstruct the river and throw up the fort, furnishing him details from my company, who put in the cribbing, employing my team, labor and company to aid him, which was likewise done by other members in my command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>So the work went on pretty much after the order of a private enterprise until a short while before <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> was evacuated, when the remnant of our navy made their appearance in their flight before the <rs>Federal</rs> gunboats, terribly demoralized, and surprised that we should think of resisting those heretofore victorious and invincible gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>With some persuasion they were induced to stop with us, and planted themselves on the river above our fort, with assurance that we could take proper care of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>And I believe they were all struck down while our <num value="2">two</num> guns were silent toward the end of the action, when we were ordered by <persName n="Farrand,Captain,,,," id="n0292.0009.00093.00904" reg="mostcommon:Farrand,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Farrand</surname></persName> to <q direct="unspecified">cease firing for half an hour,</q> presumably to save our ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1299"/>But we had to commence firing again long before the time expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1300"/>For the commander of the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName>, no doubt, thinking that all of our guns had been silenced, signaled to the <num value="3">three</num> wooden boats, which immediately advanced and took up a new position, right behind the <term type="ship">Monitor</term>, <rs type="ship">Galena</rs>, and all <num value="5">five</num> of them redoubled their fire on our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1301"/>And I have always thought that it was at this time all the casualties on our side took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1302"/>As we heard the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> outcry of the unfortunate wounded while we were lying down with all our guns silent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1303"/>About this time a naval officer walked down and said to me, <q direct="unspecified">we must commence to fire again, as the boats are now firing into our men.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1304"/>So without further waiting we all resumed our posts for action at the guns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1306"/>Then after both sides had exchanged a few more rounds, I saw a peculiar flag (to me) slowly creeping up the small iron mast of the <rs>Galena</rs>, so I called to the men and cried: <q direct="unspecified">Look out, they are going to try some other scheme.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1307"/>When at once, (about <num value="11">11</num>:<time value="05oclock">05 o'clock</time>), after the fight had been going on fully <num value="4">four</num> long hours, the <num value="3">three</num> wooden boats turned and began to steam rapidly down the river, followed more slowly by the <rs>Monitor</rs> and <rs>Galena</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1310"/>No other objection being raised about our thus disobeying orders, we loaded the gun as fast as we possibly could, and by the time we got it <q direct="unspecified">in battery</q> the wooden boats had gotten nearly a mile from us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1319"/>As has been said, the guns not disabled had also been made in the county.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1323"/>It was true that some of the sick ran home, and many of the unemployed were dreadfully demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1324"/>But that kind of timidity is usual among men in all commands, while receiving their baptism of fire and unable to defend themselves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1325"/>The disabling of <rs n="Gun 1">Gun No. 1</rs> (<measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure>), in charge of <orgName n="company"><persName n="Jordan,Captain,,,," id="n0292.0009.00095.00916" reg="nearbymention:Jordan,Richard,E.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Jordan</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>, has been alluded to, but I will state further that it was badly disabled at the time of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, by a too severe recoil, and for some time we thought that it had been handled awkwardly, and the mishap had been caused by its <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> having been fired <q direct="unspecified">in gear.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1326"/>But we afterward came to the conclusion that it had in <num value="2">two</num> charges of both powder and shot, as the report was very loud, indeed, as burnt grains of powder fell at our gun (the line of fire being very oblique).

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1327"/>And <persName n="Tucker,Captain,,,," id="n0292.0009.00096.00917" reg="mostcommon:Tucker,A.,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Tucker</surname></persName>'s naval gun, as before mentioned, was disabled by the rain causing its superstructure to give away so that its casemate of heavy logs caved in on it, which deprived us of their help also, until near the end of the fight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1328"/>No doubt the moral effect caused by the presence of the crew of the <rs>Merrimac</rs> was great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1329"/>But otherwise without any fault of theirs, they rendered very little help towards the repulse of the hostile fleet of gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1330"/>It was true that <persName n="Farrand,Captain,,,," id="n0292.0009.00096.00918" reg="mostcommon:Farrand,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Farrand</surname></persName>, with his professional skill, in giving very pertinent commands, rendered valuable aid.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1334"/>Perhaps, here, it would be well to state that our skill of gunnery and the effectiveness of our fire, were greatly aided by the fact that, unfortunately for us, the <rs>Monitor</rs> and <rs>Galena</rs> (the front sights of our guns being short), came within point-blank range, thus rendering themselves conspicuous targets easy to hit, so that we wasted very few shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1335"/>Our height, <measure n="90feet" type="distance">ninety feet</measure> above the water, caused the line of fire of our guns to be about <num value="3">three</num> degrees depression to reach them, while theirs on the contrary, had to be about the same degrees of elevation to reach us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1336"/>It is now useless to discuss the <q direct="unspecified">might have beens,</q> but if our <num value="2">two</num> guns had been <measure n="10inch" type="distance">ten-inch</measure> calibre instead of <measure n="8inch" type="distance">eight-inch</measure>, <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> thus making the projectiles as heavy, the <rs>Galena</rs> would have been rendered a total wreck.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1339"/>Now, as to the damage to the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1340"/>We afterwards heard that the <rs>Galena</rs> lost about <num value="40">forty</num> men&mdash;wounded and killed&mdash;and that she was badly damaged by having her armor jarred loose, and her deck ripped up by our shot, after penetrating being deflected upward by chains, anchors, &amp;c., piled on that side for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>No official subjects of importance were alluded to in that interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>At <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> the next evening, by appointment of the <rs>President</rs>, a conference was had between himself, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00129.01219" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00129.01220" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,C.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>Having but recently arrived, and not being well acquainted with the special subjects referred to, I took little or no part in this conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>Finally, with perhaps some abruptness, I said: <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is it not possible to put this army in condition to assume the active offensive?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>adding that this was a question of vital importance, upon which the success or failure of our cause might depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>This question brought on discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>The precise conversation which followed I do not propose to give; it was not an argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>There seemed to be little difference of opinion between us in regard to general views and principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>It was clearly stated and agreed to that the military force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was at the highest point it could attain without arms from abroad; that the portion of this particular army present for duty was in the finest fighting condition: that if kept inactive it must retrogade immensely in every respect during the winter, the effect of which was foreseen and dreaded by us all. The enemy were daily increasing in number, arms, discipline, and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>We looked forward to a sad state of things at the opening of a spring campaign.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>These and other points being agreed upon without argument, it was again asked: <q direct="unspecified"><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, is it not possible to increase the effective strength of this army, and put us in condition to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> and carry the war into the enemy's country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>Can you not by stripping other points to the last they will bear, and, even risking defeat at all other places, put us in condition to move forward?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>Success here at this time saves everything; defeat here loses all.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>In explanation and as an illustration of this, the unqualified opinion was advanced that if for want of adequate strength on our part in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> the <rs>Federal</rs> forces should take military possession of that whole State, and even <pb id="p.130" n="130"/> enter and occupy a portion of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, a victory gained by this army beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs> would, by threatening the heart of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, compel their armies to fall back, free <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and give us the line of the <rs>Ohio</rs> within <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> thereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>On the other hand, should our forces in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Kentucky</placeName> be strengthened, so as to enable us to take and to hold the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName> as a boundary, a disastrous defeat of this army would at once be followed by an overwhelming wave of Northern invaders, that would sweep over <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, extending to the northern part of the cotton States, if not to New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>Similar views were expressed in regard to ultimate results in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> being dependent upon the success or failure of this army, and various other special illustrations were offered, showing, in short, that success here was success everywhere, defeat here defeat everywhere; and that this was the point upon which all the available forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> should be concentrated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>It seemed to be conceded by all that our force at that time here was not sufficient for assuming the offensive beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and that even with a much larger force an attack upon their army under the guns of their fortifications on this side of the river was out of the question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> asked me what number of men were necessary, in my opinion, to warrant an offensive campaign, to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs>, cut off the communications of the enemy with their fortified capital, and carry the war into their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>In this connection there was some discussion of the difficulties to be overcome and the probabilities of success, but no <num value="1">one</num> questioned the disastrous results of remaining inactive <pb id="p.131" n="131"/> throughout the winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Notwithstanding the belief that many in the <rs>Northern</rs> army were opposed on principle to invading the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and that they would fight better in defending their own homes than in attacking ours, it was believed that the best, if not the only, plan to insure success was to concentrate our forces and attack the enemy in their own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, I think, gave no definite opinion in regard to the number of men necessary for that purpose, and I am sure that no <num value="1">one</num> present considered this a question to be finally decided by any other person than the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding general</rs> of this army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>Returning to the question that had been twice asked, the <rs>President</rs> expressed surprise and regret that the number of surplus arms here was so small, and I thought, spoke bitterly of this disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>He then stated that at that time no reinforcements could be furnished to this army of the character asked for, and that the most that could be done would be to furnish recruits to take the surplus arms in store here (say <num value="2500">2,500</num> stand); that the whole country was demanding protection at his hands and praying for arms and troops for defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>He had long been expecting arms from abroad, but had been disappointed; he still hoped to get them, but had no positive assurance that they would be received at all. The manufacture of arms in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> was as yet undeveloped to any considerable extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>Want of arms was the great difficulty; he could not take any troops from the points named, and without arms from abroad could not re-inforce this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>He expressed regret, and seemed to feel deeply, as did every <num value="1">one</num> present.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>When the <rs>President</rs> had thus clearly and positively stated his inability to put this army in the condition deemed by the generals necessary before entering upon an active offensive compaign, it was felt that it might be better to run the risk of almost certain destruction fighting upon the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs> rather than see the gradual dying out and deterioration of this army during a winter, at the end of which the term of enlistment of half the force would expire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>The prospect of a spring campaign to be commenced under such discouraging circumstances was rendered all the more gloomy by the daily increasing strength of an enemy already much superior in numbers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>On the other hand was the hope and expectation that before <pb id="p.132" n="132"/> the end of winter arms would be introduced into the country, and all were confident that we could then not only protect our own country, but successfully invade that of the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>If they did not advance, we had but to await the winter and its results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>After the main question was dropped, the <rs>President</rs> proposed that, instead of an active offensive campaign, we should attempt certain partial operations&mdash;a sudden blow against <persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n0292.0011.00132.01224" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName> or <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0292.0011.00132.01225" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, or to break the bridge over the <rs>Monocacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>This he thought, besides injuring the enemy, would exert a good influence over our troops and encourage the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>In regard to attacking <persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n0292.0011.00132.01226" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName>, it was stated in reply that, as the enemy controlled the river with their ships of war, it would be necessary for us to occupy <num value="2">two</num> points on the river, <num value="1">one</num> above and another below the point of crossing, that we might by our batteries prevent their armed vessels front interfering with the passage of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>In any case, the difficulty of crossing large bodies over wide rivers in the vicinity of an enemy, and then recrossing, made such expeditions hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1948"/>Dear Sir,&mdash;Please accept my sincere thanks for your kind letter of the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct>, and for your consideration in enclosing to me the copy of a <q direct="unspecified">paper</q> the existence of which was unknown to me, and which because of its special reference to myself I am glad to possess.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1949"/>The <q direct="unspecified">paper</q> purports to be a statement of a conversation of <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> duration, and to have been prepared from memory, <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> after the conversation occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1950"/>The occasion is represented to have been an official conference or council between myself, as the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and the <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role" reg="senior-General">senior generals</rs> of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>It is a condemnatory fact, not stated in the paper, that no notice was given to me of a purpose to make a record of the conversation, and no opportunity allowed me to make any correction of expressions attributed to me in the paper, thus secretly prepared, and so preserved until, in the <num value="19" type="ordinal">nineteenth</num> year after its date, it was revealed to me by being offered to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for publication among the documents relating to the war. It may naturally he asked why was it secretly prepared, and why now offered for publication?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Without assigning a motive, or directly answering the questions, I think, however, it can scarcely be claimed that the object was thereby to increase the military power and to promote the ultimate sucess of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>Now, having introduced this contribution to the history of the war, in the questionable shape under which it appears, I will summarily notice its prominent features.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1954"/>The paper bearing date <dateStruct value="1862-01-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="01">January</month>, <year>1862</year>,</dateStruct> appears to have been written by <persName n="Smith,General,G.,W.,," id="n0292.0011.00136.01265" reg="default:Smith,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and to have been approved by <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00136.01266" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnston,General,J.,E.,," id="n0292.0011.00136.01267" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>It does not in some important respects agree with my recollection of what occurred, and is wanting in consistency, that infallible test of truth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1956"/>The document opens with a paraphrase of a letter said to have been written to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> by <persName n="Johnston,General,J.,E.,," id="n0292.0011.00136.01268" reg="expanded:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, asking for a conference to be held at his headquarters to decide whether the army could be reinforced to the extent that the commanding general deemed necessary for an offensive campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1957"/><pb id="p.137" n="137"/> The manner in which <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00137.01269" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> on other occasions requested me to visit the army under his command was so different from that represented in this paraphrase that I wish a copy of the letter had been given, which was probably not longer than the statement made of its contents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1958"/>If the purpose was to discuss the reinforcement of his army by the transfer of troops from other commands, as the recital of the paper indicates, <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00137.01270" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> would have known that in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 11" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, where all the returns were to be found, that question could be best considered and decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1959"/>As his army was not engaged in active operations, it would seem to have been probable and proper that he should have gone to the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>, rather than have asked that <q direct="unspecified">the <rs>President</rs>, or the <rs>Secretary</rs> of the <rs>War</rs>, or some <num value="1">one</num> representing them,</q> should go to his headquarters to solve so grave a problem, not by the best attainable data, but on such speculative views as the paper exhibits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1960"/>Very little experience, or a fair amount of modesty without any experience, would prevent <num value="1">one</num> from announcing his conclusion that troops should be withdrawn from a place, or places, without knowing how many were there, what were the terms or conditions of their enlistment, and what was the necessity for their continuance in that service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1961"/>I went to the headquarters of the army, in compliance with the request of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00137.01271" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>; on the day after my arrival reviewed the troops on the plain above <placeName reg="Fairfax Courthouse">Fairfax Courthouse</placeName>; after which I proposed to <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00137.01272" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,J.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> that we should have the desired conference, and readily assented to his wish that the <num value="2">two</num> generals next in rank to himself, <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0292.0011.00137.01273" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,General,G.,W.,," id="n0292.0011.00137.01274" reg="default:Smith,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, should be present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1962"/>I was there by invitation, and the confidence I felt in those officers, and in the purpose for which the consultation was desired, is shown by the fact that I met them unattended, and did not require minutes to be kept of the proceedings, conditions which would not have existed if the use to which the meeting has been put had been anticipated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1963"/>In view of previous correspondence, the question for consideration, so far as I knew, was what course should be adopted for the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> in the immediate future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1964"/>Therefore, I made the preliminary inquiry as to the number of troops there present for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1965"/><pb id="p.138" n="138"/></p> 
<p>To my surprise and disappointment, the effective strength was stated to be but little greater than when it fought the battle of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> of the preceding <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1966"/>The frequent reinforcements which had been sent to that army in nowise prepared me for such an announcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1967"/>To my inquiry as to what force would be required for the contemplated advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, the lowest estimate made by any of them was about twice the number there present for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1968"/>How little I was prepared for such a condition of things will be realized from the fact that previous suggestions by the generals in regard to a purpose to advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> had induced me, when I went to that conference, to take with me some drawings made by the veteran soldier and engineer, <persName n="Crozet,Colonel,,,," id="n0292.0011.00138.01275" reg="mostcommon:Crozet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Crozet</surname></persName>, of the falls of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, to show the feasibility of crossing the river at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1969"/>Very little knowledge of the condition and military resources of the country must have sufficed to show that I had no power to make the demanded addition to that army without a total disregard of the safety of other threatened positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1970"/>It only remained for me to answer that I had not power to furnish such a number of troops; and unless the militia bearing their private arms should be relied on, we could not possibly fulfil such a requisition until after the receipt of the small arms, which we had early and constantly striven to procure from abroad, and had for some time expected.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1971"/>Whatever other object there may have been for intensifying the dangers of inaction, it surely could not by these conferees have been thought necessary to impress that danger specially on me, and to put their thoughts on record for after times in such connection as to give them that special application.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1972"/>My correspondence of anterior dates might have shown that I was fully aware of it, and my suggestions in the interval, certainly did not look as if it was necessary to impress m e with the advantage of the action.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1973"/>In <num value="1">one</num> part of the paper it stated that the reinforcements asked for were to be <q direct="unspecified">seasoned soldiers,</q> such as were there present, and who were said to be in the <q direct="unspecified">finest fighting condition.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1974"/>This, if such a proposition had been made, would have exposed its absurdity, as well as the loop-hole it opened for escape, by subsequently asserting that the troops furnished were <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> not up to the proposed standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1975"/>It must be remembered that this was during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of the war, into which the <rs>Confederacy</rs> entered without an army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1976"/>In another part of the paper it is stated that there was hope and expectation that, before the end of the winter, arms would be introduced into the country, and that then we could successfully invade that of the enemy; but this supply of arms, however abundant, could not furnish <q direct="unspecified">seasoned soldiers,</q> and the <num value="2">two</num> propositions are, therefore, inconsistent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1977"/>In <num value="1">one</num> place it is written that <q direct="unspecified">it was felt it might be better to run the risk of almost certain destruction fighting upon the other side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, rather than see the gradual dying out and deterioration of this army during a winter,</q> etc.; but when it was proposed to cross into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Maryland</placeName> on a steamer in our possession for a partial campaign, difficulties arose like the lion in the path of the sluggard, so that the proposition was postponed and never executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1978"/>In like manner the expedition into <persName n="Virginia,,Westtern,,," id="n0292.0011.00139.01276" reg="default:Virginia,Westtern,,,"><foreName>Westtern</foreName> <surname>Virginia</surname></persName> was projected and achieved by <persName n="Jackson,General,T.,J.,," id="n0292.0011.00139.01277" reg="expanded:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who was not of this council.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1979"/>We are not informed who it was that <q direct="unspecified"> felt</q> that stern desire and purpose dread to go forth at <q direct="unspecified">the risk of almost certain destruction,</q> but from the foregoing and other indications, including the decision of the conferees that twice the force available was necessary for the contemplated movement across the <rs>Potomac</rs>, it is to be inferred that elsewhere than among the <num value="3">three</num> generals the described feeling must have existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1980"/>It is true that to some extent, quite short of the dire extremity of <q direct="unspecified">destruction,</q> a desire to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> was expressed by other officers, who thought the risk should be taken with the means then possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1981"/>For instance, there were those who thought it feasible, by using the steamboat, then at the mouth of <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,1132269">Aquia creek</placeName>, to cross into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Maryland</placeName>, and, by a rapid movement, to perform a valuable service in that region; another example of daring and desire to use the power then available was the request, sent through <persName n="Pendleton,General,W.,N.,," id="n0292.0011.00139.01278" reg="expanded:Pendleton,William,N.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, of the artillery, by <persName n="Jackson,Brigadier-General,T.,J.,," id="n0292.0011.00139.01279" reg="expanded:Jackson,Thomas,Jonathan,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, that his brigade should be detached and permitted to cross the <rs>Potomac</rs> and attack the enemy at his capital.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1982"/>To return to the paper now under review: In <num value="1">one</num> place it is <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> written that the <rs>President</rs> stated <q direct="unspecified">at that time no reinforcements could be furnished to the army of the character asked for.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1983"/>In another place he is made to say he could not take any troops from the points named, and, <q direct="unspecified">without arms from abroad, could not reinforce that army.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1984"/>Here, again, it is clear from the answer, that the proposition had been for such reinforcements as additional arms would enable him to give, not for <q direct="unspecified"> seasoned soldiers,</q> but for such men as would be brought into service when we could supply them with arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1985"/>Those arms he expected to receive, barring the dangers of the sea, and of the enemy, which obstacles alone prevented the <q direct="unspecified">positive assurance that they would be received at all.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1986"/></p> 
<p>It was, as stated, with deep regret and bitter disappointment that I found, notwithstanding our diligent efforts to reinforce this army, before and after the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">Battle of Manassas</rs>, that its strength had but little increased; and that the arms of absentees and discharged men were represented by only <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> on hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1987"/>Again, it is seen that the question was how many arms could be had for new levies, the requisition for reinforcements being always treated as a thing dependent upon the supply of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1988"/>The forces of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> consisting of its citizens who had been mustered into service as and when arms could be obtained, during the brief period since the <rs>Provisional Government</rs> was instituted, then about <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>, what could have been more idle than to have asked for seasoned soldiers equal in number to the largest and oldest array we had, unless it would have been the <q direct="unspecified">large additional transportation and munitions of war,</q> which, it is stated, was required, if reinforcements proposed should be furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1989"/>To a long established government with a <q direct="unspecified">standing army</q> and arsenals supplied with the munitions of war, such a requisition might have been properly offered, but under the well-known condition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> it could not have been seriously made or respectfully received.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1990"/>Having noticed the improbabilities and inconsistencies of the paper, and referred to the circumstances under which it was prepared, I submit to honorable men the fact of the concealment from me in which it was kept, and leave them to judge of the motive for that <hi rend="italics">ex parte</hi> statement, and the chances for such cointelligence as needs must exist between the executive of a government <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> and the commanders of its armies to insure attainable success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1991"/>The position at <placeName reg="Fairfax Courthouse">Fairfax Courthouse</placeName>, though it would answer very well as a point from which to advance, was quite unfavorable for defense, and when I so remarked, the opinion seemed to be that to which the generals had previously arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1992"/>It therefore, only remained to consider what change of position should be made in the event of the enemy threatening soon to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1993"/>But in the meantime I hoped that something could be done by detachments from the army to effect objects less difficult than an advance against his main force, and particularly indicated the lower part of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, where a small force was said to be ravaging the country and oppressing our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1994"/>This, I thought, might be feasible by the establishment of a battery near <placeName reg="Aquia Creek, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,1132269">Aquia creek</placeName>, where the channel of the <name>Potomas</name> was said to be so narrow that our guns could prevent the use of the river by the enemy's boats; and, by employing a steamboat lying there, troops enough could be sent over some night to defeat that force, and return before any large body could be concentrated against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1995"/>The effect of the battery and of the expedition, it was hoped, would be important in relieving our friends and securing recruits from those who wished to join us.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3276"/>The Yankee prisoners were collected under a hill, and the skirmishing, mostly with artillery, continued until about dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>As my <num value="10">ten</num> men had no guns to serve, nor small arms to use as infantry, I kept them near the courthouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3291"/>We turned after surveying the scene to rejoin our men in the village, when we heard the guns of a skirmish in the direction of the <rs>Lynchburg</rs> front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>So we went together and found the gun with the <rs>Yankee</rs> company, which had been captured, and some of the cavalry that had it in charge, and I took possession of it with my <num value="10">ten</num> men and got ready to carry it into position as soon as <persName n="Alexander,General,,,," id="n0292.0027.00247.02562" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,E.,P.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Alexander</surname></persName> should tell me where to place it.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>Before we heard what the terms of surrender were, a group of us, consisting of my men, myself, <persName n="Haskell,Colonel,,,," id="n0292.0027.00247.02566" reg="mostcommon:Haskell,A.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Haskell</surname></persName>, and a number of officers, agreed together that we would not go to prison, would cut our way through the lines some way or other, but we would not surrender to be captured and carried off.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>When my men took charge of the captured <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0292.0027.00247.02567" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> gun, the men of the company were turned over to the <rs>Confederate</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost-marshal</rs>, but as soon as the surrender was over the <rs>Federal</rs> lieutenant who commanded it and many of his men returned to where I was. He was as hot as pepper about having lost his gun that morning, but he greeted me kindly, though at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he did not seem in a humor for talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>In a little while his temper improved, and when I turned the gun over to him, he had it and the caisson hitched up, put his men in charge of it and drove off. Before he left us he said he had been deceived that morning, having been told that the way was open to him. No sooner had he got in the brush than the <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName> swooped down on him and down around him, and he didn't have a chance to fire a shot before he and his gun were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>We had taken the <rs>Yankee</rs> horses for the most part, <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> that brought out the gun and caisson and swapped them off to cavalrymen or officers, whoever wanted them, and had put in their place the worn and haggard Confederate horses that they had ridden down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4619"/>This charge by the <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num> was made contrary to the order of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0292.0041.00368.04086" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and I will give you the reason why his order was not strictly obeyed&mdash;as you will remember, the <num value="8">eight</num> companies that participated in the charge, whilst made up of an exceedingly fine body of gallant men, were, with probably the exception of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> companies, composed of undrilled and undisciplined men; in other words, they might almost be termed raw recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>Whilst the brigade was laying in the edge of the pines the <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num>, a little to the left and front of the <rs type="place">Henry House</rs>, as we were facing, <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0292.0041.00368.04087" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> rode along in line and directed me to look out for the enemy's artillery and to wait until the enemy were within <num value="30">thirty</num> paces, and then to fire and charge bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>The battle was then raging to our front and right and our forces still being driven back.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>About this time, or soon thereafter, some men, dressed in red, presumably Federals, appeared in the bushes on the left flank of the regiment, and some of the men of the left company fired at <pb id="p.369" n="369"/> them, and about the same time some shots from the enemy's artillery raked through the brush just over the regiment and tore up the ground uncomfortably near the men, and the <num value="2">two</num> things together, coming about the same time, caused considerable confusion in a part of the regiment, and realizing that the most trying position that raw men, and even the best disciplined and bravest could be placed in, was to be required to remain still, doing nothing and receiving the enemy's fire without returning it, I feared the consequences, if I strictly obeyed <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0292.0041.00369.04088" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s orders; therefore it was that I gave the orders to charge, contrary to his order to wait until the enemy was within <num value="30">thirty</num> paces, the enemy being much further off at that time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>From this you will readily see how it happened that the <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num> made the charge before the other regiments made the charge as a brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>A more gallant charge is rarely made than was then made by the <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num> (though in not a very good order).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>Very soon thereafter the other regiments of the brigade made a charge and captured another battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>The pieces taken by the <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num> were situated considerably to the left (as we were facing) of the <rs type="place">Henry House</rs>, and the pieces taken by the other regiments of the brigade were somewhat in the same line, but nearer the <rs type="place">Henry House</rs> (the <rs type="place">Robinson House</rs> being still further to the right). <num value="1">One</num> of the men of the <num value="33" type="ordinal">Thirty-third</num> cut a bridle bit from a bridle of <num value="1">one</num> of the artillery horses and gave me afterwards, which I have used ever since and have flow.
