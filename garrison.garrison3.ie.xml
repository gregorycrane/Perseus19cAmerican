<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>You will see, by the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> of to-day, that I did not go to New York, and the reasons why I remained at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>I regretted to be absent from the meeting on account of the stormy aspect of things, created by the diabolism of the New York daily press; but, in consequence of the peculiar position in which I stood to the <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName>, by their unfortunate disclaimer, I deemed it very important that the action of <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> the <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American Society</orgName>, at its present anniversary, should be entirely unbiassed by anything that I might say or do; so that it might appear, beyond all cavil, that the <name>Society</name> marked out its own course, and came to its own conclusions, without any aid from me. I hear that the meetings are proceeding in a very quiet manner, and that none of the sons of Belial have rallied either to molest or make afraid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>The great question of a repeal of the <rs>Union</rs> has been boldly and earnestly discussed; but I do not know how the debate terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>To-morrow morning, all our Eastern delegates will return&mdash;about <num value="250">250</num> of whom went on in the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,2017132" n="1.000 1" reg="mohegan, new london, connecticut">Mohegan</placeName></hi>, via <placeName key="tgn,2017438" n="1.000 13" reg="stonington, new london, connecticut">Stonington</placeName>&ndash;and then all the particulars will be made known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/>I have not at any time supposed that a majority of old organizationists are prepared openly to go for repeal; for the question is <num value="1">one</num> of recent agitation, and should be carefully examined before a verdict is made up, either <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> or <hi rend="italics">con</hi>. Yet I have no doubt whatever, that, in the progress of the discussion, all who mean to be consistent, uncompromising abolitionists will ere long be found on the side of repeal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>As for the disclaimer of our New York friends, I am sorry it was made; not only as it took a false position, but as it was extorted under circumstances that seemed to indicate a lack of self-possession, and an improper dread of mobocratic violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>It was certainly an error of judgment; but how different is this from a dereliction of principle!

<p>Dear friends: After much reflection, I have come to the conclusion not to be present at the annual meeting of the <rs>Parent Society</rs> in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>The motives which induced me to forego the pleasure of being with you on that interesting and important occasion, I trust will be accurately understood and duly appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>In a recent number of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, I ventured to state (not with the intention of committing the <name>Society</name> to any definite course of action, but merely on my own responsibility), <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> that among the topics that would undoubtedly be presented for discussion at the meeting in New York, would be the subject of a repeal of the <rs>Union</rs> between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>&mdash;or, in other words, between liberty and slavery&mdash;in order that the people of the <rs>North</rs> might be induced to reflect upon their debasement, guilt, and danger in continuing in partnership with heaven-daring oppressors, and thus be led to repentance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>In behalf of the <name>Society</name>, you have deemed it both necessary and proper publicly to disclaim any such purpose; and have led the country to infer, not only that no such topic will be introduced, but that its discussion would be foreign to the object of the anti-slavery enterprise&mdash;that it does not legitimately come within the constitutional sphere of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Under these circumstances, I am most anxious that a free and unbiassed opinion should be expressed by the <name>Society</name> on this point, and that every appearance of personal anxiety on my part, as to its decision, should be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>I am determined not to allow it to be said that the <name>Society</name> was influenced by my presence and activity to reverse the position of its Executive Committee&mdash;to disclaim the disclaimer&mdash;and to occupy new and untenable ground in relation to this great question of repeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>It is for this reason that I remain at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>I think the <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName> have seriously erred in judgment, but I do not esteem them any the less, and am as ready to give them my hearty cooperation for the overthrow of slavery as at any previous period of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>A difference of opinion and an abandonment of principle are heaven-wide from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>Of the latter, I do not believe the <rs>Committee</rs> will ever be guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>I hope nothing will be done hastily, unkindly, or rashly; and that the blessings of the <name>Almighty</name> will be with you all.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1472"/>I congratulate you, and all the friends of the cause at the same time, upon your restoration to health and your ancient occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1473"/>May you live long to discharge it worthily!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>And now, upon the occasion of my restoring to you my part of your delegated authority, will you pardon me if I say a word as to what I, in common with the best friends of the paper, wish to see the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> in your hands?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>I am sure that I know you well enough to feel confident that you will pardon the bungling manner in which it is very likely I may perform the delicate and somewhat ungracious task of finding fault and giving advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1476"/>I think that you cannot doubt my interest in you and in the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, and that you cannot attribute anything I may say, however awkwardly I may express myself, to anything but an earnest wish to make you and your paper as useful as possible to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1477"/>Now, my dear friend, you must know that to the microscopic eyes of its friends, as well as to the telescopic eyes of its enemies, <hi rend="italics">the <rs>Liberator</rs> has faults</hi>. These they keep to themselves as much as they honestly may, but they are not the less sensible of them, and are all the more desirous to see them immediately abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1478"/>Luckily, they are not faults of principle&mdash;neither moral nor intellectual deficiencies&mdash;but faults the cure of which rests solely with yourself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1479"/>I hardly know how to tell you what the faults are that we find with it, lest you should think them none at all or else unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1480"/>But no matter, of that you must be the judge; we only ask you to listen to our opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1481"/>We think that the paper often bears the marks of haste and carelessness in its getting up; that the matter seems to be hastily selected and put in <hi rend="italics">higgledypiggledy</hi>, without any very apparent reason why it should be in at all, or why it should be in the place where it is. I suppose this is often caused by your selecting articles with a view to connect remarks of your own with them, which afterwards in your haste you omit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1482"/>Then we complain that each paper is not so nearly a complete work in itself as it might be made, but that things are often left at loose ends, and important matters broken off in the middle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1486"/>Then we complain that your editorials are too often wanting, or else such, from apparent haste, as those who love your fame cannot wish to see; that important topics, which you feel to be such, are too often either entirely passed over or very cursorily treated, and important moments like the present neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1490"/>We have our suspicions, too, that good friends have been disaffected by the neglect of their communications; but of this we can only speak by conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1491"/>In short, it appears to those who are your warmest friends and the staunchest supporters of the paper, that you might make the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> a more powerful and useful instrumentality than it is, powerful and useful as it is, by additional exertions on your part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1492"/>It is very unpleasant to hear invidious comparisons drawn between the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Emancipator</hi> with regard to the manner of getting it up, and to have not to deny but to excuse them&mdash;and we knowing all the time that you have all the tact and technical talent for getting up a good paper that <persName n="Leavitt,,,,," id="n0201.0003.00086.01222" reg="nearbymention:Leavitt,Joshua,,,"><surname>Leavitt</surname></persName> has, with as much more<note anchored="yes" type="margin">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1494"/>Now we know that you have talent enough and to spare to write editorials, such as no other editor can; that you have the most ample materials for the best of selections, and eminent tact and sagacity for judging what is timely; and, moreover, that you have abundance of time for doing all this, if you would but have a little <hi rend="italics">method</hi> in your madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>A week is long enough and to spare for getting up a paper if it be properly used, and all its work be not crowded into the last day. Fewer hours a day than most men of business have to give to their affairs, would do it all&mdash;provided the work were begun soon enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>It is not often that a crisis occurs that demands the editorial of an A. S. paper to be written at the last moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1497"/>Selections might be made with an eye to <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> papers ahead, and even editorials written, so as to give you opportunity to perform <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> your important duties as a lecturer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1560"/>Some were for disbanding it, as a machine costing more than it was worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1561"/>More were for removing it to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, on the ground that there was literally nobody in New York but <persName n="Gibbons,,James,S.,," id="n0201.0003.00090.01258" reg="default:Gibbons,James,S.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Gibbons</surname></persName> who either would or could act as a member of the <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>This prophecy&mdash;for it is nothing more&mdash;neglects altogether the role of the <rs>South</rs> in the settlement of the question; and it is certainly conceivable that the spread of disinterested abolitionism at the <rs>North</rs> might have induced the slaveholding States to withdraw without violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1952"/>Be this as it may, there was but <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> ways to purge the <rs>North</rs> of its complicity with slavery&mdash;either to dissolve the <rs>Union</rs> as <persName n="Garrison,Mister,,,," id="n0201.0004.00118.01591" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName> proposed, or to eradicate the pro-slavery compromises from the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1953"/>The impossibility of the latter course has been forever settled by the fact of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, which was kindled long before there was the remotest possibility of disturbing the <hi rend="italics">status quo</hi> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1955"/>Substituting hindsight for foresight, we can now see that there was, in the very nature of the <rs>Government</rs>, an irrepressible conflict, tending to produce either rupture or a homogeneous public sentiment with regard to slavery, whether for or against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>But these have been greatly, if not entirely, removed by a perusal of this Memoir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/>I see him now in a new phase&mdash;in a better light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4065"/>He certainly had no ardor of soul, but a mild and steady warmth of character appears to have been natural to him. I do not now think that he was timid, in a condemnatory sense; but his circumspection was almost excessive, his veneration large, and distrust of himself, rather than a fear of others, led him to appear to shrink from an uncompromising application of the principles he cherished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4066"/>In the theological arena he exhibited more courage than elsewhere; yet, even there, he was far from being boldly aggressive, for controversy was not to his taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4067"/>In striving to be catholic and magnanimous, he was led to apologize for those who deserved severe condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4068"/>He was ever reluctant to believe that men sin wilfully, and, therefore, preferred to attack sin in the abstract than to deal with it personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>He was ready to condemn the fruit, but not the tree; for, by a strange moral discrimination, he could separate the <num value="1">one</num> from the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4070"/>Hence, his testimonies<note anchored="yes" type="margin">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4071"/><hi rend="italics">Ante, <num value="2">2</num></hi>.<num value="222">222</num>.</note> were not very effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4072"/>In the abstract, the vilest of men are willing to admit that their conduct is reprehensible; but, practically, they demand exemption from condemnation.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4073"/>In a pioneering sense, <persName n="Channing,Doctor,,,," id="n0201.0008.00239.03287" reg="nearbymention:Channing,William,Henry,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Channing</surname></persName> was not a reformer; sympathetically, and through a conscientious conviction, he was. If he had lived in the days of the prophets or the apostles, he would have deplored their excessive zeal, their denunciatory spirit, their indiscriminate condemnation, their rash procedure, their lack of charity and gentleness; yet he would have had no hand in their persecution, but would have commended them as<note anchored="yes" type="margin">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/><hi rend="italics">Ante, <num value="2">2</num></hi>.<num value="205">205</num>.</note> actuated by a sincere purpose, and as having a righteous object in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/>He would have felt that the priests and rulers who were subjected to their terrible rebukes were dealt with far too roughly; and this would have moved him to say a word in their favor, in order to mitigate the severity of the punishment; yet he would have confessed, and wept over, the prevalent guilt in the land, and acknowledged that both priest and ruler were largely to blame for it. This, it seems to me, was a serious defect in his character, and greatly impaired his moral usefulness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>For example&mdash;he saw with great clearness, and deplored with much sincerity, the horrors of slavery and the injustice of slaveholding; but he did not like to hear slaveholders denounced, <pb id="p.240" n="240"/> and regarded many of them as worthy of <name>Christian</name> recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4077"/>He was for drawing out leviathan with a cord, or ensnaring him as a bird&mdash;forgetting that the monster regards iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>No <num value="1">one</num> ever seemed to be more deeply convinced of the iniquitous and desolating nature of war than himself; he was fervent in his pleas for peace; yet he held to the right of fighting in what is falsely called self-defence, and therefore failed to lay the axe at the root of the tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/>It was so in his treatment of all other popular sins and sinners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>He either lacked true moral discrimination, or stern integrity to principle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>I believe he was a sincere man, and true to his own convictions of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4082"/>I think, as far as he saw the light, he was disposed to walk in the light, however great the peril or startling the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4083"/>He had in an eminent degree selfrespect, which kept him from self-degradation by wilfully doing that which he knew to be wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4084"/>His Memoir impresses me with a deep sense of his purity and uprightness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4085"/>If he had given himself to any specific reform, without compromise, as a lecturing agent, or in any other way that would have brought him in daily contact with the people of the land, I think his moral vision would have been purged, and his judgment of men and things rectified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4086"/>In such a conflict, he had no practical experience whatever; and, without that experience, he was not qualified to sit in judgment on the language and measures of those who were valiantly contending for the right against a host of evil-doers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4087"/>He was studious, contemplative, closetbounded; it was impossible, therefore, for him to be in the stern battle of life, or to perceive in what quarter the assault was to be most vigorously made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4088"/>Yet it is equally interesting and cheering, in reading his Memoir, to perceive his growing interest in reform and reformers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4089"/>His voice of rebuke to a guilty nation was growing stronger, and his <quote>all hail</quote> to the true-hearted more emphatic, continually.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4090"/>We must judge him by the position that he occupied; we must compare him with others who moved in the same sphere of life; otherwise, we shall be liable to undervalue his merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4091"/>He was a clergyman&mdash;an office which it is scarcely possible for any man to fill without loss of independence, or spiritual detriment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4092"/>In his case, it seems to have been merely technical, though he might have made it subservient to personal ambition and selfishness, as <num value="1000">thousands</num> of others have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4093"/>That he did not do so, is something to his credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>These we have had, in great variety, and they have helped to mitigate our sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>That sorrow, however, was not caused so much by the mere fact of his removal as by other considerations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>Death itself to me is not terrible, is not repulsive, is not to be deplored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4474"/>I see in it as clear an evidence of Divine wisdom and beneficence as I do in the birth of a child, in the works of creation, in all the arrangements and operations of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4475"/>I neither fear nor regret its power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4476"/>I neither expect nor supplicate to be exempted from its legitimate action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4477"/>It is not <pb id="p.264" n="264"/> to be chronicled among calamities; it is not to be styled <q direct="unspecified">a mysterious dispensation of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name></q>; it is scarcely rational to talk of being resigned to it. For what is more natural &mdash;what more universal&mdash;what more impartial&mdash;what more serviceable&mdash;what more desirable, in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> own time, hastened neither by our ignorance nor folly?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4478"/>Discarding, as I do, as equally absurd and monstrous, the theological dogma, that death settles forever the condition of those who die, whether for an eternity of bliss or misery for the deeds done here in the body &mdash;and believing, as I do, without doubt or wavering, in the everlasting progression of the human race, in the ultimate triumph of infinite love over finite error and sinfulness, in the fatherly care and boundless goodness of that Creator <q direct="unspecified">whose tender mercies are over all the works of his hands</q>&mdash;I see nothing strange, appalling, or even sad in death.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4479"/>When, therefore, my dear friend, I tell you that the loss of my dear boy has overwhelmed me with sadness, has affected my peace by day and my repose by night, has been a staggering blow, from the shock of which I find it very difficult to recover, you will not understand me as referring to anything pertaining to another state of existence, or as gloomily affected by a change inevitable to all: far from it. Where the cherished <num value="1">one</num> who has been snatched from us is, what is his situation, or what his employment, I know not, of course; and it gives me no anxiety whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4480"/>Until I join him at least, my responsibility to him as his guardian and protector has ceased; he does not need my aid, he cannot be benefited by my counsel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4481"/>That he will still be kindly cared for by Him who numbers the very hairs of our heads, and without whose notice a sparrow cannot fall to the ground; that he is still living, having thrown aside his mortal drapery, and occupying a higher sphere of existence&mdash;I do not entertain a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4482"/>My grief arises mainly from the conviction that his death was premature; that he was actually defrauded of his life through unskilful treatment; that he might have been saved, if we had not been most unfortunately situated at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4519"/>You are troubled where you ought to be serene; you are alarmed at what ought to make your repose perfect; you are not acting naturally; you occupy, in regard to these things, a sandy foundation; and therefore your anxiety, trepidation, grief!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4520"/>Come now, let us reason together, and see if it be not so. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4521"/>You do not dislike to see both sides of the slavery question presented; and you would smile at the idea of secreting the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> because it contains many pro-slavery articles which might injuriously affect some minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4522"/>You are not troubled on seeing both sides of the peace or non-resistance question argued in its columns, but rejoice in proportion to the activity of its discussion&mdash;do you not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4523"/>You are not alarmed when you see articles freely admitted, pro and <hi rend="italics">con</hi>, into a publication on the subject of temperance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4524"/>Neither you nor <persName n="Vincent,,Henry,,," id="n0201.0009.00266.03563" reg="default:Vincent,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Vincent</surname></persName> would think of remonstrating against the free utterance of sentiments in favor of religious intolerance, provided no gag were put into the mouths of the advocate of religious liberty. . . . <pb id="p.267" n="267"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4525"/>But why are you willing that these things should be freely discussed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4526"/>Simply because you are persuaded that your views of anti-slavery, peace, temperance, religious liberty, etc., are based on a solid foundation, and cannot be successfully overthrown; nay, the more they are attacked, the more truthful you think they will appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4527"/>Just so!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4528"/>Hence you invite, solicit, demand, the most thorough inquiry into their validity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4529"/>But the slaveholder, the warrior, the rum-drinker, the bigot, do not like to see their views on slavery, war, temperance, and religious liberty brought into the arena of free debate; they are <num value="1">one</num>-sided, and dread nothing so much as <quote>a fair field and no quarter.</quote> . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4530"/>Now what is true with regard to <num value="1">one</num> subject or question, is equally true in regard to every other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4531"/>Whoever holds to an opinion or sentiment which he is not pleased to see dealt with boldly and searchingly, gives evidence that he is conscious that it will not bear such treatment, or that he has taken it upon trust, usage, parental, educational, traditional authority, and not upon his own clear-wrought, unbiased convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4532"/>Is it not so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4533"/>Who shall presume to say to another, in regard to the examination of any creed, book, ordinance, day, or form of government&mdash;of anything natural or reputedly miraculous&mdash; <quote>Thus far shalt thou go, but no farther</quote> ? Beloved friend, are you not in just this state of mind, in regard to certain subjects the discussion of which you so much deplore?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4534"/>How is this to be accounted for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4535"/>I will tell you.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4536"/>You were born a member of the <orgName n="Friends Society" type="society">Society of Friends</orgName>; your religious opinions you received upon authority, and you accepted them as a matter of course, sincerely and trustingly, as I did mine, and as <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of those who are born in Christendom do. Your theological views of man's depravity, the atonement, eternal punishment, the divinity of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0201.0009.00267.03564" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:3"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, the inspiration of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, etc., you received as confidingly as you did your <placeName reg="Quaker, Wayne, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119674">Quaker</placeName> views of peace, anti-slavery, temperance, etc.,&mdash;only, the latter you have advocated and carried out to an extent much beyond the ordinary teachings of Quakerism on these points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4537"/>But the latter views are true, and susceptible of the clearest demonstration; and their examination you court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4538"/>The former are all wrong (in my judgment, I mean, though I was brought up to believe them), admit of no satisfactory proof, much less of demonstration; and a free examination of them gives you positive uneasiness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4539"/>Your peace and anti-slavery views commend themselves to your understanding, your conscience, and <pb id="p.268" n="268"/> your heart; perhaps you will discover that your theological views have really little to do with your understanding, your conscience, or your heart, independently and absolutely, like the others&mdash;pardon my frankness&mdash;for if they had, it seems to me you would no more be startled to see an impartial discussion of them in the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, or any other periodical conducted on the same principle, than you now are to see pro-slavery and antipeace sentiments admitted into its columns along with those of an opposite spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4540"/>Is there any flaw in this reasoning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4541"/>Is there any link in this chain of logic unsound?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4542"/>Is not the parallel perfect, the analogy exact, the illustration pertinent, the conclusion inevitable?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4543"/>What is it that induces you to hide the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> from your friends?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4544"/>It cannot be that you have ever seen anything in it, from my pen, detrimental to the peace, liberty, or happiness of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4545"/>Is not its standard of rectitude exalted, unswerving, absolute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4546"/>Is it not boldly and continually rebuking sin and sinners in high places and in low places?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4547"/>Is it not hated, feared, and persecuted by all that is pharisaical, intolerant, cowardly, time-serving, brutal, and devilish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4548"/>Does it not advocate, in practical life, love to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and love to man&mdash;peace on earth&mdash; the brotherhood of all mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4549"/>Is it not straining every nerve to overthrow, by sublime moral instrumentalities, that horrible system in this country by which <num value="1000000">millions</num> of our brethren and sisters are reduced to the condition of things?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4550"/>Is such a paper to be secreted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4551"/>Is its circulation to be a cause of disquietude to any pure mind, to any free spirit, to any philanthropic heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4552"/>I have never allowed a single number of it to go forth to the world without feeling that it would do something to redeem that world from sin and error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>My mistakes and infirmities have been numerous, undoubtedly&mdash;for who is infallible?&mdash;but the moral tone of my paper, I am confident, has been uniformly pure and elevated. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>My worthy friend at&mdash;&mdash;comes right to the point in her letter, of which the following is the introductory paragraph: <quote> My dear sir, I am sorry to say that I cannot read the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> any longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>You will, therefore, not send any more papers to my address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>Ever since the <name>Sabbath</name> and Scripture questions were brought forward, I have read it only to <hi rend="italics">mourn over it. I</hi> know the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and the <name>Author</name> of it so well (?) that I have not any fears for my own sentiments being injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>But I cannot put it into the hands of my family, because I consider its sentiments on these points calculated to bring forth the grapes of <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName></hi> and the apples of <hi rend="italics">Gomorrah</hi>.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/><pb id="p.269" n="269"/></p> 
<p>Is this good woman as careful to suppress in her family those political or religious periodicals which sanction war, the army and navy, a monarchical government, conquests in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and the like&mdash;all which serve to degrade, oppress, or depopulate the human race? . . . <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid that I should ever take such a responsibility upon myself&mdash;that I should ever bring my children up in this <num value="1">one</num>-sided manner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/>The <num value="1">one</num> distinct and emphatic lesson which I shall teach them is, to take nothing upon mere authority&mdash;to dare to differ in opinion from their father, and from all the world &mdash; to understand, as clearly as possible, what can be said against or in favor of any doctrine or practice, and then to accept or reject it according to their own convictions of duty. . . .</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>I doubt not that a sincere concern for the welfare of the anti-slavery cause, and the usefulness of the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> as its advocate, may give rise to the inquiry in your mind: Why discuss the merits of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, or the question of the holiness of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the week, in the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>? Is it not needlessly to deter persons from taking the paper who otherwise would be disposed to subscribe for it, being desirous to promote the abolition of slavery?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>My dear friend, it would give me great satisfaction to extend the subscription-list of my paper much beyond what it is at present; and most solicitous am I to see every slave free, and to join in singing the song of jubilee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>But I beg you and my other <name>English</name> friends to bear constantly in your minds the fact, that the discussion of these questions has been forced upon us by the enemies of the anti-slavery and non-resistance movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>Their constant cry has been, that we are desecrating the <name>Sabbath</name> in pleading the cause of the slave on that day, and mixing up secular with holy affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>Thus criminated, we have naturally been led to see how this doctrine of the holiness of days affects every reformatory enterprise, and to inquire into its origin and nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>We are enlightened as we proceed in our investigations, and led to perceive not only that there is no scriptural authority for the observance of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the week as the <name>Sabbath</name>, but that time is sanctified only as we use it aright, without regard to particular days or seasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4566"/>In short, that holiness pertains to the spirit and to its acts, not to any external arrangements or observances; and that whatever it is right to do on <num value="1">one</num> day, it is right to do on every other day of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4567"/>That this discussion has already proved highly serviceable to our cause, we have the clearest evidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4568"/>Again, in advocating our non-resistance doctrines, our opponents have resorted to the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, and thought to silence us <pb id="p.270" n="270"/> by triumphantly referring to the exterminating wars recorded in the Old Testament as expressly commanded by Jehovah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4569"/>It was not conclusive for us to reply, that what was obligatory once is not necessarily so now&mdash;that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0201.0009.00270.03565" reg="mostcommon:Christ,Jesus,,,:3"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> has superseded <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0201.0009.00270.03566" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, and now forbids all war; for the answer was: If, as you assert, war is, like slavery, idolatry, and the like, inherently wrong, a <hi rend="italics">malum in se</hi>, how could it be enjoined by a sin-hating <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in the days of <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n0201.0009.00270.03567" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, unless his moral character is mutable?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>Our answer to this is: Whoever or whatever asserts that the <name>Creator</name> has required, and may still require, <num value="1">one</num> portion of his children to butcher another portion, for any purpose whatever, is libelling his goodness, and asserting what everything in nature contradicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>This position we believe to be impregnable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4572"/>So, too, the controversies with the <orgName n="American Church" type="church">American church</orgName> and clergy have all been forced upon us by those who love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4573"/>We are not the aggressors in any of these instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4574"/>Ought we to have abandoned our ground, and avoided the conflict?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4575"/>What would have been gained by it, either to the cause of the slave in particular, or of mankind universally?</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5946"/>I believe that he is beginning to dream of this, and that it was some obscure dream of this sort that suggested the quotation from <q direct="unspecified">Hamlet.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5947"/>I do not know what else he could mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5948"/>He does not yet know that it is American Slavery which controls American policy, that it is the commanding principle of the administration of our Government, at home and abroad.

It has meddled with him already most insultingly, and, when he sees that fact, it will absolve him from all his promises not to meddle with <hi rend="italics">it</hi>. You will perceive that the view of his position which I suggest casts no reflection upon his sagacity, for it is past the philosophy of the wisest to dream of such a thing on earth as a republic like this cherishing slavery, building its freedom on the crushed rights of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and prepared to intervene in the affairs of other nations only when the slavery which it cherishes can be advantaged thereby.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6387"/>The prejudice which used to exist against him, excited by the fact that he was the earliest and always the ablest assailant of the slave system, is passing entirely away, so that now there is not <num value="1">one</num> in our ranks who enjoys more largely, or even so largely, the respect of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6827"/>I notice also a very eloquent passage on the uses and influence of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6828"/>He considers it to embody absolute and perfect religion, and that no better mode for securing present and eternal happiness can be found than the obedience to certain religious precepts therein recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6831"/>My objection to the mode in which these matters are handled in the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi> is, that the general tone and spirit seems to me the reverse of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6832"/>In place of calm, serious inquiry, I see hasty assertions, appeals to passion and prejudice, and a very general absence of proof of many of the things stated.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7346"/>Happy am I, if, in any manner, I have been of any service to you during our long and endearing acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7347"/>But you had nothing to learn of me in regard to the sacred rights of conscience, the freedom of the mind, and the duty of standing by the right at all hazards, whether solitary or backed up by a multitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7348"/>These things I found to be a part of your own nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7349"/>Moreover, it was your good fortune to throw off, at a much earlier period in life than I did, the fetters of that terrible <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> theology which has so long held mastery over the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> mind, making <num value="1">one</num> universal blight of human existence here below, and filling a future state of existence with inconceivable dangers and unutterable horrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7350"/>The Fatherhood of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was a doctrine early accepted by you, and at a time when it required the greatest moral courage to do so. Happily, you have lived to see it grow and extend in every direction; and of its ultimate acceptance by the whole human family you and I have no reason to doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7351"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> shall be all, and in all; which is saying, in other words, that nothing but goodness is immutable, all-conquering, everlasting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7352"/>I dwell, dear friend, with inexpressible satisfaction upon the fact, that your last public act in the service of the slave was that of presiding at the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> anniversary of the memorable mobocratic <dateStruct value="1835-10-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7370"/>The delight I feel in the anticipation of seeing you, face to face, in due season, is inexpressible; it will be almost like a resurrection from the dead, or a return from a higher plane of spiritual existence, so far as your bodily presence is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7371"/>From a particular standpoint, it seems a whole age since you left us. <measure n="7years" type="date">Seven years</measure> is, indeed, a long period to have been absent, considering the brevity of life; but, in the activity and tumult of a desperate campaign, where no time is left for leisure, meditation, or retirement, they seem reduced to a single point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7694"/>It is true, sir, with me, the subject is familiar; nevertheless, this is no ordinary gathering, and nothing should be hastily uttered on a question so vast, so solemn, and so revolutionary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7695"/>Sir, I do not marvel at the general hesitancy which I find in the community to come up to the high position of demanding a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7696"/>I remember how men are born, and how they are bred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7697"/>I know, in regard to my own case, with what tenacity I clung to this Union, inspired by the patriotic <pb id="p.453" n="453"/> feelings of my early days, and never dreaming that anything would ever separate me from it, or lead me to desire its dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7698"/>Men do not change the institutions which have come down to them from the past lightly, or for transient reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7699"/>They must be placed in a trying emergency,&mdash;they must feel a strong moral obligation pressing upon them,&mdash;they must clearly perceive some great impending evil to be shunned, some great good to be gained,&mdash;before they will go into revolution; whether it be a physical revolution, attended with the shedding of human blood, or a moral revolution, attended with the loss of friends and popularity, and the sacrifice of worldly interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7700"/>If the great mass of the people were ready to respond at once in favor of the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, with no more light on the subject than they now enjoy, I would give little or nothing for the response, because I should be certain it was but the mere impulse of the moment; but when they hesitate, and hold back, and forbear to the last, trusting that there may be some way of escape; when they beg for a little longer time to look at a question involving such momentous consequences, before openly committing themselves, I say: <quote>Well, that is all right and proper&mdash;it is human nature.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7701"/>When such men move, it is with the force of the thunderbolt; they are as reliable as the everlasting hills.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7702"/>If, therefore, Disunion be a matter of slow growth&mdash;as it is&mdash;I am sure it is a true growth, and that everything is gained thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7703"/>I expect it will go on, slowly gathering to itself friends and advocates, until at last it shall culminate in an all-pervading Northern sentiment, and the great work be easily accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7704"/>Our Revolutionary fathers hesitated long before they threw off the yoke of the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7705"/>How many years did they hope, and pray, and struggle for redress of their wrongs, trusting to the justice of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>&mdash;that Parliament would give heed to their petitions, and that they might be spared the necessity of raising the banner of independence&mdash;all the while avowing their loyalty to the <rs>British</rs> throne!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7706"/>Yet the hour came when, in spite of their veneration for the past, in spite of their feebleness in regard to numbers and resources, and in spite of the colossal power of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, they said, We will submit no longer!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7707"/>The time has come for us to throw off the yoke, and declare ourselves free and independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7708"/>The men who, after that time, through cowardice or selfishness, sided with the mother country, were justly branded as Tories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7709"/>Sir, the race of Tories did not die off with the <name>Revolutionary</name> <pb id="p.454" n="454"/> struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7710"/>In our day, we are passing through the same ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7711"/>We are engaged in a revolution more far-reaching, more sublime, more glorious than our fathers ever dreamed of. I know that there are honest men yet struggling with conscientious doubts, who sincerely ask, <quote>Has the time for separation come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7716"/>The air is filled with objections to a movement of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7718"/><num value="1">One</num> of these is of a very singular nature, and it is gravely urged as conclusive against Disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7720"/>Men who have never been heard of in the anti-slavery ranks, or who are ever submitting to a compromise of principle, have their bowels wonderfully moved all at once with sympathy for the suffering slave!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7723"/>Now, we who are engaged in this movement claim to be equally concerned for the liberation of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7724"/>If we have not yet proved our willingness to suffer the loss of all things, rather than to turn and flee, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> knows that we are prepared to bear any new cross that He, in his providence, may be disposed to lay upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7725"/>Now, all I have to say is, that this is a man of straw!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7726"/>I have no idea of forsaking the slave, under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7727"/>The slaveholder knows it, and the country knows it; and I am sure that those who are associated in this movement intend to continue the conflict till every yoke is broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7728"/>I declare that this talk of leaving the slave to his fate is not a true representation <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> of the case; and it indicates a strange dulness of comprehension with regard to our position and purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7729"/>What! is it to forsake the slave when I cease to be the aider and abettor of his master?
