<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>in presenting this sketch of the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> troops in the <name>Civil</name> war, the author feels that, in justice to himself and to the heroic soldiers whose deeds it attempts to commemorate, some facts in connection with its preparation should be stated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>The authorship of this chapter was originally assigned to a distinguished participant in the deeds recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>He, however, after vainly striving for about a year to find time in which to write the sketch, was reluctantly forced by his engagements to relinquish the undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Thereupon the author was invited to prepare the chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>The time which the publishers could then allow for the collection of material and the completion of the manuscript necessitated more rapid work than such a subject merits.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>This necessity for haste especially prevented the collection of much-needed data about the last <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> of the war. During those months the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers wrote very few official reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The only way, therefore, to get reasonably full information concerning the events of that period is by correspondence with the survivors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>This was attempted, but the time was too short for satisfactory results.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The author regrets exceedingly that many gallant deeds and minor actions are shut out by space limitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>He can only hope that the publication of this imperfect sketch may incite other pens to more elaborate works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>As a subsequent edition of this work may be published, the author asks for the correction of any errors unwittingly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>This step meant war, and no people were ever less prepared for an appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Hence, for manufactured articles, from linchpins to locomotives, from joint-stools to cotton-gins, the <rs>State</rs> was dependent on <name>Northern</name> and <name>English</name> markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>According to the census of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, there were only <num value="3689">3,689</num> manufacturing establishments of all kinds in its borders, and most of these employed few laborers.
