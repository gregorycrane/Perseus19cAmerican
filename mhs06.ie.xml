<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>The business was of steady growth from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and reached its climax in the decade from <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>, in which <num value="185">one hundred and eighty-five</num> vessels were constructed.

<p>Though the launchings in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> did not excite the world as did that of the <name>German</name> emperor's <term type="ship">yacht</term>, <rs type="ship">Meteor</rs>, they were nevertheless occasions of much interest, and never failed to draw many spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>They sometimes occurred at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, especially in summer, when the tallow on the ways was in danger of being melted under a meridian sun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The ships were usually built by contract, but the builders often made sub-contracts with individuals or clubs to do certain parts of the work, and those subcon-tractors, by very earnest work and sometimes even prolonging the customary <num value="10">ten</num>-hour day, usually made their jobs very profitable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>To construct the patterns for the ribs in the ship's <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> frame required much skill, and, at the time of which we write, <persName n="Stetson,,Elisha,,," id="n0334.0003.00043.00302" reg="default:Stetson,Elisha,,,"><foreName>Elisha</foreName> <surname>Stetson</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="James Ford">James Ford</placeName> had the monopoly of making them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>Ships, especially the larger ones, were usually launched when the moon was new or full, and consequently near the noon or midnight hour, as the tide was then the highest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>To make the launching easy they were built on an inclined plane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>In their construction the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act was to lay the keel, a very large, well-smoothed hard wood timber (rock maple being the favorite) extending from stem to stern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>It was supported by blocks placed a few feet apart, and on it the vessel was to rest till finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>As the work progressed, shores were placed along the ship's sides to prevent it from careening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The end nearest the water was usually the stern, but sometimes the prow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>When it was ready for the launch, ways were laid on each side at a distance, according to the vessel's size, of <num value="5">five</num> to <measure n="7feet" type="distance">seven feet</measure> from the keel, and extended down to the low water mark in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>These, about <num value="18">eighteen</num> or <measure n="20inches" type="distance">twenty inches</measure> wide, were made of long and strong timbers, and had in the centre a securely fastened strip of wood a few inches in height and width which served as a flange to keep the moving vessel on the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>After these had been given a heavy coating of tallow, sometimes a sprinkling of flaxseed, but oftener a film of <rs n="castile soap" type="product">castile soap</rs>, in addition, heavy timbers, called bilgeways, with a groove on the under side to fit the projection on the ways, were drawn up under the ship, and, by blocking, made to fit well its bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>A multitude of wooden wedges were then driven between the ship and the underlying timbers, in order to equalize the bearing upon the ways and remove some of the pressure from the blocks under the keel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Then, the before-named shores having been removed, the final act consisted in splitting to pieces with mauls and iron wedges (as the only means of removing) the blocks under the keel, commencing with those nearest the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>When all these or sometimes all but <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> were demolished <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> the ship would begin to move, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as slow as the hour hand of a clock, but faster and faster till the final dive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The construction of a ship's frame required an immense amount of timber, enough, it was said, to fill another ship of the same size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>An oak log too crooked to be worked into it could hardly be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>Almost the only square or straight timbers used were the keel which lay beneath the ribs and the keelson which lay inside the ship and above the keel to which it was firmly bolted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>A rib usually consisted of <num value="6">six</num> pieces firmly bolted together, and its shape depended upon the place it was to occupy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>Sometimes the timbers were hewn in the forest where the trees were felled, but usually the hewing was done in the yard where the ship was being built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>In this process the cubical contents of the logs were greatly diminished (in some cases by more than <num value="0.5">one half</num>), and as in the cutting of diamonds, a large percentage of the gems takes the form of chips and dust, which still have a value, so the fragments of the hewn timbers, which thus became abundant, were distributed through the town to purchasers who paid for them, according to the amount of solid wood, at the rate of <measure n="1.75dollars" type="currency">$1.75</measure> to <measure n="2.25dollars" type="currency">$2.25</measure> per load of nearly half a cord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The workmen in the shipyards usually numbered about <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num>, and sometimes more.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>The taking of shad and alewives for a brief period in spring had long been a profitable industry, and though its value had greatly diminished before <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, yet in that year <measure n="253dollars" type="currency">$253</measure> were paid to the town for the privilege of capturing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>On certain days in the week nets were stretched across the river at convenient places, and on being drawn to the shore, would often contain a cartload or more of the treasure.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Added to his gifts and attainments were his pleasing social quality, a commanding presence, and his oratorical power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>He was a fine natural reader of Scripture and hymns, which gave to his pulpit services unusual attractiveness and dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>His preparation of sermons was made with most conscientious care, writing in full the <num value="2">two</num> discourses for morning and afternoon, writing also and committing <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> to memory the prayers as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>It was a congregation of cultured people accustomed to a high order of preaching, and they found satisfaction and delight in his ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>I have read nearly all of his printed sermons, about <num value="20">twenty</num> in all, and they are marked by a pure literary style, careful in statement, earnest in feeling and rich in literary and historical illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>They fall into <num value="2">two</num> classes, though not infrequently the <num value="2">two</num> classes appear in the same discourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/><num value="1">One</num> class is that of sermons of elevated sentiment touching personal conduct and character, deeply religious in their tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>The other, that of sermons strictly if not severely logical, intended to convince the understanding of those who heard them and persuade them to action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>It is in these discourses that the trained lawyer is evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>Steps in the argument which the preacher would usually take for granted are made with the utmost care, as if he were appealing to a jury for a judgment, and for a judgment that will affect themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>This method is most clearly seen in <num value="2">two</num> discourses on <q direct="unspecified">The Moral Rule of Political Action,</q> the purpose of which was to apply this rule to the question of slavery and convince his hearers that the higher law of morals, which was the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, was the <num value="1">one</num> they must obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>I cannot speak precisely as to dates, but from <num value="12">twelve</num> to <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> of <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00082.00805" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName>'s ministry passed not <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> alone with satisfaction to his people, but with their high appreciation of him and pride in him. Then a change took place on the part of some of them, due especially to his preaching on such agitating subjects as temperance and slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>The sermons which were the cause of this division of feeling are not to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>Those I have spoken of are of a later date when the controversy was well under way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/></p> 
<p>Here was the beginning of a controversy that was <pb id="p.84" n="84"/> <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> in reaching its culmination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>It must be briefly told in this paper, though the reading of a thick volume of <num value="600">six hundred</num> pages has been necessary to the understanding of it. But a little explanation is required to set the matter fairly before us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, as to <orgName n="Hollis Street Church" type="church">Hollis Street Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>It was a church owned and controlled in law, not by the body of worshippers who rented pews in it, but by the proprietors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>The proprietors were the owners of pews, who were legally responsible for the expenses of the church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>Those who rented pews from the proprietors had no legal voice in the conduct of the parish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>If their opinion was asked on any matter, such as the choice of a minister, it had no binding force, it was only desired so that the proprietors might form a judgment as to the course it was wise to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>In this whole controversy, therefore, it is not the congregation that is concerned, it is the pew-owners or proprietors as the legally responsible party.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>It is further necessary to the understanding of <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00084.00807" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName>'s legal rights as minister to remember that he was settled under the old Congregational regime as a life-settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>The proprietors could not dismiss him at will, they could only dismiss him by his consent <hi rend="italics">unless</hi> for cause the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> should remove him, or an ecclesiastical council of churches, regularly and legally called, should vote to dissolve the connection between him and his parish, then the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> could give their decision legal force and bring his ministry to an end. This is the legal aspect or status of this controversy which will appear in what follows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>An end of the matter could have been made at once by the resignation of the pastor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>But there were good and sufficient reasons why he could not take this course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all, a vital principle was involved, that of the freedom of the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>If a minister was to be put down because of his preaching upon questions of pressing moral interest, and this by a minority whose business was affected by such preaching, then the minister had <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> ceased to be a teacher of truth and righteousness and had become a hireling to do the bidding of his supporters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/>The church would have the contempt of all right-minded men if such a view of the ministry could be held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>It was a question of deep significance not only to this special church, but to the cause of religion as well, and in taking his stand against such proscription, <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00085.00808" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName> was doing more than to defend his personal rights; he was defending the integrity of the pulpit; he was defending the cause of pure religion to a rightful place as a moral force in the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>But, further, the controversy of the proprietors of the church with him had reached such a state of feeling that charges were made against him at a meeting of the proprietors which impeached his integrity and honor in certain business affairs which he conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>These charges, I may say, briefly concerned his violation of an agreement as to the copyright of his <q direct="unspecified">American <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Class Book</q>; his contract to furnish letters during his trip abroad to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Boston Gazette">Boston Gazette</placeName></hi>, and his sale of the right to manufacture a razor-hone, which was not his invention, but had been loaned to him by a parishioner for the purpose of making <num value="1">one</num> for his own use. Such charges could not go unanswered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>To withdraw from his pulpit after they were made was to admit their truth and to have his reputation as a minister and a man hopelessly ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>In order that the case might be heard and decided by a competent tribunal, an appeal was taken to a council of churches called by both parties to the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>This failed for the reason that the proprietors had changed the issue agreed upon, and he would not consent to be a party to the council on their terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>Then the proprietors took the next and only course left to them to bring about his dismission from their pulpit; they called an <hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi> council of churches preferring grounds of complaint against him and asking that he be regularly dismissed by the council because of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The council was summoned as an <hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi> council <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> called by the proprietors, but in the preliminary proceedings an understanding was reached between <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00086.00809" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName> and the proprietors, and it became a Mutual Ecclesiastical Council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>Both parties were represented by able lawyers, well known to the bar in their time, and it was nearly <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after the council assembled before it dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>Its sessions were not continuous, but they were frequent, and a large amount of evidence was presented.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>The unanimous opinion of the council, composed of the ministers and delegates of <num value="12">twelve</num> churches, was, <q direct="unspecified">That, although on such of the charges preferred against <persName n="Pierpont,Reverend,John,,," id="n0334.0007.00086.00810" reg="default:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName>, as most directly affect his moral character, the proof has been altogether insufficient, yet on other charges such an amount of proof has been brought forward as requires this council to express their disapprobation of <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00086.00811" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName>'s conduct on some occasions, and in some respects, but not sufficient, in their opinion, to furnish ground for advising a dissolution of the connection between him and his parish.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/></p> 
<p>That the decision of the council was a just <num value="1">one</num> there is every reason to believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/>But it was none too generous to him. For it was but a small number of his brethren in the ministry who supported him in his controversy, some thinking his course extreme, others thinking, as the council said, <q direct="unspecified">that it had been marked by a degree of harshness, personality, ridicule and sarcasm at variance with <name>Christian</name> meekness.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>They seem not to have understood him, and therefore were unable to put themselves in his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>A man of so strong characteristics must have the defects of his virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>Standing <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for truth and righteousness as the supreme things, and then for his integrity and honor, does not induce the gentleness of the dove, and that his speech should have been now severe and now mixed with scorn for meanness, would be what we have a right to expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/></p> 
<p>A word of explanation should also be said concerning the reasons why <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00087.00813" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName> was engaged in some matters of secular business which appear in this controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>At the time of the failure of the business with which he was connected in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, he refused to avail himself of the legal exemption from his debts, and held himself morally bound to pay them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>This laid upon him a considerable burden, and his engagements in business during his ministry were for the purpose of discharging that obligation, an obligation which he faithfully kept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>He was <num value="1">one</num> who preached righteousness and practiced it. Let it be remembered to his honor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>It has been painful to go into the question at issue between <persName n="Pierpont,Mister,,,," id="n0334.0007.00087.00814" reg="nearbymention:Pierpont,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierpont</surname></persName> and his parish to the extent I have felt obliged to do, but it is a matter of history, and the fair fame of a man we have much reason to regard is at stake, a man of fine gifts, a self-sacrificing lover of his kind, and it is best we should see him as he was. The council dissolved in <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1059"/>He continued his ministry for a time with much dissent and bitterness on the part of the strong minority opposed to him. His salary was kept back to the amount of more than <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">three thousand dollars</measure>, and he had to bring suit to obtain it. Finally, against the advice of his friends in the church, in <dateStruct value="1845-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>,he voluntarily resigned his pastorate, and the long struggle was at an end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>After a period of rest he became minister of a church in <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1061"/>Singularly enough he came here to a church which had <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> suffered from the same causes he had been familiar with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>But for such as could bear his strong meat, who did not object to a religion mixed with morals, his ministry was a pure delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>His social charm, his remarkable gift as a reader of Scripture and hymns, the force and eloquence of his preaching were long remembered, and his influence was powerful for good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>Early in the war of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, when he was <measure n="76years" type="date">seventy-six years</measure> old, at his own request he received an appointment as <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> in the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 22">Twenty-second Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="MAVolunteer">Massachusetts Volunteers</orgName>, requesting of <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0007.00088.00815" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName> <q direct="unspecified">that the regiment should not go around <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1069"/>He was all these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>Most of all was he a lover of truth, so earnest that no frowns of the cultured and polite could keep him from espousing a cause which had won the conviction of his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1071"/>He accepted the then science of phrenology, though it brought opprobrium upon him. He was a believer in spiritualism, convinced that its phenomena justified its claims, and he did not cherish the belief in private, but advocated it on the platform, in gatherings set apart to teach and commend it. He was so good a patriot and so true a lover of humanity that for these he willingly sacrificed the enviable position he had held in the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1072"/>We cannot avoid the wish that truth and righteousness were so welcome in our world that a man of his worth could use his powers <pb id="p.89" n="89"/> to set the world farther forward rather than have to contend inch by inch for the good he loved and nobly served.
