<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>Whether, like the cypress, these trees suggest the <pb id="p.44" n="44"/> idea of the funeral torch or the monumental spire, whether their tremulous leaves make us afraid by sympathy with their nervous thrills, whether the faint balsamic smell of their leaves and their closely swathed limbs have in them vague hints of dead Pharaohs stiffened in their cerements, I will not guess; but they always seemed to me to give an air of sepulchral sadness to the house before which they stood sentries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The worst of a modern stylish mansion is, that it has no place for ghosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Now the old house had wainscots, behind which the mice were always scampering and squeaking and rattling down the plaster, and enacting family scenes and parlor theatricals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>It had a cellar where the cold slug clung to the walls, and the misanthropic spider withdrew from the garish day; where the green mould loved to grow, and the long white potato-shoots went feeling along the floor, if haply they might find the daylight; it had great brick pillars, always in a cold sweat with holding up the burden they had been aching under day and night for a century and more; it had sepulchral arches closed by rough doors that hung on hinges rotten with rust, behind which doors, if there was not a heap of bones connected with a mysterious disappearance of long ago, there well might have been, for it was just the place to look for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It had a garret, very nearly such a <num value="1">one</num> as it seems to me <num value="1">one</num> of us has described in <num value="1">one</num> of his books; but let us look at this <num value="1">one</num> as I can reproduce it from memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>For a garret is like a sea-shore, where wrecks are thrown up and slowly go to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>There is the cradle which the old man you just remember was rocked in; there is the ruin of the bedstead he died on; that ugly slanting contrivance used to be put under his pillow in the days when his breath came hard; there is his old chair with both arms gone, symbol of the desolate time when he had nothing earthly left to lean on; there is the large wooden reel which the blear-eyed old deacon sent the minister's lady, who thanked him graciously, and twirled it smilingly, and in fitting season bowed it out decently to the limbo of troublesome conveniences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>And there are old leather portmanteaus, like stranded porpoises, their mouths gaping in gaunt hunger for the food with which they used to be gorged to bulging repletion; and old brass andirons, waiting until time shall revenge them on their paltry substitutes, and they shall have their own again, and bring with them the forestick and the back-log of ancient days; and the empty churn, with its idle dasher, which the <name>Nancys</name> and Phoebes, who have left their comfortable places to the <name>Bridgets</name> and Norahs, used to handle to good purpose; and the brown, shaky old spinning-wheel, which was running, it may be, in the days when they were hanging the <rs>Salem</rs> witches.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Under the dark and haunted garret were attic chambers which themselves had histories.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>It is the purpose of this chapter to indicate the progress which <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> has made in municipal unity, and the growth and prosperity which have resulted from municipal action and direction, rather than to dwell upon the results of private effort during the past <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Well-directed, organized municipal energy has thus far nowhere characterized the growth of American municipalities; but in the new civic awakening which is now taking place in our country, in the application of scientific methods to the solution of the new problems created by dense population groups, and especially in the permanent elimination from its municipal life of that irritating factor, the legalized public dram-shop, <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> may well be pointed out as an illustration of the highest standard yet reached by American urban dwellers.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/><measure n="50years" type="date">Fifty years</measure> ago, that portion of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> people which lived within the limits of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> received the idea&mdash;although faintly and imperfectly at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>&mdash;of a municipal organism which should be responsible for the general welfare of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>It was by no means a Cambridge idea, and the people appear to have adopted it with reluctance, and only after long debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/><placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 6" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName> had had a charter life of nearly <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century before the movement to imitate its example began in the neighboring towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>A year later, <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> illustrated the general tendency by likewise becoming a city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Before this charter agitation of <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, there had been no new cities in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> since the incorporation of <placeName reg="Salem, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014447">Salem</placeName> and <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n0185.0006.00054.00258" reg="nearbymention:Lowell,J.,R.,,"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The rapid increase in the population and property of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> <pb id="p.55" n="55"/> in the years immediately preceding the adoption of the charter was the main reason for the change in its form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>From the national census of <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct> to the assessors' census of <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct> there had been an increase of <num value="0.48">48 per cent.</num> in the population,&mdash;a larger percentage than is recorded in any other <num value="5">five</num>-year period of the history of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>With this remarkable growth in population there had also been an increase of <num value="0.32">32 per cent.</num> in the town's valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>In <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct>, the administrative methods of the old town-meeting form of government were strained to meet the community needs of <num value="12490">12,490</num> people, and even then these needs were inadequately supplied.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>We are not now concerned, however, so much in the outward change in the form of government made by the people in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, as we are with the new conception of municipal life which had its birth at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>The great increase in population and wealth in the years immediately preceding the charter year had taken place largely in <placeName key="tgn,2215707" n="1.000 21" reg="cambridgeport, middlesex, massachusetts">Cambridgeport</placeName> and <placeName reg="East Cambridge">East Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The tendency of the centre of population toward <placeName reg="West Boston Bridge">West Boston Bridge</placeName> had always been regarded with ill favor by the conservative people who formed the colony around <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, and when, in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>, this tendency was emphasized by the erection of the new town-house on <address><street n="Norfolk Street">Norfolk Street</street></address> and the consequent final adjournment of the town meeting from the Old Village to the <name>Port</name>, open and determined attempts to divide the town were made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>These efforts to secede were met, on the other side, by a determination to effect <q direct="unspecified">a more perfect union.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>And thus a desire for better municipal service and a closer municipal unity found expression on the <dateStruct value="1846-03-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> day of <month reg="03">March</month>, <year>1846</year>,</dateStruct> in the acceptance of the charter by a vote of <num value="645">645</num> to <num value="224">224</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>But the new desire found many discouragements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>To unify the apparently diverse interests of the Old Village, the <name>Port</name>, and the <rs type="place">Point</rs>, <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago, was no easy task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>The division of the young city into separate communities&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">unavoidably accented by Nature,</q> as <num value="1">one</num> writer has said&mdash;was so marked that it was not surprising to find those who believed that the villages had no common interests which demanded a common government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Communication between the <num value="3">three</num> communities was slow, and at some seasons of the year even difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>In the school system the idea of town division had been carefully preserved, even to the extent of maintaining <num value="3">three</num> high schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>The <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">fire department</orgName>, although a unit in name, was composed <pb id="p.56" n="56"/> of volunteers, who not infrequently emphasized their sections to the detriment of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Thus through all the departments of the young city government the sectional idea was conspicuous, and the facts here cited as illustrations can be easily supplemented in large numbers by the recollection of any old resident.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>The desire for better municipal service was likewise met by many discouragements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>If we have in mind modern municipal standards, we must confess that <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> began its career as a city poorly equipped to provide for the common needs of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>No <num value="1">one</num> now questions that the building and maintenance of bridges across the <placeName key="tgn,1122705" n="1.000 1" reg="Charles River, Massachusetts, United States, North and Central America">Charles River</placeName> is a proper municipal function; yet in <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, instead of being city property, the <num value="2">two</num> principal bridges to <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 6" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName> were owned by private corporations, authorized to exact tolls for their use.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>It would require a long story to tell all that the young city of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> failed to provide for its people which now, by universal assent, is demanded of every modern municipality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>We may indicate some of these failures, in the briefest possible way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>The city gave to the citizens but little protection from the acts of lawless persons, and while it cannot be said that lawlessness prevailed, it must be admitted that the safety of person and property then depended far more upon individual vigilance and less upon municipal police protection than at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>It is outside the scope of this chapter to discuss the social conditions of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and it might be asserted by some that in social life the old sectional distinctions are still maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Yet even here it must be confessed that sectional feeling is now based more upon a tradition than upon any present distinction, and that it is growing weaker as the years pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>But so far as municipal action is concerned, the close of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half century of charter life finds sectional and ward lines nearly obliterated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>Especially is this to be seen in the <num value="2">two</num> greatest municipal enterprises in which <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> ever engaged.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>To the water-supply system and the park system, separate chapters are devoted elsewhere in this volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>A consideration of but a single phase in the development of these enterprises is here intended, and that merely as an illustration of municipal unity of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>The Water Board consists of <num value="5">five</num> commissioners, that number having originally been fixed because there were <num value="5">five</num> wards in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Yet seldom, in the composition of this board, has the ward representative idea been insisted upon, and never, perhaps, have ward considerations controlled the greater enterprises of this department of city works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>In the establishment and extension of the water-supply system the needs of no less a factor than the city as a whole have been studied, and the work has been prosecuted upon this line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The same quality and quantity of water (so far as topographical conditions would permit) have flowed into the homes of all the wards, illustrating the impartiality with which the rains from heaven are said to descend upon the just and unjust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Certainly the introduction and extension of our water supply has been an important factor in the development of municipal unity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>It is a fact of much significance as illustrative of the tendency in municipal life, that the <num value="13000">thirteen thousand</num> people who <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> ago drank from a <num value="1000">thousand</num> wells have now grown to <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> people, drinking from <num value="1">one</num> common well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>When, in <dateStruct value="1893--"><year reg="1893">1893</year></dateStruct>, the board of Park Commissioners was created, the conventional number of <num value="5">five</num> was ignored altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Instead, the board was made to consist of <num value="3">three</num> commissioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/><pb id="p.62" n="62"/> The work of this board in laying out a municipal system of parks has been upon as strictly a scientific basis as has been any of the much-praised work of the <rs>European</rs> municipalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The map upon which the park lines were drawn had no trace of ward boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>The topographical features of the city area, and the recreative needs of the people with reference only to density of population, are the considerations upon which the <rs>Cambridge</rs> park system is based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>This is notable from the fact that all previous agitation for parks (and it had been long drawn out) was based upon the ward idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Previous to <dateStruct value="1893--"><year reg="1893">1893</year></dateStruct>, the question of parks was seldom discussed in a broader way than with reference to the needs of a single ward.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Other lines of municipal work might also be mentioned to illustrate the unity of plan and action with which the city is now prosecuting its enterprises; but enough has been written to show what has been attained, and to indicate what may be expected in the future in the application of organic municipal energy in the development of the resources of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>In this sketch of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> municipal development nothing has been said, individually, of those who have occupied public places, or who have as private citizens been conspicuous in the service which they have rendered the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>It would require a long chapter merely to record the names of all those who are worthy of mention in the half century of work now closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>Unlike some other cities, no single name stands above all others; yet there are not a few names, any <num value="1">one</num> of which represents long service, high ideals, rare intelligence, and a civic pride which, if found in some less favored community, would make its possessor the hero of a city's half century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>It would be a privilege to dwell upon the service of some of those who have most contributed to the municipal activities of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, but this falls outside the purpose of the chapter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>The writer must, however, record the conviction that few cities in our country during the past <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> have been so richly endowed with service as has <persName n="Cambridge,,,,," id="n0185.0006.00062.00271" reg="mostcommon:Cambridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambridge</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>At the beginning of its charter life, <persName n="Green,Mayor,James,D.,," id="n0185.0006.00062.00272" reg="default:Green,James,D.,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Green</surname></persName> set the example of uprightness, ability, and faithful work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>In a eulogy delivered not long before his death, <persName n="Peabody,Reverend,Andrew,P.,," id="n0185.0006.00062.00273" reg="default:Peabody,Andrew,P.,,"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName> called attention to the standard set by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mayor and the faithfulness with which it had been maintained by his successors, and, for the most part, by all who have held public office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>The memory of all this service <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> is indeed a rich inheritance and an inspiration to those who take up the work of the next <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of the municipal life of <persName n="Cambridge,,,,," id="n0185.0006.00063.00274" reg="mostcommon:Cambridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambridge</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>During the <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of the charter, <num value="22">twenty-two</num> citizens have served as mayor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>The years in which each administered the office, and also the important personal facts regarding them, may be gathered from the following table:&mdash;

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>The government of a city depends upon the disposition of a majority of its citizens holding the same views and acting together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>The object of good city government is the efficient and economical administration of a city's affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>This object is often thwarted by political or private interests inconsistent with it. Partisanship may be eliminated from the conduct of city affairs, and so may the influence of private interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>It is doubtless true that both are rarely eliminated altogether, but it is true also that so far as they are eliminated there is a corresponding rise in the standard of efficiency and economy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>The distinctive feature of municipal government in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> is its non-partisanship,&mdash;not bi-partisanship, such as is exemplified by a board made up, in accordance with a requirement of law or by agreement, of an equal number of Democrats and of Republicans, but, literally and actually, non-partisanship in which membership in a national <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName> has to do with the selection of officials only as membership in a church, or in a society, or social standing, or wealth, or vocation, or peculiar views, have to do with this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>Undoubtedly <num value="1">one</num> or more of these considerations make for or against the election of a certain candidate in the minds of some voters, as his political faith does in the minds of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>So they do in the choice of a lawyer or doctor or business agent, but they are not ordinarily taken into account by most people when selecting a lawyer or doctor or business agent, and the national party to which a candidate belongs is not taken into account by the <persName n="Cambridge,Representative,,,," id="n0185.0009.00078.00382" reg="mostcommon:Cambridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Representative">representative</roleName> <surname>Cambridge</surname></persName> voter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Fitness for the particular office, to be determined by the candidate's honesty, ability, and experience so far as the voter has information about these qualities, is the governing <pb id="p.79" n="79"/> consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Twice only within the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> have partisan nominations been made at a city election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Each time scarce a candidate thus nominated was elected, and the disapproval of the partisan proceeding shown by the voters, including a large number of the members of the party whose committee caused the nominations to be made, could hardly have been more emphatic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>In the administration of <persName n="Cambridge,,,,," id="n0185.0009.00079.00383" reg="mostcommon:Cambridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambridge</surname></persName> affairs partisan considerations have even less a place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Indeed, so far as can be determined by the proceedings of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName> and by the doings of city officials, they have no place whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>On the floor of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName>, or in committee rooms, <num value="1">one</num> hears no allusion to political parties, and there is nothing to indicate that they are ever thought of in connection with city matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Heads of departments, members of boards, and subordinate officials are selected without regard to their political faith, and for years, certainly, it has never been charged that the city's service is used for partisan purposes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Municipal parties exist, however, apparently more to favor the candidacy of certain individuals, than to support a given municipal policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Nominally all agree, or have agreed for many years, to what is called a pay-as-you-go policy; that is, as it is generally stated, the payment of current expenses with current revenue, debt to be incurred only for large and extraordinary undertakings in which the future also is to share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>Actually, however, there is a disagreement in the construction of what are current expenses, and there is also a difference in the selection of officials, and in the methods of transacting business, as well as in the administration of many of the concerns of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>While these disagreements and differences are not always expressly defined, they are nevertheless clearly discernible by those familiar with city business, and they furnish a plenty of reasons for the eternal vigilance which is the price of good city government even where the division along national party lines is disregarded in municipal affairs.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Accustomed to promote the welfare of the municipality and not that of a <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, the members of the <rs type="place">Cambridge city</rs> government are less susceptible to private interests than they would be, were not the interests of the city paramount to all others in their minds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/><placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> therefore has been free from <q direct="unspecified">jobs.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The corruptionist has had little encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/><pb id="p.80" n="80"/></p> 
<p>Another feature of municipal government in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>&mdash;a direct result of non-partisanship&mdash;is the retention of city officials in office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>It would be hard to find an instance where an official had been removed, except for cause, and happily there have been few such cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>It is customary also to promote subordinates when a vacancy occurs, and as a result, there are many officials who have spent the best part of their lives in the city's service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>The machinery of the city government of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> is vested in a mayor, a <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName> of <num value="2">two</num> branches, a <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName>, and a board of assessors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/>The mayor, <rs type="role" n="Alderman">aldermen</rs>, <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName>, and board of assessors are elected by a plurality vote of all the voters of the city, but each ward is entitled to <num value="3">three</num> members of the <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>The common councilmen are elected by wards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>All other boards and all heads of departments are either appointed by the mayor subject to the confirmation of the <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName> (and this method applies to most), or they are chosen by a vote of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Boards and heads of departments appoint all their subordinates, except in the police and fire departments, and except also in the cases of the assistant assessors and the assistant city clerk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>In the police and fire departments, the subordinates are appointed by the mayor subject to the confirmation of the <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName>, and the same is true of the assistant assessors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>The assistant city clerk is elected by the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>After due hearing, with the approval of a majority of the <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName>, the mayor may remove any member of the board of overseers of the poor or of the <orgName n="Health Board" type="board">board of health</orgName>, and any other officer or member of a board appointed by him. The mayor is not a member of either branch of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>The executive powers of the city are vested in him, and he is also surveyor of highways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>All executive boards and officers are at all times accountable to him for the proper discharge of their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>The mayor has a qualified veto power over the doings of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName>, and of the <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName>; all contracts over <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> require his approval before going into effect, and he submits annually to the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName> the estimates of money required for the respective departments with his recommendations on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>No expenditure can be made and no liability incurred for any purpose beyond the appropriation previously made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>To the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName> or to the <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName> are given all the powers of the <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> city not given to the mayor, the <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName>, and other public officers prescribed by general law. The <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName> makes ordinances and provides for the appointment of certain officers, defines their powers and duties, and fixes their compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>It also has authority to lay out, alter, and discontinue ways, to take land for them, and for the construction of sewers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>The <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName> may authorize the construction of sidewalks, and must assess the expense of the materials upon the abutting lands, which then become chargeable for the payment of the amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>The <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName> fixes the number and compensation of policemen, and establishes general regulations for their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>It also has the power to grant and revoke licenses for which provision is made by law or ordinance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>The <orgName n="School Committee" type="committee">school committee</orgName>, of which the mayor is <hi rend="italics">ex officio</hi> chairman without a vote, performs all such duties as the school committees in <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 68" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName> towns are required by law to perform.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>The essential difference between the form of city government of to-day and that in vogue from the time <rs>Cambridge</rs> became a city, up to <dateStruct value="1892--"><year reg="1892">1892</year></dateStruct>, is in the assignment of executive power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Formerly, it was given to the mayor and <orgName n="Aldermen Board" type="board">board of aldermen</orgName> or to the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">city council</orgName>, and was exercised through their committees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Now, it is given to the mayor, and is exercised through the boards and heads of departments, under his general supervision and control. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>His later years, spent elsewhere, had with deep religious spirit been devoted to good works, which broadened his life out into the lives of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>With noble generosity and fine public spirit, he gave largely to the communities where he dwelt, and also richly blessed this city of his birth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>For many years <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> had felt the need of a public library that would meet the requirements of the people of a large and growing city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>Some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, a phrase broke in upon our <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> speech with such suddenness, energy, and large significance as are hard even yet to realize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1005"/>Who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> used it I do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>My impression is that our present Superintendent of <persName n="Parks,,,,," id="n0185.0011.00087.00417" reg="mostcommon:Parks,Charles,,,:1"><surname>Parks</surname></persName>, then a leading writer on our <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> newspapers, was <num value="1">one</num> of the earliest to apprehend its potency, and that he with his skillful pen somewhat furthered its becoming widely used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>But whoever it may have been that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> uttered it, and however serviceable the writer alluded to, or any other persons, may have been in bringing it into current use, certain it is that it survived and became a power of its own accord, and in a way that no single individual or group of individuals could either have initiated or prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>It was like a new star coming into the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>It was like a newly discovered force offering itself to the uses of man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>That phrase stands at the head of this article; and the privilege has been accorded me of giving some account of the circumstances which rendered possible this phenomenon of human speech, and which led up to its making itself a felt power among us. I am desired, also, if I shall be able, to suggest its sweep, its puissance, and its vast promise among us for the time to come.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, however, a word more about the phrase itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>Everybody began using it. It expressed something to their minds which had before been inexpressible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>This was the secret of its popularity and of its ever-growing force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>Moreover, its use was not confined to any single class or type of persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1015"/>The most cultivated men and women in our city, plain daylabor-ers, individuals of very large insight and vision, persons of the most circumscribed intellectual endowment, children, old people, those of all varieties of opinion and shades of ideas,&mdash; <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> alike introduced this phrase into their vocabulary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>It struck a universal chord in the minds and hearts of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>Another peculiarity of the phrase was its indefinableness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>After it had come into use, and had been conjured by for several years, there appeared not long ago in <num value="1">one</num> of our newspapers a <q direct="unspecified">symposium,</q> contributed to by many of our foremost citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1019"/>The purpose of this broadside was, if possible, to define <q direct="unspecified">The Cambridge Idea.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1020"/>I do not know where, in so small space, so much good civics can be found as in that broadside, which ought to be printed and spread widely over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1021"/>The curious thing about the many articles contributed was that they greatly differed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1022"/>They embraced the largest variety of sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1023"/>Each writer was sure that what he mentioned was precisely what the phrase meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1024"/>The chairman of the <rs>Harvard Board</rs> of Preachers, in addressing a large audience in a campaign of ours <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, essayed to define it as <q direct="unspecified">The Christian Idea.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1025"/>Another speaker, also before a large audience in a later campaign, made bold to affirm that <q direct="unspecified">The Cambridge Idea</q> was not an idea at all, but an ideal, <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>'s ideality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/>It is not improbable that this speaker, like the preceding, was right; but it is beyond question that, had the phrase started under the name of <q direct="unspecified">Ideal</q> or <q direct="unspecified">Ideality,</q> it would not have survived a day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>That must be a very large symbol of thought which could become, so soon, so abidingly, amongst such diverse persons, within such a large population, and with such spontaneity, such a standard or measure of civic and ethical values, as this phenomenal state of things indicates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>Furthermore, there is something nobly inspiring about it, and that quite independently of neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>I have seen, for example, many audiences beyond <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and even beyond <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, gathered to listen to some account of what has been happening among us, who&mdash;when this point of the description was reached, and the striking circumstance was held forth of a great and heterogeneous city bowing to the sway of such a phrase as this, and of its profound and transcendental meaning&mdash;would give way to the most enthusiastic applause, so that they needed, in some instances, to be restrained, if the speech were to go on; and I have known them to express the heartfelt desire that such a phrase might break forth likewise amongst them, and become equally regnant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/><pb id="p.89" n="89"/></p> 
<p>The task assigned me is exceedingly difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>It would be easier to write a book on the subject than a brief article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>I greatly fear, moreover, that I shall be unable to do the subject any justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>For I am to write of a subtle and spirit-like thing, having to do with that place where thoughts are born, and where aspirations acquire for themselves wings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>The reader will readily see that nothing could be easier than almost or altogether to miss the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>However, I must try; and, as condensedly and suggestively as I may be able, I shall throw out some imperfect sketch of that which almost defies delineation or explication.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>It is now <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century or more, therefore, since we have tolerated partisanship in our municipal affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>Other fine traits and realizations of a civic nature have been long among us: the idea, for example, of municipal office as a municipal trust, the notion that the city must be administered as faithfully and sagaciously as any business concern of highest standing; various memorable battles as between the sons of Belial and the children of light in civic directions, which had stirred our city profoundly prior to the last decade; the wonderfully tonic prestige of large victories in these directions, and much more to the same purport.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>All this constituted our more immediate political heritage down to <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> ago.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>It had had a glorious past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1045"/>That past was such as to make it all alive with noblest civic and ethical impulses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1046"/>That past, for now a good number of years, had been rendering possible the abolition of partisanship in municipal affairs, and certain great and victorious struggles betwixt the baser and the nobler elements in the city's life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1047"/>But now there was creeping like a paralysis over the city that <pb id="p.91" n="91"/> chief modern foe to good civics, the power of the rum traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1048"/>A sharp distinction is to be drawn between drink itself, and the questions having to do with it, and that greater abomination, the organized, covetous, unscrupulous traffic, which, making merchandise of human souls for its own aggrandizement, works the most fearful evils in almost all dense populations.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1049"/><placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, by her local-option law of <dateStruct value="1881--"><year reg="1881">1881</year></dateStruct>, had been giving her cities and towns the opportunity to throw off this paralysis, and many of them had taken advantage of it, including our border city of <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>, which, for some years, had excluded the saloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1050"/>The result was that <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> had to do a large part of <placeName reg="Somerville, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050602">Somerville</placeName>'s liquor business as well as her own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/><num value="1">One</num> of these transactions, the notorious DeWire case near <placeName key="tgn,2101458" n="1.000 10" reg="Shady Hill, Henderson, Tennessee">Shady Hill</placeName>, produced tremendous indignation in the university, in addition to the discontent which was widely diffused throughout the city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>What would most cities have done under such circumstances?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>They would have had a wild, not to say fanatic, outburst of indignation, hot speeches, a no-license vote for <num value="1">one</num> year, an ill enforcement of the vote, and after <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> rum back again worse than ever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>Not so did our city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>Being deeply religious as it is, the churches joined together, and there was a tremendous religious campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1056"/>But being also intensely practical as the city is, a large, representative, and non-partisan committee was organized, which canvassed our entire voting-lists in the interest of no-license, and printed a paper called <q direct="unspecified">Frozen Truth,</q> which was distributed to all voters, and in which the cold facts about the saloon, the <q direct="unspecified">congealed veracity</q> as somebody called it, were laid before our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1057"/>Moreover this committee organized a most efficient campaign, personally, at the polling-places by the use of check lists, and so forth.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1058"/>The result was, in <dateStruct value="1886-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>, the overthrow of the saloon by a majority of <num value="566">566</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1060"/>In the mean time a Law Enforcement Association was organized, with the paradoxical purpose of <hi rend="italics">never enforcing the law;</hi> but, the rather, of fixing the responsibility upon the proper officers, of supplying them with information, of holding up their hands, of seeing that large praise came to them for all faithful work, and of focusing the intelligence and indignation of the city upon all dereliction of duty in this regard.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1062"/>The saloon-keepers, however, were cheerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1063"/>They held on to their leases, and threatened to bury us the next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1064"/>They reckoned on the precedent of such revulsions in other cities, where the thorough methods employed by us had not been in use.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1065"/>Our leaders in this effort, as the next election drew near, went around among our principal citizens, asking, in the interest simply of fair play, more than <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> in which to try tile experiment; and so reasonable were our people, even many of those who doubted the wisdom of the permanent exclusion of the saloon, that they acceded to this request.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1066"/>The same kind of campaign as that of <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>, only much further perfected in its details, was waged that year; and, though the conflict was tremendous, and each side polled nearly <dateStruct value="1400--"><year reg="1400">1400</year></dateStruct> more votes than in <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>, the saloon was beaten the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year by the identical majority, <num value="566">566</num>, which had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> abolished it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1068"/>Consequently our literature, our speakers, our methods of <pb id="p.93" n="93"/> campaigning, in fact, everything that could throw light on our unique struggle, were in constant demand from widely over the <rs>State</rs>, and from beyond it. <placeName reg="Chelsea, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015012">Chelsea</placeName>, in particular, being in a worse condition than we had been, and in a county involving great difficulties in the enforcement of liquor laws, studied carefully our methods, and very soon following them, threw out the saloon, and thus became, hardly less than <persName n="Cambridge,,,,," id="n0185.0011.00093.00426" reg="mostcommon:Cambridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Cambridge</surname></persName> herself, although under <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>'s inspiration, an argument in the same direction.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1070"/>This has been the more inevitable because of the startling and convincing array of results of our saloon exclusion, to which, most briefly, I am about to allude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1081"/><num value="7">7</num>. As the result of the exclusion of the saloon, though doubtless other causes have had some part in the same, it may be mentioned that our population has increased nearly twice as fast as before the saloon went; that the quality of the increase has much improved; that new houses began to be built twice or <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> thrice as rapidly; that our valuation had increased&mdash;some <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago when such statistics were most exhaustively compiled&mdash;over the old rate of increase in the corresponding period under the saloon, <measure n="6000000dollars" type="currency">$6,000,000</measure>, enough, it should be said, to bring into the city treasury, on the average rate of assessment, <measure n="90000dollars" type="currency">$90,000</measure> clean money, in the room of perhaps <measure n="60000dollars" type="currency">$60,000</measure> which might have been received of filthy money from the saloon; and that, instead of above a <num value="1000">thousand</num> tramps who used to be accommodated in our station houses annually, hardly more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> had been entertained annually during the same space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1082"/>Our new savings banks deposits, moreover, in the year referred to stood, in round numbers, <measure n="586000dollars" type="currency">$586,000</measure>, as against <measure n="140000dollars" type="currency">$140,000</measure> the last year of the saloon; while the new depositors of that year were <dateStruct value="1992--"><year reg="1992">1992</year></dateStruct>, as against <num value="861">861</num> the last year of the saloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1083"/>Furthermore, not a small part of these increased deposits was going back to workingmen for the building of their homes; and this says nothing of the upspringing of several prosperous cooperative banks which were doing much the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1084"/>Our manufacturers, our merchants, and our employers of labor in general, testified year by year, through the columns of the <q direct="unspecified">Frozen Truth,</q> to the increased sobriety, industry, skill, and efficiency of their work-people, owing to the absence of the saloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1085"/>Physicians, clergymen, charity workers, and all persons at all familiar with the actual conditions of the great bulk of our population, bore witness in the same direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1086"/>But all this, I must remind the reader, is only a partial summary of the tangible specific results growing out of the exclusion of the saloon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/>I indicate in addition&mdash;hardly more, however, than mentioning them&mdash;<num value="3">three</num> supreme results:&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>(<num value="1">1</num>) Our city government has been cleansed, steadily improved, and continuously elevated in its ideals and in the quality of its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1089"/>The young woman who, with her <q direct="unspecified">best young man,</q> going down <address><street n="Main Street">Main Street</street></address> <num value="1">one</num> moonlight night, paused with him before our new <placeName reg="city hall">city hall</placeName>, and, after a friendly dispute about what was the chief glory of that building, <q direct="unspecified">scored,</q> as the young man admitted, by declaring that the most beautiful thing about that building was that there had never been a liquor license signed within it,&mdash;expressed, in a nutshell, the substance of the matter in this direction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>(<num value="2">2</num>) In the second place, previously existing lines of division have been wiped out. <persName n="Catholics,,,,," id="n0185.0011.00095.00430" reg="mostcommon:Catholics,nomatch:0"><surname>Catholics</surname></persName> have come to love Protestants, <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> and Protestants to love <persName n="Catholics,,,,," id="n0185.0011.00096.00431" reg="mostcommon:Catholics,nomatch:0"><surname>Catholics</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1091"/>Evangelicals have come to love unevangelicals, and unevangelicals to love evangelicals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Betwixt Republicans, too, and Democrats, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num> Party people, and so forth, the same state of things has come to obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Those hateful lines, also, of local jealousy or antagonism between the original <hi rend="italics">nuclei</hi> of the city, <placeName reg="East Cambridge">East Cambridge</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2215707" n="1.000 21" reg="cambridgeport, middlesex, massachusetts">Cambridgeport</placeName>, North Cambridge, and Old Cambridge, have been largely obliterated, so that we have become <num value="1">one</num> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>This has been the outcome of that great price of agitation and of united toil whereby we have obtained our newer freedom.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>(<num value="3">3</num>) There is <num value="1">one</num> other result, the highest of all. It is that the name of which is put in quotation marks at the head of this article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>For when, having a polling-list of <num value="12000">12,000</num> or <num value="13000">13,000</num>, and being unable year by year (until this last) to get a majority greater than <num value="843">843</num> (though it never fell lower than <num value="486">486</num>), it was obvious each year that the city, by but the turn of a few votes in a <num value="100">hundred</num>, might bring back the saloon, it could not but follow that the friends of the saloon, aided by the rum money of <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 6" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName> and of other places, would make a tremendous fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Such has been the fact; and consequently, every year, the result has been in exceeding great doubt, and our struggle has been something fearful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>It has followed from this fierce annual conflict that the whole city has been aroused; that we have had, annually, a month of what has been virtually a public institute <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> of civics and of practical ethics; and that, to a degree which no <num value="1">one</num> not a resident can realize, all the best forces of our city, irrespective of creed, or politics, or social rank, have been fused together and uplifted with <num value="1">one</num> common moral and spiritual impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1104"/>It was about midway of that struggle that suddenly, as I stated in the opening paragraph of this article, but as naturally as great thoughts are born ever out of the fierce travail of our race, the phrase, <q direct="unspecified">The Cambridge Idea</q> broke in upon our <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>Of this I shall have a word more to say as I close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>Let it suffice now to remark that in this idealism, this stirring up of the largest and best civic thought of which every right-meaning person in the city is capable, the supreme result of our <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of struggle registers itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/><num value="8">8</num>. Only a few sentences now, as to methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/>These have been: (<num value="1">1</num>) No candidates,&mdash;that is, as no-license men, we have not, in that capacity, had anything to do with candidates; (<num value="2">2</num>) No politics,&mdash;in the same sense; (<num value="3">3</num>) No temperance shibboleths,&mdash;that is, a platform broad enough to include all haters of the saloon, even though they might be drinking men; (<num value="4">4</num>) Dividing the question,&mdash;that is, the concentrating of attention solely upon this issue, Shall, or shall not the saloon come back? (<num value="5">5</num>) A campaign of facts,&mdash;that is, the leaving of abstractions, and a thorough inductive inquiry as to the relative effects of the saloon with us and the saloon gone; (<num value="6">6</num>) An entirely independent, and yet an absolutely harmonious and mutually helpful twofold campaign,&mdash;the <num value="1">one</num> religious, in the <rs type="place">Catholic</rs> and <placeName reg="Protestant church">Protestant churches</placeName>, and the other purely secular and along such lines that all right-minded men could join upon the <num value="1">one</num> issue raised; (<num value="7">7</num>) Hard work,&mdash;work as if <num value="1">one</num> vote might decide the question.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/><num value="9">9</num>. Leaving now the <hi rend="italics">resume</hi> which I have given of the most distinctive movement, in civic directions, which has marked our city from <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct> until this present, a few words require to be added about the relation of all this to the larger life of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/>Let no man, then, suppose that there has been anything fanatical about this movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>It has been eminently rational, sane, and practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>When <persName n="Eliot,President,,,," id="n0185.0011.00097.00435" reg="mostcommon:Eliot,Charles,William,,:4"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>, addressing an immense audience in <placeName reg="Union Hall, Lafayette, Mississippi" key="tgn,2738780">Union Hall</placeName> <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> since, stated how radically in temperance theory he differed probably from most of those present, but proceeded to testify that he <pb id="p.98" n="98"/> had for several years voted No, and was about to do so again, partly because a license policy could not, in the present temper of the city, be enforced, but more because the city had been educated up to the point where it could do without the saloon, he gave to our movement the highest praise, from a large point of view, that it has ever received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>The praise was the more noble because it was entirely and absolutely true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>Furthermore, the city got upon this thing because it had to; because the forces already at work within itself drove it along this path as by an irresistible impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>It was a stage of civic evolution which had to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>Still further, let it not be forgotten that, though the exclusion of the saloon and the superb cognate results which have followed therefrom have constituted the most striking outward feature of all these unfoldings, nevertheless, this, as it were, has been but a drop in the bucket beside that larger movement of which it has been a part, whereby a profound civic sense, civic consciousness, civic purpose, and civic consecration have become the normal temper of our great and heterogeneous population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>As a New Testament writer urges his readers to <q direct="unspecified">lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset</q> them, so <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, joining battle with <num value="1">one</num> special besetting sin, has toned up all the forces which make for righteousness within it, has won for itself a living unity, has brought itself under the sway of vast constructive ideals, and has thus been, in very deed, laying aside every weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>And as I believe it is true that, in our university, civics and economics are taught as they are nowhere else taught in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, so I believe that the young men let out from its lecture-rooms have only to repair to our <placeName reg="city hall">city hall</placeName>, and to walk through all our borders, to find practical illustrations of good civics and economics which cannot be paralleled in the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/><num value="10">10</num>. Thus has it come to pass that, <measure n="265years" type="date">two hundred and sixty-five years</measure> from the founding of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> from the organization of its present form of government, the most glorious decade of its entire history is also rounding out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/>Thus, moreover, was it, that when, <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, there broke into <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> speech&mdash;so suddenly, with such energy, and with such large significance, that these can hardly yet be realized&mdash;the phrase, <q direct="unspecified">The Cambridge Idea,</q> that spiritual ideal, that conception of a city of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on earth, that indefinable aspiration through which alone either individuals or communities may come to their highest, found a language and a watchword which held within itself the secret of our city's destiny.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1122"/>&mdash;Should I be quite true to my profession, or to a habit which I have had in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> during the best years of my life, if I failed, as I close, to drop into a few sentences of special exhortation in naming a very particular type of reasons why we should all be dedicated to <q direct="unspecified">The Cambridge Idea,</q> and should go forward with our whole might into the realization of that measureless and as yet unimaginable future which, through its puissance, lies before our dear city?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>To-day, with the exception of a few <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure>, the entire littoral is in the hands of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1265"/>The progressive improvement of the river's banks under public control will force the wholesome recovery of all the abutting lowlands at private initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>The transformation of the desolation that threatened the well-being of the people, that mortally offended the sense of the beautiful, that foreboded a staggering burden of public debt, has so far progressed that the quick consummation of the hopes of the past may be confidently anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1280"/>The water was brought in wooden logs, and a limited amount was supplied in the lower Port for many years.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1286"/><placeName reg="Spy Pond, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1119322">Spy Pond</placeName> afterwards was, however, condemned as a source of supply for domestic use, and no water was drawn from it for the use of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, but the waters of <placeName reg="Wellington Brook, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2756536">Wellington Brook</placeName> and <placeName key="possibilities=54" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Little Pond</placeName> helped furnish a supply for several years by being brought into <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fresh Pond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1297"/>Before the city bought out the private companies, there was a difference of opinion among some of our best citizens as to whether it was best to buy, or not, some thinking that a department would be created in which jobs would be let out detrimental to the city, an enterprise which private effort had failed to make profitable, and that it would be likely to become a financial burden, if the city took it. Others thought differently, and could see no good reason why the <orgName n="Water Works" type="works">water-works</orgName> should not be managed on business principles and take care of themselves.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1298"/>The city voted to buy out the private companies, and paid <measure n="291400dollars" type="currency">$291,400</measure> (for which amount bonds were issued), at the same time agreeing that all extensions of the <orgName n="Water Works" type="works">water-works</orgName> should be provided for by bonds and surplus water rates, after paying current expenses.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>It is interesting to note some of the changes which, in the course of the growth of the city, have taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>The rapid introduction of manufacturing establishments near the shores of the river, in the easterly part of the city, has multiplied the number of homes for the wage-earner, and very many of those whose residences were there, desiring to improve their surroundings, have removed, and a considerable population has settled west of <address><street n="Prospect Street">Prospect Street</street></address>, which forms the easterly boundary of <num value="1">one</num> of the pleasantest residential sections in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>If our present population were distributed throughout our city on the liberal scale which formerly prevailed, each family being allowed a yard for light, air, and children's playground, there would not be a single unoccupied lot in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and therefore we must patiently view the introduction of the various forms of apartment houses which promote a form of living which has many disadvantages, yet offers compensation in economy of labor and money.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>The extension of the <rs type="place">West End Street</rs> Railway track through <address><street n="Concord avenue">Concord</street></address> and <address><street n="Huron avenue">Huron Avenues</street></address>, and the widening and extension of the latter avenue, have aided in the development of a large territory, much of which is at a considerable elevation, and overlooks <persName n="Park,,Kingsley,,," id="n0185.0015.00129.00500" reg="default:Park,Kingsley,,,"><foreName>Kingsley</foreName> <surname>Park</surname></persName> and <placeName key="possibilities=23" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fresh Pond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>A rapid growth in this section of our city may be predicted, as hundreds of acres of available land await and invite occupancy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>It is impossible to measure the increased value to the <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs> interests of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> made by the park improvements, near the shores of the <placeName key="tgn,1122705" n="1.000 1" reg="Charles River, Massachusetts, United States, North and Central America">Charles River</placeName>, the reconstruction of the <rs type="place">Boylston</rs> and <placeName reg="Brookline bridge">Brookline bridges</placeName>, and the building of a bridge at the foot of <address><street n="Magazine Street">Magazine Street</street></address>, authorized by recent enactment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>With such advantages, it is not surprising that the growth of the city is rapid, symmetrical, and healthful.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/><measure n="30years" type="date">Thirty years</measure> ago <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> was a college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/>The whole system of discipline was adapted to youth and immaturity of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>The student was under the eye of the college every hour of the day and night; his courses of study were marked out for him, lessons from the textbooks were given from day to day. He was under tutelage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>In harmony with this system he was required to go to daily prayers and to <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>To be sure there was an occasional protest that religion stood on a different footing from studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/>But the answer was reasonable that in the development of the boy, religion had its place with study, and why should it not be under the same rules?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>Thus at an early hour every morning the college bell, under the faithful charge of <q direct="unspecified">Old Jones</q> as he was affectionately called, caused several <num value="100">hundred</num> young men to leap from a deep <pb id="p.162" n="162"/> sleep into their clothes and make their hurried way along the muddy paths and around the puddles of the yard to the chapel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>The whole college could then be accommodated in the chapel, though at that time it had no side galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/>It was popularly supposed that <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n0185.0020.00162.00653" reg="mostcommon:Jones,Charles,L.,,:6"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> was not as faithful at the furnace as he was at the bell; but perhaps the fault was with the furnace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>With upturned coat-collars, the students watched good old <persName n="Peabody,Doctor,,,," id="n0185.0020.00162.00654" reg="nearbymention:Peabody,F.,G.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName> remove his spectacles to read the <name>Scriptures</name> and then replace them to offer prayer; they then joined heartily in <num value="1">one</num> of the familiar hymns and after the benediction broke away for breakfast.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>It has become the fashion in these latter days to speak of the prayers of early times as worse than useless, and to emphasize the irreverence of students compelled to pray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>While there was irreverence sometimes, and though the <rs>Doctor</rs> was occasionally warned by a knocking on the pews if he prayed too long, yet the great body of the young men were reverent, and many of them entered devoutly into the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/><num value="2">Two</num> things at least were impressive and affected the lives of the students, &mdash;the daily contact with the simple and pure character of <persName n="Peabody,Doctor,,,," id="n0185.0020.00162.00655" reg="nearbymention:Peabody,F.,G.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName> and the hearty singing of the closing hymn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/>With the development of the elective system under <persName n="Eliot,President,,,," id="n0185.0020.00162.00656" reg="mostcommon:Eliot,Charles,William,,:4"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Eliot</surname></persName>, the larger freedom in discipline and the greater maturity of the students, the old religious system gradually became discordant with the prevailing note of college life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/>Religious institutions are conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/>It was natural therefore that the proposition of a new method should make its way slowly into the confidence of the officers of the college and of the community.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>Formerly studies, recitations, and prayers had been considered as duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/>Under the new regime, elective studies and lectures were lifted to the plane of privileges,&mdash;why not prayers as well?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>Gradually the responsibility as to the attendance of the students at <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> worship was removed from the college to the parents, and then to the students themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>The last thing that <orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> wanted to do was to weaken the forces of religion in the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>The problem was how, under the new conditions, religion and spiritual influences could be made more effective.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step was to dignify worship and daily prayer, by making them not a matter of compulsion but of privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/><pb id="p.163" n="163"/> That they should be so considered by the students, great pains were taken to make them more attractive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>A fine choir of men and boys and a more congregational form of worship were features in the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>But the great step that the university made was in calling to her service some of the strongest men in the ministry, who were led to devote a few weeks in each year to the spiritual interests of the students.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>Before this plan had been matured <persName n="Brooks,Doctor,Phillips,,," id="n0185.0020.00163.00657" reg="default:Brooks,Phillips,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Phillips</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> had been invited to be the chaplain of the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>He declined, fortunately; for the larger and more effective plan, by which he with others could place some of their life at the service of the college, was now developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>In this he was always a most interested and sympathetic adviser of the president, whose object was to make the <rs>Christian</rs> religion a dignified, natural, and effective force in the new life of the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>The influence which he brought to bear in favor of the new plan was most potent in causing its adoption.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>An adaptation of the <rs>English</rs> cathedral system of canons in residence was devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/><num value="6">Six</num> preachers to the university were appointed, <num value="1">one</num> of them, <persName n="Peabody,Professor,F.,G.,," id="n0185.0020.00163.00658" reg="expanded:Peabody,Francis,Greenwood,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>Peabody</surname></persName>, being a permanent teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>During the <measure n="36weeks" type="date">thirty-six weeks</measure> of term-time each preacher became responsible for the services and prayers for <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>The practical result is this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>At <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> before <num value="9">nine</num> every morning a body of students who wish to open the day with common prayer in company with their fellows meet in <placeName reg="Appleton Chapel">Appleton Chapel</placeName>, and the preacher in residence leads them in prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>In reviewing the material growth and prosperity of a city it is well to consider some of the factors that have contributed to its renown in the best sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>Although an aggregation of houses and buildings inhabited by a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> people may constitute a city, and it may be rated in prosperity in proportion to its increase in buildings and population, and its growth in wealth and industries&mdash;may we not look for higher evidences of its comparative rank in its development of principles and men?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>Now that our cities are rapidly becoming like so many furnaces where human lives are consumed like coal to meet the demands of our civilization, the question of how to conserve life and add to its capacity for health and enjoyment is rapidly growing in importance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>The effects of a sedentary life, and the close confinement necessarily accompanying the intellectual efforts of the students, must have drawn the attention of the college authorities to the matter of health preservation at an early period in its history, although we have no record of any practical effort in this direction until the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quarter of the present century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/>It is interesting to observe that whatever efforts are made by the college towards the maintenance of health must necessarily be supplemented by the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>The college can teach the elements of hygiene and correct methods of living, and the individual may apply these precepts to his own life, but so long as the physical <pb id="p.165" n="165"/> man is ultimately the product of the air he breathes, the food he eats, and the water he drinks, his immediate environments must play an important part in his health and development.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>In this respect, a man who undertakes to build himself up mentally or physically becomes for the time being simply an agent of distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>That is, by bringing his mental faculties into increased activity he can send nutriment to his brain, or by using his muscles vigorously he can send nutriment to different parts of his body, in this way building up and elaborating material substances into the highest kind of organic faculty.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>But the nature of these material substances and the condition in which they are brought to him are often beyond his individual control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>Thus the condition of the soil, the source and nature of the food and drinking water, the presence of stagnant pools and nuisances in the neighborhood, the overgrowth of trees, the prevalence of dust, the state of the sewerage and of the streets, drains, and rivers, are all matters which affect individual health, but unfortunately are matters over which the individual oftentimes can have but little influence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>Here it is that men acting collectively or as a municipality may effect changes and improvements for the common good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>As the individual suffers or prospers in consequence of his environment, so the city prospers or deteriorates as it becomes attractive or otherwise to the individual as a place of residence or a place of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>Thus it might be maintained that in health matters, as they affect individuals, institutions, or the public, the interest of the college and the city are reciprocal if not identical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>Let us note, therefore, the progress which the college and the city have made in these matters during the past century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>In this review I shall confine myself principally to the health agencies brought into popular service through what is ordinarily termed physical training.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>In the next decade, beginning <dateStruct value="1870--"><year reg="1870">1870</year></dateStruct>, several more college gymnasiums were built, including the <rs>Hemenway Gymnasium</rs> at <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>The Harvard Athletic Association was established in <dateStruct value="1874--"><year reg="1874">1874</year></dateStruct>, and the <name>Rugby</name> football game, which seems to have such a hold upon the <rs>American</rs> public, was introduced at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> at about this time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>With the completion of the <rs>Hemenway Gymnasium</rs>, and its equipment with a new system of apparatus, a new era was introduced in gymnasium construction and in gymnasium methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>Some of the features which made the <rs>Hemenway Gymnasium</rs> unique at the time of its opening may be briefly stated: It was the largest gymnasium in point of floor-room, air space, and the number of its dressing-rooms, lockers, and pieces of apparatus then in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>The recent addition given to the university by <persName n="Hemenway,Mister,,,," id="n0185.0021.00168.00673" reg="nearbymention:Hemenway,Augustus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hemenway</surname></persName> has placed the <rs>Harvard Gymnasium</rs> again at the head of the list in all of these particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>The <rs>Hemenway</rs> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gymnasium in the country to have special rooms devoted to rowing, baseball, fencing, sparring, trophies, records, photographing, examinations, etc.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/>In the old-style gymnasium it was necessary for the man to adapt himself to the apparatus; in the new-style gymnasium, the apparatus is adapted to the man. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the apparatus was heavy and cumbersome, and the man was obliged to lift his own weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>In his efforts to do so he was frequently overworked and exhausted, as previously stated by <persName n="Jarvis,Doctor,,,," id="n0185.0021.00168.00674" reg="nearbymention:Jarvis,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Jarvis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>Now most of the apparatus is attached to a weight that he can lift, and this is easily adjusted to the strength of the strong and the weakness of the weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Formerly, in using the gymnasium, a young man was forced to enter into competition with others in <pb id="p.169" n="169"/> the performance of difficult feats; now he can avoid the heavy apparatus if he desires to, and enter into competition with himself; that is, with his own condition from time to time, as determined by physical examinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/>The old gymnasium was necessarily restricted to the few on account of the limited nature of its equipment; the modern system of apparatus and developing appliances has opened up the possibilities of the gymnasium to everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>Formerly, any kind of material, put together in any way, was thought good enough to <q direct="unspecified">make things for boys to play with;</q> now, the best material on the market is selected for gymnastic and athletic goods, and the best mechanical skill in the country is engaged in the construction of athletic appliances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>When the history of the rise and spread of the interest in physical exercise is written, it will be surprising to many to know how much of this interest may be attributed to the genius of the inventor, and the skill of the artificer and mechanic.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>The introduction of the new apparatus at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> made also a new era in the method or system employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>Whereas in many institutions attendance upon gymnasium exercises is required by classes, at <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> the attendance is voluntary, and the system adopted is <num value="1">one</num> designed to meet the special wants of each individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Realizing the great diversity in age, size, and strength, as well as in health, of the students who attend the university, the director makes no attempt to group them into classes which pursue the same course of exercises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>Upon entering the university, each student is entitled to a physical examination by the director, in which his bodily proportions are measured, his strength tested, his heart and lungs examined, and information solicited concerning his health and inherited tendencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>From the data thus procured a special order of appropriate exercises is made out for each student, with specifications of the movements and apparatus which he may best use. These exercises are marked in outline on cards without charge, or in handbooks accompanied by charts at a small expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>After working on this prescription for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, the student is entitled to another examination, by which the results of the work are ascertained, and the director enabled to make a further prescription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>Students holding scholarships are expected to be examined twice a year, and those desiring to enter athletic contests are required to be examined by the director, and obtain his permission so to do. In <pb id="p.170" n="170"/> addition to the individual prescriptions, there are classes in free movements and light gymnastics, designed to afford an opportunity for general development to all students of the university who are not members of the athletic teams, or who are not in need of specially prescribed exercises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/>All students desiring to enter as competitors in athletic contests are required to give evidence of their ability by making a series of strength tests, in addition to the regular physical examinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>Under this regime the attendance at the gymnasium has grown from about <num value="500">500</num> in <dateStruct value="1880--"><year reg="1880">1880</year></dateStruct> to <num value="2000">2000</num> and over in <dateStruct value="1896--"><year reg="1896">1896</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>Perhaps the most radical difference between the old and new <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> may be illustrated by the position the authorities have taken since <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct> in regard to athletic sports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1915"/>In the later sixties, and all through the seventies, the athletic zeal and energies of the students were concentrated upon the production of a successful baseball <num value="9">nine</num> and a winning boat crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1916"/>Given other institutions fired with the same ambition and equally persistent, it was only a question of time when the efforts in this direction would be carried to excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1917"/>The <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> faculty concluded that its students had reached this stage in <dateStruct value="1882--"><year reg="1882">1882</year></dateStruct>, and appointed a committee to regulate and control athletic sports in the university.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1918"/>The work and policy of this committee is too familiar to the <rs>Cambridge</rs> public to call for any comment here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1919"/>In the mean time, another phase of the athletic problem has presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1920"/>While some institutions seem much concerned as to what their students are doing for athletics, the authorities of <orgName n="Harvard University" type="university">Harvard University</orgName> are more desirous of knowing what athletics are doing for their students.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1921"/>In other words, the growing disparity between the number of athletic teams and the increasing number of students is becoming more marked every year, and efforts are being made to extend the athletic facilities of the university so that larger numbers of students can enjoy the advantages of practicing out-door exercises.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1922"/>Through the munificence of <persName n="Hemenway,Mister,Augustus,,," id="n0185.0021.00170.00675" reg="default:Hemenway,Augustus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Augustus</foreName> <surname>Hemenway</surname></persName>, <persName n="Higginson,Colonel,H.,L.,," id="n0185.0021.00170.00676" reg="expanded:Higginson,Henry,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Higginson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Weld,Mister,G.,W.,," id="n0185.0021.00170.00677" reg="default:Weld,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Weld</surname></persName>, and a few other graduates, the general plant for exercise, physical training, and athletic sports has been greatly augmented within the past few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1923"/>It is doubtful if any institution in the world can surpass the facilities of <placeName reg="Harvard Station, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2379301">Harvard</placeName> in this <orgName n="Education Department" type="department">department of education</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1924"/>But how has <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> been affected by this revival of interest in physical training?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1925"/>some of my readers may ask. The <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> Y. M. C.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1926"/>Although this new movement in gymnasium construction and equipment got its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> footing in <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, no manufacturer in the city had faith enough in the future growth and demands for gymnasium supplies to embark in it as a business enterprise, though there are several companies in different parts of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> making this new style of apparatus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1927"/>We shall not attempt to describe the extent to which this new movement in physical education has spread, the number of persons reached, nor the amount of money expended in land, buildings, and equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1928"/>We know that gymnasiums and athletic clubs have arisen by the hundreds all over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1929"/>Some of the most expensive of the gymnasiums have cost over <measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">two hundred thousand dollars</measure>, and <num value="1">one</num> of the athletic associations in New York has property valued at little less than a <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1930"/>Some idea of the growth of interest in physical development in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the special directions it is taking may be inferred from the following lists of gymnasiums that have been built, reconstructed, or equipped, to the writer's knowledge, since the <rs>World</rs>'s Fair in <dateStruct value="1893--"><year reg="1893">1893</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1931"/>The past <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> may fairly be said to represent the era of gymnasium construction, and the next few years will witness a marked improvement in gymnasium intructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1932"/><pb id="p.172" n="172"/></p> 
<p>It is natural that individuals desiring to acquaint themselves more fully with the <rs>Harvard</rs> methods of physical training should be attracted to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> as the centre from which the new movement has largely radiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1933"/><orgName type="college" n="Harvard college">Harvard</orgName> began to feel the demand for instructors in this branch of education soon after the completion of the <rs>Hemenway Gymnasium</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>Since <dateStruct value="1887--"><year reg="1887">1887</year></dateStruct> there has been a considerable number of teachers from all parts of the country who have repaired to <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> during the summer months to study and practice the methods of physical training taught at the <rs type="place">Harvard Summer School</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>In this department alone we have had since the school opened <num value="584">584</num> different pupils, <num value="206">206</num> of whom were men, and <num value="378">378</num> women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1942"/>Thus it will be seen that <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> as the seat of the great university is not only building up hardy and vigorous bodies for its regular students, but through its courses for teachers is helping to advance the cause of physical education throughout the land.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1943"/>The athletic organizations of the university have undoubtedly exerted a great influence over the youth of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1944"/>The regularity of living while in training for the great games and contests, the daily regime as to diet, sleep, bathing, etc., and the voluntary discipline under which the students place themselves in order to reach the coveted goal, are all great moral lessons in their way, and lessons which the boy often accepts <pb id="p.173" n="173"/> from his hero in the field rather than from his <orgName n="Sunday School" type="school">Sunday-school</orgName> teacher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1945"/>The stimulus afforded by the athletic life of the students is felt by all classes of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> people, from the boy who crawls under the fence to see a game to the merchant prince who fills a palace car with his friends, and takes them a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> to see a similar exhibition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/></p> 
<p>Women seeking opportunities for the higher education naturally prefer to find them at an institution which is allied at least with <num value="1">one</num> established and carried on for men, because they think that there they will be in the line of progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>They feel that on the perfecting of methods and the best application of educational forces the entire body of instructors in such an institution, as well as in all others like it, is united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>Present them a course of instruction different from that offered to men, and they do not eye it askance because they think it not so good, but because it is probably just out of the line upon which progress and improvement are to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the reasons why thoughtful women have less confidence in courses of instruction specially prepared for them than they have in that <num value="1">one</num> upon which the wisdom of men has for generations been working, and is still working.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>It is not, therefore, because the present opportunities and courses of study of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> are thought the best that can be devised for women, that women come in increasing numbers to share them, but because in their estimation they represent the highest stage of present educational progress in our land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2589"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who has observed the trend of industrial and social progress doubts that the prevailing forms of education are inadequate to the needs of many boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2590"/>The founder of the <rs type="place">Cambridge Manual Training School</rs> has provided the means of testing, under most favorable circumstances, the educational value of training based upon the mechanic arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2591"/>Every improvement in equipment and in methods of instruction suggested by nearly <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> experience has been made, and the school is now fully prepared to do the work for which it was established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2592"/>In order to provide for the future needs of the youth of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, for whose benefit the school was primarily established, it has been equipped on a scale of liberality which makes it, for the <pb id="p.226" n="226"/> present, possible to accommodate a considerable number of nonresident pupils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2593"/>The loyalty of its students, and the favorable impression already made by its graduates, are encouraging evidences of its success.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2594"/>The training that the boys receive is broad, and, above all, practical,&mdash;a training calculated to make good workmen, good citizens, and good men. Its scope covers all branches of the mechanic arts, including carpentry and joinery, blacksmithing, wood-turning, and pattern-making, iron-fitting, machine-shop practice, and mechanical drawing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2595"/>No claim is made, however, that the school teaches a trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2596"/>Did it do so, it would not be an educational institution of the high order which it is in the minds of educators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2597"/>In no sense is it a trade school, but rather a school in which the whole man is educated, the hand and the mind, and the mind more broadly than would be possible without the education of the hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2598"/>The training given emphasizes strongly the academic side of the work, and strives to make that work more interesting and effective by bringing it into intimate relation with practical applications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2599"/>The school is peculiarly adapted to the needs of boys who have little aptitude for abstract study, but who wish to prepare themselves for employment in which mechanical skill and an intelligent appreciation of the principles which underlie the processes employed are essentials of success.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2600"/>It is confidently believed, too, that the school offers unsurpassed advantages to boys who desire to prepare for the <orgName n="Lawrence Scientific School" type="school">Lawrence Scientific School</orgName>, the <orgName n="Technology Massachusetts Institute" type="institute">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</orgName>, or any similar institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2601"/>The manual dexterity and the thorough knowledge of tools, machinery, and mechanical processes acquired in the shops, at an age when time can be most easily spared for such training, is of great value in any scientific pursuit.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2602"/>But the branches of manual and mental science taught do not compose the whole of a boy's education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2603"/>The thoughtful man questions methods used, habits inculcated, and standards adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2604"/>Here, too, we have only to look to the boys for an answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2605"/>Their gentlemanly manner, self-control, industry, and personal neatness, all testify to the wholesome and stimulating influences which only the discipline and direction of courteous, methodical, and skillful instructors can produce.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2606"/>Besides the reputation which its educational prestige has <pb id="p.227" n="227"/> given it, our school has developed features which are calculated to attract popular interest and support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2607"/>The most interesting of these is the unique fire drill, an application of the methods of extinguishing and preventing fire, ingeniously fitted to the uses of a school drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2608"/>The boys, during drill times, hold themselves ready for an alarm, which may come when they least expect it, just as it would happen in ordinary practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2609"/>They lay lines of hose, raise ladders, and use life-saving apparatus with skill and speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2610"/>Discipline is maintained by frequent military drills, which also afford practice in the management and handling of bodies of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2612"/>A part of this time is taken from that assigned to shop work, but somewhat more than half of it is required in addition to the regular school hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2613"/>Presence of mind in emergencies is a marked result of fire drill, as well as the development of the finer qualities of respect to superiors, obedience, courage, and tact in managing others.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2715"/>Yet a few things which have marked its past may be repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2716"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting-house was not an imposing building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2717"/>We have no plan of it. But the meeting-house in <placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 6" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">Boston</placeName> had mud walls and a thatched roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2718"/>This was, we may suppose, very much like that in character, though it was probably built of logs, and in accordance with the law the roof was <q direct="unspecified">covered with slate or board.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2719"/>The chimney could not be made of wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2720"/>Thus early were they taking precaution against fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2721"/>This house was small and plain, especially if compared with the stately parish churches of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2722"/>But it had a rare dignity from the presence of <persName n="Hooker,,Thomas,,," id="n0185.0028.00234.01052" reg="default:Hooker,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shepard,,Thomas,,," id="n0185.0028.00234.01053" reg="default:Shepard,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Shepard</surname></persName>, and the earnest exiles who were with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2723"/>The people of the town were required to come to the meeting-house <pb id="p.235" n="235"/> on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Monday of every month within half an hour after the ringing of the bell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2724"/>This would indicate that there was a bell on the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2725"/>But when <persName n="Johnson,,Edward,,," id="n0185.0028.00235.01054" reg="default:Johnson,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> was here in <dateStruct value="1636--"><year reg="1636">1636</year></dateStruct>, he wandered out from <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> till he came to a large plain, where he heard a drum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2726"/>He asked a man whom he met what the drum was for, and was told it was to call people to the meeting-house where <persName n="Shepard,Mister,,,," id="n0185.0028.00235.01055" reg="nearbymention:Shepard,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Shepard</surname></persName> preached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2727"/>He found his way to the place, and was so deeply impressed that he resolved to live and die with the ministers of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2728"/>The town and church acquired special prominence when in the same year in which the church was formed the <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName> agreed to give <measure n="400l." type="pounds"><num value="400">four hundred</num> pounds</measure>, equal to a year's rate of the whole colony, a grant of <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> from each of the <num value="4000">four thousand</num> inhabitants, towards a school or college.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2729"/>The next year it was ordered that the college should be here, and in <dateStruct value="1638--"><year reg="1638">1638</year></dateStruct> the college was opened, and <placeName reg="Newtown, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2540672">Newtown</placeName> became <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2730"/>The college was founded here because this was a pleasant and convenient place, and the town was <q direct="unspecified">under the orthodox and soulflourish-ing ministry of <persName n="Shepheard,Mister,Thomas,,," id="n0185.0028.00235.01056" reg="default:Shepheard,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Shepheard</surname></persName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2731"/>The college was meant to serve the churches, and to give them a learned ministry when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ministers should lie in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2732"/>The ministers of the church had a constant influence in shaping the life of the college; and the presence of the college, with its teachers and students, conferred a rare distinction, which has remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>A very exciting and important matter in the colony was the arrival of <persName n="Hutchinson,Mrs.,Anne,,," id="n0185.0028.00235.01057" reg="default:Hutchinson,Anne,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName> <surname>Hutchinson</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="1634--"><year reg="1634">1634</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>She soon declared some peculiar views, which were deemed erroneous and hurtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2735"/>Then came a fierce dissension, and the colony was in dire peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3159"/>It must be allowed that active philanthropy forms a prominent trait in the character of the present day. At no former period has there been such extensive and effectual provision, both public and private, for the relief of the poor and infirm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3161"/>These advantages, however, must be limited in great measure to the particular town in which such institution is founded, hence it becomes important that there should be formed in every town an institution for extending the blessings of charity to the necessitous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>The society continues its career of usefulness in a manner but slightly different from that laid down by the founders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>It collects annually a certain sum, which is distributed by its almoner to the destitute with great carefulness, and the original principles of charitableness and thorough investigation of every case are followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>Among societies of its kind, it is doubtless the most venerable in our city.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>It is entertaining, as showing the expression of the feelings of beneficence on the part of the fathers, in the village days of <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, to look over the records of the society to mark on what subjects the thoughts of the members were brought to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>For example, in <dateStruct value="1816--"><year reg="1816">1816</year></dateStruct> they began to see the necessity for more apparatus for the performance of its work, and it was voted that an inquiry should be made by the trustees <q direct="unspecified">concerning a patent bedstead and the machinery pertaining to it, for the purpose of raising a sick person from a bed,</q> and they were prudently authorized to <q direct="unspecified">procure such a <num value="1">one</num> as in their discretion may comport with the pecuniary means of the <name>Society</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>In the same year steps were taken to provide, <q direct="unspecified">at the expense of the town,</q> a <q direct="unspecified">suitable boat or boats, and apparatus belonging <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> thereto, to be kept and used for finding, as soon as may be, persons drowned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>The boat continued to demand a portion of the attention of the society at its meetings until <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, after which date&mdash;<measure n="14years" type="date">fourteen years</measure> from its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance&mdash;it disappears from the records.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>It had been found in <dateStruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></dateStruct> that the town was not willing to pay the entire cost of the boat, and it was voted that <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Hilliard,,William,,," id="n0185.0035.00271.01400" reg="default:Hilliard,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Hilliard</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, and Cap'n <persName n="Child,,Samuel,,," id="n0185.0035.00271.01401" reg="default:Child,Samuel,,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Child</surname></persName> be a committee to procure a suitable boat and appendages to the same,</q> with authority to <q direct="unspecified">draw upon the <rs>Treasurer</rs> for such sum as may be necessary, in addition to the sum provided by the <rs>Selectmen</rs>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>In <dateStruct value="1818-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1818">1818</year></dateStruct>, this committee reported that the object had been accomplished by means of contributions of <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure> each from the town and <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>, and certain additional sums from those benevolent personages, <q direct="unspecified">individuals of the town.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>Thus, after <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of negotiation, the boat had been prepared for its work of <q direct="unspecified">finding, as soon as may be, persons drowned.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>By <dateStruct value="1825--"><year reg="1825">1825</year></dateStruct>, however, after <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> of usefulness, as we must suppose, it was discovered that <q direct="unspecified">the boat</q> needed repairs, and the trustees were requested to put it in order <q direct="unspecified">as soon as may be, and to keep it in order, and place it in such situation as shall be safe and convenient of access when there may be occasion to use it in the service of the <name>Society</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>A year later the trustees made a report on the expediency of repairing the boat, and we can only guess that they had discovered that its condition had placed it beyond the desirability of repairs, for the society, after adjourning for a month, perhaps in order that the members might make personal examination of the boat, voted to appropriate <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> for an entirely new <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>It was not so easy, however, to provide suitable care for the boat, and in <dateStruct value="1829-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1829">1829</year></dateStruct>, a committee of <num value="3">three</num> prominent citizens was appointed to provide the quarters, which seem still to be unsecured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>This committee reported that the best method would be to contract with <persName n="Willard,Mister,Emery,,," id="n0185.0035.00271.01402" reg="default:Willard,Emery,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Emery</foreName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName> to care for the boat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>The advice of the committee was adopted, and the boat seems thereafter to have been kept by <persName n="Willard,Mister,,,," id="n0185.0035.00271.01403" reg="nearbymention:Willard,Emery,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/><pb id="p.272" n="272"/></p> 
<p>The society had been formed to aid the <q direct="unspecified">indigent sick,</q> and after about <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> of experience, in <dateStruct value="1823--"><year reg="1823">1823</year></dateStruct>, a feeling arose that perhaps the sphere of action might be widened, and accordingly a committee was appointed to <q direct="unspecified">enquire whether any portion of the <rs>Society</rs>'s funds may be appropriated to the use of other persons besides the indigent sick.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>This committee made a formal report on this, which seemed to be a constitutional question, in the course of which it said:&mdash; <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/></p> 
<p>That upon the organization of the <name>Society</name>, it was considered a primary object to obtain such articles, by way of permanent apparatus, as are wanted in cases of sickness, and which with difficulty are procured from other sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/>To the accomplishment of this object, liberal subscriptions were then made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>In addition to this, the annual assessment of <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> upon each member of the <name>Society</name> has enabled it, from year to year, to make appropriations for the partial relief of such cases of poverty, accompanied with sickness, as have come within the knowledge of the <name>Trustees</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>Your Committee would further report, that although it was considered a prudent measure in the infant state of the <name>Society</name>, to limit its appropriations for relief exclusively to the objects contemplated in the <name>Preamble</name> to the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <name>Society</name>, to wit, <quote>the indigent sick;</quote> yet they consider that there are many strong cases, which have and will occur, where the restriction operates as a bar against the relief of suffering poverty, although not attended with the still greater calamity of sickness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>In such cases your Committee are of the opinion that the prudent extension of our charities might be made to comport with the benevolent intentions of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>From these considerations your Committee would recommend, that the <rs>Constitution</rs> be so far altered, that the appropriations hereafter made by the <name>Society</name> be applied to such persons as the <name>Society</name>, or the <name>Trustees</name> thereof, may consider as in a state of suffering poverty, although it may not be accompanied with actual sickness.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>The society was not in a hurry, even as late as <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, and it was <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> a year before the committee made its report, and then, on the strength of it, a vote was passed authorizing the treasurer to pay to <persName n="King,,George,,," id="n0185.0035.00273.01405" reg="default:King,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>King</surname></persName> <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure>, <q direct="unspecified">whenever said <rs type="role2">King</rs> has erected a convenient bathing-house adjoining to or near the old <placeName reg="Brighton Bridge">Brighton Bridge</placeName>, so-called.</q>
