<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>A brief description may be in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The piano itself, <hi rend="italics">i.e</hi>., the frame, strings and keyboard, is enclosed in a rectangular box about <measure n="1260squareinches" type="area"><measure n="21feet" type="distance">twenty-one</measure> by <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty inches</measure></measure>, about <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This box has metallic drop handles at each end, such as are used on tool-boxes for carrying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This box or case of veneered wood rests upon a frame slightly larger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This frame consists of <num value="4">four</num> boards about <measure n="10inches" type="distance">ten inches</measure> wide tenoned into the square legs at each corner, the front faces of which are fluted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>From these flutings downward to the brass casters they are elaborately turned, and the principal member of the pattern reeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The front-board of this frame is cut in the form of an elliptic arch, and behind it is placed another, plain and straight, and back of this is the bellows above referred to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>This <hi rend="italics">frame</hi> is evidently no part of the original construction by <persName n="Ganer,,Christopher,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00046" reg="default:Ganer,Christopher,,,"><foreName>Christopher</foreName> <surname>Ganer</surname></persName>, but must have been the work of some <orgName n="American Artisan" type="newspaper">American artisan</orgName> of later years.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In some other rooms there, are other of those exhibits, and the managers regret the lack of a suitable hall for their grouping in general display for examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Our inspection of this old instrument was with some disadvantage, as the rooms are almost continuously in use by students, but here is what, by lying on our backs on the floor and gazing upward, we found:&mdash;</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Some of these pipes are made at right angles (instead of straight) because of the limited space, and all are placed <hi rend="italics">horizontally</hi>, instead of the usual vertical position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/><num value="4">Four</num> of these are gone from their place, but with the disjointed blow-pedal are stored away in the <hi rend="italics">old</hi> piano case, under the cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="2">Two</num> of them are broken apart at the angle; the other <num value="2">two</num> are intact and responded to our breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/><num value="1">One</num> of the music teachers expressed his surprise thus, <q direct="unspecified">Why, this isn't a piano at all, it's an organ!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Here the query arises,&mdash;when did it cease to be a piano?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>as it certainly did when the strings were removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>So, in search of information, we went to the <name>Chickerings</name>.</p>

<head>A nation's Memorial Day.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We are recognizing Memorial Day this year as being more significant than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is different from the other national holidays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>No noise of guns and exciting fireworks, no demand for a safe and sane Memorial Day, but the emphasis is on reverence, honor and respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The men and boys of the sixties have been honored through all the years on this day. And in recent years tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of new dead have been added to the lists, making the day more meaningful than ever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We have new reasons for observing Memorial Day. The old veterans, to whom the day has always meant so much, have been passing away rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The day was being given over increasingly to sports and diversions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But the new sacrifices on the fields of battle for the country have brought our people to a rededication of the day. No longer do we leave the loving task to the brave survivors of the <rs>Civil War</rs>. We still follow the <rs>Grand Army</rs> in the work of decorating the graves of our dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But we see it now as a common privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>This present generation with honor and reverence remembers those who have perished honorably for the sake of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The day with its duties is essentially patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>A higher appreciation of country must follow a fitting remembrance of the price paid in blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Such a remembrance is vital for us who remain to carry on. The heart of the nation is softened, and sympathy and unselfishness are promoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>In such a spirit we can be thoughtful in our observance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We cannot think of it as a day of revelry and frolic in those <num value="1000">thousands</num> of homes where <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> there are vacant places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Nor can we believe that those who survived the tempests of battle will be anxious for mere pleasure on that day. It is a Holy Day, when we keep green the memory of those <q direct="unspecified">whose tents on fame's eternal camping ground are spread,</q> when we try to get into fellowship with the spirit that made those men and women heroes and patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Our civil liberty will never be safe if we forget them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Memorial Day has a forward look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We cannot consider those who stood and fought victoriously without considering their successors through the years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The immortal <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> speech voices this thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>There is an unfinished work, to which we must dedicate ourselves, and <q direct="unspecified">from these honored dead we must take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>That is the spirit in which we should observe Memorial Day. Proud as we are of our huge populations, our increasing wealth, our magnificent cities, our intellectual and scientific achievements, we must remember that if the nation is not bound together with a sincere piety she will perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Memorial Day appeals to us for the development of all that is pure and good.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> next we are challenged to prove ourselves as patriots who are worthy of the huge sacrifices made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We venture to say that the dead would, if they could, tell us that they died for a great cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>They did not die that we might permit liberty to degenerate into license, that we might indulge in class hatred, racial hatred, and forget the surging passion for American unity which impelled them to meet death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>They did not die that we might live in riotous extravagance and mad pleasure, neglectful of the multitudes in sorrow and want at our doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>They did not die that we might develop laziness in our industries, neglect of worship, irreverence for the flag, and various red orgies of disloyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If on Memorial Day we stand reverently before the tomb of him who died at <placeName reg="Schuylerville, Saratoga, New York" key="tgn,7014490">Saratoga</placeName> or St. Mihiel, or <pb id="p.25" n="25"/> <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> or in the <name>Argonne</name>, and in humility think of the sacrifice and ask why it was made, the answer will write itself on our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>We want to commemorate the day, so that its message of present duty, its call to homage, its promise of immortality, may lead us into a higher type of patriotism for the sake of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and country.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The young people of each household are there listed according to occupation, and older women <q direct="unspecified">at home.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>To the names of some elderly men residing with a son the former occupation is given, and in some cases as <q direct="unspecified">retired.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>There were probably <num value="1000">1,000</num> copies printed, and the month that intervened between the close of the fiscal year and the warning of town meeting sufficed for the making up of reports, printing and delivery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The <q direct="unspecified">oppressed laborers</q> of that time worked <measure n="10hours" type="date">ten hours</measure> daily, <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> in a week, and the business men, their employers, probably more hours, but both classes found time to inform themselves, for the government was then <q direct="unspecified">in the hands of the many,</q> and the voters were the appropriating power.</p>
