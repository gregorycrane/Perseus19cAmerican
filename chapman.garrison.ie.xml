<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I once knew a man who wrote a brilliant biography of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n0158.0001.00006.00011" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He himself belonged to the <rs>Civil War</rs> epoch, and while writing the book in about the year <dateStruct value="1895--"><year reg="1895">1895</year></dateStruct>, he became so absorbed and excited by that war as he studied it, and lived it over again, that he could not sleep at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He paced the room, lost in thought, awed by his subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It was a contemporary of this biographer who told me that, while the <rs>Civil War</rs> was in progress, the enthusiastic historian had taken no interest in it; it did n't seem to attract his attention.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This anecdote shows how much easier it is to see a hero in the past than in the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The historian is a book-trained man; records and documents speak to him; dead things live again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But he cannot get his mind into focus upon anything so near as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He is distracted by the present, but supported by the past; for in the past he is not alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As he studies it, the whole literature of his chosen period holds up hip hands: hundreds of minds rush to his aid, while all religion and philosophy stand at his elbow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><pb id="p.-007" n="-007"/></p> 
<p>It is easy to explain why <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00007.00012" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> has never been adopted as a popular hero in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He gave a purge to his countrymen, and the bitter taste of it remained in our mouths ever after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Moreover, the odium of Slavery, which he branded on <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>'s brow, seemed to survive in the very name of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00007.00013" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, and we would willingly have forgotten the man. After the <rs>Civil War</rs> there was not, apparently, time for our scholars to think about him. Certain it is that the educated <rs>American</rs> has known little about him, and shies and mutters at his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>And yet equally certain is it that the history of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> between <dateStruct value="1800--"><year reg="1800">1800</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> will some day be rewritten with this man as its central figure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>How soon will that day come, and what will be the signs of its dawning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The laws of mind and nature are not likely to be reversed to save the feelings and prejudices of the <rs>American</rs> people, a people who are not given to historic speculation and who have been mentally enfeebled by success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is not for <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00007.00014" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> that I am concerned, but for a people that praises the prophets, builds altars to courage, enshrines the idea of the <rs>Individual Soul</rs>; but a people, it would seem, who cannot see a real man when he appears, because he makes them uncomfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00007.00015" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> made his compatriots <pb id="p.-008" n="-008"/> uncomfortable; even to read about him made them uncomfortable but yesterday.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>In reprinting this little book, the thought crosses my mind that perhaps the shock and anguish of the <name>Great War</name>, which so humanized our nation, may have left us with a keener, more religious, and more dramatic understanding of our Anti-slavery period than we possessed prior to <dateStruct value="1914--"><year reg="1914">1914</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Certainly when this book appeared in <dateStruct value="1913--"><year reg="1913">1913</year></dateStruct>, the average <rs>American</rs> seemed to hear the name of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00008.00016" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> with distaste, and to regard a book about him as superfluous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>While I was writing it, <num value="1">one</num> of my best friends, and a very learned gentleman, said to me, <quote>A book about <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0158.0001.00008.00017" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Heave a brick at him for me!</quote> --and the popular feeling in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> of that day seemed to support the remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But the times have changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The flames of the <name>Great War</name> have passed through us. The successive shocks of that experience struck upon our people till we resounded in unison like a great bell; and there is not a soul among us that has not been shaken to its depths.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The heroic echoes of the terrible struggle have died away and left all the nations dizzy and defocalized, worn out by effort and emotion, and, apparently, more cynical and bent on petty aims than they were before the <pb id="p.-009" n="-009"/> ordeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But this tidal revulsion is in the way of Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>She acts by waves and inundations, by recessions, mud-flats, and desolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It appears just now as if all the tin cans and dead dogs of humanity were exposed to view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Nevertheless, the tides will surge in once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The devastated regions will be reclaimed and reanimated &mdash; in spots, of course, and irregularly as is Nature's wont.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The great, heroic impulse of that war is not really lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It lies invisibly planted in our hearts, and especially in the hearts of the younger generation, who will never know from how many old shibboleths and cramping views they have been liberated by having taken part in something that was universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our own past will assume fresh aspects in our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00009.00018" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> will come to see their own history in a more normal perspective than they did formerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The fog of self-consciousness that has hung above our Anti-slavery period will be dissipated in the minds of our historians, and we shall see <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00009.00019" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> as <num value="1">one</num> of our greatest heroes &mdash; a man born to a task as large as his country's destiny, who turned the tide of his age, and left an imprint of his mind and character upon us, as certain and as visible as the imprint left upon us by <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0158.0001.00009.00020" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> himself.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The periods of history that are most interesting are those which have been lighted up by spiritual bonfires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>As we read about such epochs we seem to feel the fires rekindling in our bosoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Through the identity of those historic flames with our own, we become aware of our portion in the past, and of our mission in the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The names of the actors, to be sure, are changed; the names of the forces at work vary continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Yet the substance of the story is ever the same; the fable deals with ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>And therefore that fable stirs the intimate embers in us. Here, within us, are those smothered and banked furnaces which the stride of History has left behind it-the only now living part, the only real part and absolute remnant of the divine pageant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>There are some periods of great conflagration <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> where a whole epoch is lighted up with <num value="1">one</num> great flame of idea, which takes perhaps a few decades to arise, blaze, and fall; during which time it shows all men in its glare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Willy-nilly they can be and are seen by this light and by no other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Willynilly their chief interest for the future lies in their relation to this idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In spite of themselves they are thrilling, illustrative figures, seen in lurid and logical distortion, --abstracts and epitomes of human life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Nay, they stand forever as creatures that have been caught and held, cracked open, thrown living upon a screen, burned alive perhaps by a searching and terrible bonfire and recorded in the act as the citizens of <placeName reg="Pompeii, Napoli, Campania" key="tgn,7004658">Pompeii</placeName> were recorded by the eruption of <placeName reg="Mount Vesuvius, Meagher, Montana" key="tgn,2744496">Mount Vesuvius</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It happened that a period of this kind passed over the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> between the years <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>There is nothing to be found in that epoch which does not draw its significance, its interest, its permanent power from the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>There is no man whose life falls within that epoch whose character was not controlled by that question, or whose portrait can be seen by any other light than the light of that fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Subtract that light and you have darkness; <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> you cannot see the man at all. In the biographies of certain distinguished conservatives of that time you may often observe the softening of the portrait by the omission of unpleasant records, the omission by the biographers of those test judgments and test ordeals with which the times were well supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>By these omissions the man vanishes from the page of his own book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The page grows suddenly blank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>You check yourself and wonder who it was that you were reading about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Now the reason of this disappearance of the leading character from your mind is that the biographer has drawn someone who <hi rend="italics">could</hi> not have existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The man must have answered aye or nay to the question which the times were putting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>And, in fact, he did so answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>By this answer he could have been seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>There was never a moment during this time when the slavery issue was not a sleeping serpent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Thereafter slavery was always in everyone's <hi rend="italics">mind</hi>, though not always on his tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>A slave state and a free state were, as a matter of practice, always admitted in pairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>This was to preserve the balance of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The whole country, however, was in a state of unstable equilibrium and <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> the era of good feeling oscillated upon the top of a craggy peak.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>This compromise became, in the public mind, as sacred as the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself; so that when, in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>, the <name>Compromise</name> was repealed, the whole <rs>North</rs> felt that the bottom had dropped out of their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>At the bottom of this nervous concern there was not, as is generally supposed, merely the bumptious pride and ignorance of a new nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Any person who reviews the history of the <rs>American Revolution</rs> can sympathize with this timidity; for it seems like a miracle that the <name>Colonies</name> should ever have come together-so antagonistic were their interests, and their ideals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The Colonists feared some new breach, and there ensued a non-intellectual determination that certain questions should not be re-examined: this determination <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> gradually grew into our great stupefying dogma which says to the private citizen, <quote>This is our way of doing things: youbedamned: intellect has nothing to do with the matter: it is American.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>This dogma, which arose out of the needs of our early days, has become the most widespread form of metaphysical faith among us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It is the great paving-stone of conclusive demonstration, placed upon the mouth of a natural spring.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>All this while something had been left out in all the nation's political and social philosophy &mdash; something which policy forbade men to search for, and this something was beginning to move in the pit of the stomach of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0158.0003.00014.00042" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>, and to make them feel exceedingly and vaguely ill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>All the parties to that instrument thoroughly understood the iniquity of slavery and deplored it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>We condone this because we know that many of these fathers really did believe that slavery was probably going to diminish and die out in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Even while protecting it they hoped for the best, and knew not what they did. But as slavery became more important instead of less important, and as the cruelty of it became more visible, the bond of the document pressed upon the conscience of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>We had undertaken more than we could perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>This tumult began long before it showed itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Its dialectic and logic were developed and ready for use, like the wings of the locust in the shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The gigantic backbone of business-interest was a slavery backbone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Now there is nothing more injurious to the character and to the intellect than the suppression of generous emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>For this latter opinion he had the most fantastic reason; namely that, although the residents of the <rs>District</rs> had no votes, and were governed by Congress, nevertheless he felt himself to be all the more bound in honor to act during his term in Congress as if he were the representative chosen by the people of that District; that is, to act according to what he knew to be the will of his <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi> constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>There was no demand for an agitator, whose function is always to displace, to disperse, and to pull apart.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Now an agitator is a man who is willing to make use of the members of government, not only for the various purposes for which they are framed,--as, e. g., the <name>Legislature</name> to legislate, the <name>Judiciary</name> to adjudicate, the <rs>Executive</rs> to administer, etc.,--but this man makes use of any or all of them as a machine to spread an idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>At the beginning of that decade Abolition was a cry in the wilderness: at the end of it, Abolition was a part of the <rs>American</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Every breath of the movement was chronicled in the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, every new convert wrote to <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0006.00097.00328" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> for help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>He was the channel into which the new streams flowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>This drawing of the new men into a knowledge of each other made magical heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>Every Abolition act or thought went immediately into the general Abolition consciousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>His gift of doing this was his greatness.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Every leaf and twig, every letter, every quarrel, every prayer, is here preserved in the immortality of petrifaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>To be in himself the focalization and to leave behind him the fossilization of that wonderful epoch was <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0006.00099.00336" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>'s function.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>The crisis in the struggle came in <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1836--"><year reg="1836">6</year></dateStruct>, when a great attempt was seriously made by the whole organized force of the <rs>Slave Power</rs> to put down the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>This suppression was to be done in the ordinary, historic way-through laws to be made against them, and through violence, where law fell short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>It will be seen in an instant that law was, throughout, on the side of the <name>Abolitionists</name>; and this is the reason why the violence was so great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>The South could not get at <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0006.00099.00337" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> through sheriffs and jailers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Therefore it was <pb id="p.100" n="100"/> tempted to resort to riots and extra-legal terrorism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>It was lured into the fabrication of myths &mdash; as for instance, the myth that the constitution protected slavery against adverse opinion, the myth that the <name>Abolitionists</name> favored slave-insurrection, the myth that the language of the <name>Abolitionists</name> was so extreme as to make them the enemies of society, the exceedingly absurd myth that to send Anti-slavery publications through the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> mails directed to adult white men in the <rs>South</rs> was, somehow, an atrocious outrage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The truth is that between <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>, the element of passion was rising past the danger point, and running into something like insanity in the <rs>Southern</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>A madman believes his own logic, and ever drives it further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The failure of law to protect the <rs>South</rs> left no accurate demarcation as to their demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>At the beginning, the slaveholders protested that <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0006.00100.00338" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> should be silenced, because he was a fanatic; but before long they were demanding that the <name>Abolitionists</name> should be hanged, and were mingling the name of <persName n="Channing,,,,," id="n0158.0006.00100.00339" reg="mostcommon:Channing,William,Ellery,,:3"><surname>Channing</surname></persName> in their execrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>In the beginning they demanded only to be let alone; but before long they were swearing that the <rs>South</rs> should <pb id="p.101" n="101"/> buy and sell slaves underneath <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName> monument.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>This tidal fury could not be conciliated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Anything that threatened the existence of Slavery stimulated the fury &mdash; and the time had come when all nature began to threaten Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>Slavery began, in fact, to stalk abroad and horrify the world: Slavery came out of its lair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> there were meetings in the <rs>South</rs>, destruction of Abolition literature in the mails; then white Vigilance Committees, and State Legislatures called, in chorus, upon the <rs>North</rs> to stop the plague of Abolition by the enactment of stringent laws against the reformers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>A giant demonstration was planned by the friends of the <rs>South</rs> to take place at <placeName reg="Faneuil Hall">Faneuil Hall</placeName> in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>--<dateStruct value="1500--"><year reg="1500">1500</year></dateStruct> names being appended to the call for the meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>This meeting was to demonstrate the good faith of the <rs>North</rs> towards the slaveholders, and to give public opinion a set towards the enactment of criminal statutes against Anti-slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>The meeting was a tremendous success and proved to be a sort of <quote>view-halloo</quote> for Slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>It was naturally followed by an increase of riots and mob violence against the <name>Abolitionists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>The most important of the new ebullitions was the so called <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> <pb id="p.102" n="102"/> mob (<dateStruct value="1835-10-21"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="21">21</day>, <year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>), which led <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0006.00102.00340" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> about with a rope round him-and might easily have ended in his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>Here was support from high quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>It was not till <dateStruct value="1836-01-"><month reg="01">January</month>, <year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>, that the time came for <persName n="Everett,,Edward,,," id="n0158.0006.00102.00342" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, to take notice of the entreaties of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>This part of his Message was referred to a joint Committee of <num value="5">Five</num> of the <name>Legislature</name>, together with the <rs>Southern</rs> entreaties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>It was in the hearings before this committee, that the work was done which put an end to Southern hopes of enslaving <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>The great attempt was foiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>The South had done its utmost to suppress Abolition, and had failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>After this time, Abolition is in the field as an accepted fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>We must think of this whole Southern movement as a big, mountainous wave, involving multitudinous lesser waves and eddies, which, as it rolled forward and surged back, created complex disturbances, all interlocked with <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>The power of the <rs>South</rs> was exerted over the <rs>President</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and over the ruffian on the street corner, and it was all <num value="1">one</num> power, <num value="1">one</num> pull together, <num value="1">one</num> control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Let us take a rapid but clear glance over certain stages of the movement which have already been mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>The popular feeling at the <rs>South</rs>, which was the motive power of the whole <pb id="p.104" n="104"/> affair, may be illustrated in a paragraph from the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond Whig</orgName></hi>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/></p> 
<p>Let the hell-hounds of the <rs>North</rs> beware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Let them not feel too much security in their homes, or imagine that they who throw firebrands, although from, as they think, so safe a distance, will be permitted to escape with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>There are <num value="1000">thousands</num> now animated with a spirit to brave every danger to bring these felons to justice on the soil of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, whose women and children they have dared to endanger by their hell-concocted plots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>We have <hi rend="italics">feared</hi> that Southern exasperation would seize some of the prime conspirators in their very beds, and drag them to meet the punishment due their offenses.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>This then is the outer ring of fiery feeling which dreamed of moving Northward and doing, it knew not what, to put down Abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>The spirit of violence, as shown, for instance, in the breaking into of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-office</orgName> at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston, S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Now, the only reason why riots do not occur every day, accompanied by destruction of property and injury to unoffending persons, is that the strong arm of law and order is against the ubiquitous loafer and ruffian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Once let this gentleman see a chance of rioting with impunity, and he instantly appears and riots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>How easily then did disturbances follow when State and National officials, as well as the rich and respectable classes, gave the cue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1259"/>We have to remember, in reviewing any convulsive epoch in history, how frequently men, even great men, have been jolted forward and back between conflicting points of view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1264"/>There was another element of complication which assisted in disintegrating the Anti-slavery cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1267"/>With whom shall we sympathize among all these contending sects?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1271"/>Should <pb id="p.154" n="154"/> they be admitted to equal fellowship or not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1272"/>Manifestly they must be so admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1273"/>Yet to do this identified the cause of Abolition with the theory of Woman's Rights, a conclusion most repugnant to many excellent Anti-slavery people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1274"/>There must follow, then, a multiplication of sects; this was <num value="1">one</num> of the logical necessities of the situation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1278"/>His personal course was to resign from the Anti-slavery organizations when they veered away from Constitutional <pb id="p.155" n="155"/> methods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2177"/>Much baggage was jettisoned in the original transit across the sea, much lost during our colonial and frontier period, and finally &mdash; we were stripped bare by the pirate Slavery, and marooned for <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> in a sort of Babylonian captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2178"/>I think there is enough in all this to account for the bleakness of American life as contrasted with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2179"/>I think that the emotions must in youth be fed upon a sort of pabulum that comes down out of the past-songs, aspirations, stories, prayers, reverence for humanity, knowledge of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>;--or else some dreadful barrenness will set in and paralyze the intellect of a race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2180"/>The question sometimes forces itself upon me, Is not the <name>German</name> citizen of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> generation, who walks the streets of New York to-day, more truly a barbarian than his Gothic ancestor who invaded <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> century A. D., and whose magnificent vernacular is preserved in Ulfilas' translation of the <pb id="p.271" n="271"/> Scriptures?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2181"/>In piety, in knowledge of poetry, in reverence, the <name>Goth</name> was more advanced than his American descendant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2182"/>I say, the <name>Suabian</name> peasant of to-day seems to me to be superior to the <orgName n="American Farmer" type="newspaper">American farmer</orgName> in many of those things that make life deep and cause society to endure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2183"/>To cut loose, to cast away, to destroy, seems to be our impulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2184"/>We do not want the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2185"/>This awful loss of all the terms of thought, this beggary of intellect, is shown in the unwillingness of the average man in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> to go to the bottom of any subject, his mental inertia, his hatred of impersonal thought, his belief in labor-saving, his indifference to truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2186"/>The state of mind in which commercial classes spend their lives is not that of pure, self-sacrificing spiritual perception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2187"/>The commercial mind seems, in its essence, to be the natural enemy of love, religion, and truth; and when, as at the present moment in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, we have commerce dominant in an era whose characteristic note is contempt for the past, we can hardly expect a picturesque, pleasing, or harmonious social life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2188"/>Much is lost sight of, much is forgotten among us; much is unknown that in any <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> country would be familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2189"/>For <pb id="p.272" n="272"/> instance, this very man, <persName n="Garrison,,William,Lloyd,," id="n0158.0012.00272.01000" reg="default:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Lloyd</foreName> <surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, is almost forgotten among us. He lived a life of heroism and of practical achievement; the beauty of his whole course was extraordinary, and his type of character is very rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2190"/>Had he lived in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> he would have been classified at once among the great figures of his own generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2191"/>Indeed he was so classified from across the sea. His character would have been prized thereafter as a national possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2192"/>But in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> all that the educated man of to-day knows of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n0158.0012.00272.01001" reg="nearbymention:Garrison,William,Lloyd,,"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName> is that he was <num value="1">one</num> who held impractical views and used over-strong language during the Anti-slavery struggle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2193"/>All this feebleness, whose evidences I have been reviewing, comes, I believe, from a central deficiency of life in the <rs>American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2194"/>It is not a thing which can be cured in the college, or in the school, or in the drawing-room; though the cure will show in all such places as fast as the great patient improves.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>During the very epoch (the decade succeeding the close of the war) when our intellectual blight was at its worst, there began to appear among us compassionate persons founding newsboys' halls in the <placeName key="possibilities=131" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Five Points</placeName>, prison angels, and <orgName n="Police Court" type="court">police court</orgName> <pb id="p.273" n="273"/> visitors, saints knocking at the doors of the poor &mdash; men filled with love and pity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>This new gospel of love now absorbs whole classes of people in American life, and swallows the young as the <name>Crusades</name> once swallowed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>I hear schoolmasters and learned men complain that their most brilliant classical scholars insist upon doing settlement work the moment they graduate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>Why do the young people of both sexes take this course?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>What planetary influence depletes the exhausted ranks of scholarship, and makes traitors of these trained minds to the cause of learning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>In their new career their old education goes apparently for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>They themselves cannot tell you. And yet they are justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2202"/>These young people are being governed by that higher law which governed St. Francis-the law which he also knew how to obey but could not explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>Our young people express by their conduct a more potent indictment of the cultivation and science of the older, dying epoch than could be written with the pen of <persName n="Ezekiel,,,,," id="n0158.0012.00273.01002" reg="mostcommon:Ezekiel,nomatch:0"><surname>Ezekiel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>The age has nothing in it that satisfies them: they therefore turn away from it: they satisfy themselves elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/>In so doing they create a new age. The deeper needs of <pb id="p.274" n="274"/> humanity can only be met slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>It required several <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> for the meaning and importance of <placeName key="tgn,2637157" n="1.000 2" reg="saint francis, cross, arkansas">St. Francis</placeName> to become apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>To his contemporaries he seemed to be a disciple sent to the poor; yet his influence ultimately qualified the art and letters, and tinged the philosophy of life of several centuries.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>All these new saints of ours.-new Christians, and loving persons who crowd the slums, and rediscover <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0158.0012.00274.01003" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in themselves and in others-lack power to explain; they merely exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>Through them, or rather through the heart which they infuse, literature and intellect will return, art and mental vigor will be restored to us. It would seem that the bowels and viscera of society must be heated <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and thereafter in time &mdash; it may be a century or <num value="2">two</num>--a warmer life will reach the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>These new grubs that creep out of the ground, these golden bees that dart by us in the sunshine, going so directly to their work like camp nurses, are more perfect creatures than we are, in that they deal with humanity as a unit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>You and I are nothing to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>They have a relation to the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>They are living in a beam which we do not see, they are the servants of a great <pb id="p.275" n="275"/> cure which we cannot give, and do not understand.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>So also in regard to the <rs>Anti-Slavery Movement</rs>; the importance of that Movement comes from the fact that it meant piety, truth, and love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>The rest is illusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>In a certain sense the slaves were freed too soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>That short-sighted element in the philosophy of Abolition, which saw Slavery as the <name>Antichrist</name> (whereas the spiritual domination of evil was the real Antichrist), ended by putting Slavery to its purgation so quickly and so convulsively that many features and visiting cards of slavery were left behind in the nervous system of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>This was no <num value="1">one</num>'s fault: it was the method of nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>An after-cure was necessary; and we have been undergoing an after-cure, and need more of it. I regret the loss of the old cultivation; and yet I know that none of our older cultivation was ever quite right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>The American has never lived from quite the right place in his bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>Nevertheless if we are but patient the loss will be restored to us tenfold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>We are living in the age of a great regeneration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>There is hardly a man in whose face I do not see some form of it. New hope is with us. Very different is <pb id="p.276" n="276"/> our mission from that of the <name>Abolitionist</name>, though both are forms of the same power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>Anti-slavery was the narrow, burning gate of heaven, seen by a few men, who fought their way towards it, paying with their lives for every step in their progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>Crags overhung them: society hated them: every man was their enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>In our new crusade no <num value="1">one</num> is our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>The spirit is felt in all men. In some, it moves in the heart crying, <persName><foreName>Abba</foreName></persName>, Father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>Others it leaves speechless, but makes their lives beautiful through unselfish labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>Still others it illuminates with visions, so that we see men and women who live like angels, running up and down in the celestial light, passing forward and back between <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and man, bringing health to many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>In other hearts it has broken the old shackles of prejudice, and shown to them the common bond that lives in all religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>The churches have been growing liberal-for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the history of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>Other classes of men glow with an enthusiasm for science which is becoming a form of worship for truth, differing chiefly in name from religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>It is as if a truce had been sounded in that antique war that has raged forever over creed form and <pb id="p.277" n="277"/> scientific theory, and as if every <num value="1">one</num> were standing in silence, thinking of the realities which lie and which have always lain behind the noisy dogmas and the certified formulas of human thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>The wrecks of many creeds are being clashed together like the cakes of ice in the <rs>Hudson</rs> during a great <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> thaw; while the strong river bears them all forward in triumph.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>Great and small, learned and unlearned meet upon that plane of common humility which is their only meeting ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>It is a period when the power and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-hand mystery of life is recognized on every side, and when the conventions and lies that dam and deny that power are for the time being widely broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2237"/>I do not say that the dams will remain down forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>People are building at them all the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>Trade interests, personal selfishnesses are indefatigably at work like ants &mdash; contesting every inch of the damage, inventing new dykes, denying that any permanent change has taken place.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>Let us be glad that we are born in this age and within the swirl and current of the new freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>Let us do each our share to leave the dams down, and not build them up in our own bosoms; for it is in <pb id="p.278" n="278"/> peoples' bosoms that all these dams exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/>We must permit the floods of life to run freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2243"/>It is not from any <num value="1">one</num> of our reforms, arts, sciences, and churches but out of all of them that salvation flows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2244"/>What shall we do to assist in this great process?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2245"/>What relation do we bear to the movement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2246"/>That is the question which requires a lifetime for its answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2247"/>Our knowledge of the subject changes constantly under experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2248"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we desire to help vigorously; and we do all in our power to assist mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2249"/>As time goes on, we perceive more and more clearly that the advancement of the world does not depend upon us, but that we, rather, are bound up in it, and can command no foothold of our own. At last we see that our very ambitions, desires and hopes in the matter are a part of the <rs>Supernal Machinery</rs> moving through all things, and that our souls can be satisfied and our power exerted only in so far as we are taken up into that original motion, and merged in that primal power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>Our minds thus dissolve under the grinding analysis of life, and leave behind nothing except <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>Towards him we stand and look; and we, who started out with so many gifts for men, have nothing left in our satchel for mankind except a blessing. </p></div1>
