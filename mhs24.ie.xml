<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/><emph>I</emph>N a former issue of the <name>Register</name>, its readers have been enabled to perambulate the town lines; in this they may learn of its towers, ancient and modern.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Consulting our dictionary we find a tower to be a structure tall or lofty as compared with its basal size, and are referred to spire, pagoda, campanile and steeple as related thereto.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>We remember that in our earliest schooldays a geography or atlas had upon its cover a grouped picture of the world's then tallest buildings, the great pyramid of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> forming its background.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Its apex of <measure n="500feet" type="distance">five hundred feet</measure> was the limit of human constructive ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>Contemporary with it was <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Gleason,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00001" reg="mostcommon:Gleason,Thomas,,,:6"><surname>Gleason</surname></persName>'s Pictorial</hi>, which carried into many homes, weekly, a view of <placeName>Boston</placeName> from the harbor, its crowning feature the <rs>State</rs> house dome and cupola, accentuated by the many church spires of that time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>That was before the age of steel and the erection of modern office buildings; and no <num value="1">one</num> thought then that the granite custom-house would grow to a height exceeding <persName n="Cheops,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00000.00002" reg="mostcommon:Cheops,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheops</surname></persName>, or of a <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 300">three-hundred-foot</orgName> structure in <placeName>Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The same authority (the dictionary) tells us that towers were originally built for religious or memorial purposes or for defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But an older Book tells of the earliest tower of which we have record, in these words, <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>And they said, Go to, let us build us a city, and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name. . . and they left off to build the city.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Hard burned brick laid in bitumen is most durable construction, but the purpose failed to pass inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><pb id="p.2" n="2"/> Evidently this tower of centuries agone was not <num value="1">one</num> of religion, and failed of completion as a memorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Read this about <num value="1">one</num> for defense and shelter as it is told in old <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00003" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>That mentioned in the parable was a watch-tower.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>And now we come to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> tower, its use or purpose both secular and religious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It was that of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> meeting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Indeed, we have often wondered why its height, <measure n="33feet" type="distance">thirty-three feet</measure> to the eaves, was so disproportionate to its width of <num value="38">thirty-eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It being built in the valley, perhaps on the site of a brickyard, those early citizens may have emulated a little the ambitions of others, and, tall as their new meeting-house was with its pyramidal roof, they built thereon a <hi rend="italics">little tower, i. e</hi>., a toweret or turret, and in it later was placed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> bell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But it was nearly a century after its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settling that <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> acquired this visible distinction which is a feature of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Though the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meeting-house, on the <q direct="unspecified">great rock by Oborn rode,</q> never had this distinguishing exterior feature, it had <hi rend="italics">in</hi> its pulpit a <q direct="unspecified">little tower,</q> or <hi rend="italics">tourelle</hi>, in the person of its minister, who spelled his name <persName n="Turell,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00004" reg="mostcommon:Turell,Ebenezer,,,:4"><surname>Turell</surname></persName>,&mdash;which would indicate that his ancestors were of <name>French</name> extraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>To him it was given to be the occupant of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> pulpit during its entire existence and to begin that of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>That <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> pulpit only lacked supporting pillars under its <q direct="unspecified">sounding board</q> (it being suspended by an iron rod), to make it almost a duplicate of the bell turret, the only example of which latter now remaining is that in <placeName reg="Hingham, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049904">Hingham</placeName>, built in <dateStruct value="1681--"><year reg="1681">1681</year></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In <dateStruct value="1669--"><year reg="1669">1669</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1670--"><year reg="1670">70</year></dateStruct> was built the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> meeting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This had the feature of <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">a tower from the ground</hi>,</q> whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> floor formed a vestibule, and contained a staircase leading to the gallery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Higher up, may (prior to <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>) have <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> been stored the town's stock of powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We are assuming this last, as such was the custom elsewhere.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This tower was quite imposing in appearance, <num value="5">five</num> stories in height, and stood directly against the easterly <hi rend="italics">end</hi> of the meeting-house, which was of ample proportion to accommodate the growing town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was surmounted by an open belfry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A lofty, tapering spire, which latter seems to have been an afterthought, was a visible monument to <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s <q direct="unspecified">civic pride.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Whether its builders had disposition to <q direct="unspecified">crow over their neighbors</q> of <address><street n="Woburn street">Woburn</street></address>, <placeName reg="Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1126718">Malden</placeName> and <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName> or over <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> (some of whose territory had lately been acquired) may not be said; but upon this lofty spire was perched a great brass rooster, beside which the present <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00005" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> bird is but a chicken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We were told by an eye-witness that <persName n="Swan,,Sam,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00006" reg="default:Swan,Sam,,,"><foreName>Sam</foreName> <surname>Swan</surname></persName>, who lived next door, captured this same brass bird (which fell at his feet when the spire was pulled down in <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>), and carried it home with him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> story of this tower was placed in <dateStruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></dateStruct> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s public clocks, a gift to the town by <persName n="Brooks,the Honorable,Peter,Chardon,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00007" reg="default:Brooks,Peter,Chardon,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Peter</foreName> <foreName>Chardon</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>To be historically correct, read hereafter, by the <hi rend="italics">villagers' clocks</hi>, and do no injustice to the famous poem.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Before the rooster's downfall the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> bell was safely lowered, and with the clock had a resting time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>At the completion of the new <persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00010" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName> meetinghouse (for such it was still called) both clock and bell were placed in its <hi rend="italics">steeple</hi> for <measure n="54years" type="date">fifty-four years</measure> more of associated service.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But by this time the style of meeting-house architecture had undergone a change, and <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> people followed the <q direct="unspecified">fashion</q> and <q direct="unspecified">steepled church edifices</q> <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> came into vogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There had also come a varying thought in the religious belief of the people, sufficient to require several houses of worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The great meetinghouse on the hill, with its <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">tower from the ground</hi>,</q> was the last built by municipal appropriation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>State and church being separated, each church organization must build for itself, and according to its taste and means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>That they did so may be seen in the illustrated pages <num value="340">340</num>-<num value="41">41</num>-<num value="42">42</num> in <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00011" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Peter,Chardon,,"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName>' History of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>These views are worth a careful study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They show a sturdy character, sensible and careful construction, architectural taste, both elaborate and modest, in all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In that of the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Congregational Meetinghouse, <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>,</q> we find the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the <q direct="unspecified">storied steeples</q> built in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Note the colonnaded front with its wreathed entablature; also the consoles under the sloping roof cornice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But we see none of this upon the sides of the structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Its windows show circular tops, but this may have been only exterior blinds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But the <num value="4">four</num>-storied steeple, with its massive urns, clock dials and louvers, its final section octagonal and domed, all show the skill of an architect, and set the style of the next <num value="5">five</num> to be built in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Next was the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <placeName reg="Parish Meeting-house">Parish Meeting-house</placeName> (<persName n="Unitarian,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00012" reg="mostcommon:Unitarian,nomatch:0"><surname>Unitarian</surname></persName>) <dateStruct value="1839--"><year reg="1839">1839</year></dateStruct>,</q> a little larger on the ground; here again a colonnade of <num value="4">four</num> detached columns and <num value="4">four</num> pilasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>A similar treatment of the sides shows it to he classic <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, in its lines almost severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But its tower was <num value="1">one</num> worth seeing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In the gable beneath, was a circular window whose sash bars resembled the equator, parallels and meridians of the map of the hemispheres, and enclosed in a wreath of carved woodwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> story, in which was the clock, resembled the die of a monument, and each cornice had a gabled pediment, each corner surmounted with the conventional honeysuckle in carving, as was each corner of the building itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>More elaborate was the belfry colonnade above the clock, whose <num value="4">four</num> dials were encircled by a carved wreath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><pb id="p.5" n="5"/> Next above the belfry was an octagon story with a fluted pillar at each corner, and this was topped by a circular section, also pillared and domed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Both these had an ornamental metallic cresting at the edge of the cornice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Whether intentional or not, the artist shows the vanes (similar in appearance) of these <num value="2">two</num> towers pointing in opposite directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>An idea of the size of these <num value="4">four</num> columns may be had from the following, told by <num value="1">one</num> of the workmen who assisted at its building: Accidentally dropping his hammer therein, he procured a rope and lowered a boy down inside, who securing it was safely hoisted out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Of the <num value="3">three</num> other views mentioned, the <q direct="unspecified">Universalist, <num value="1832">1832</num></q> shows the colonnade effect in <num value="4">four</num> pilasters, and an unspired steeple of <num value="2">two</num> stories with diminutive turrets at the <num value="4">four</num> corners, while the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Methodist Meeting-house">Methodist Meeting-house</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>,</q> has but a single-storied and <num value="4">four</num>-gabled cupola, with larger and taller corner turrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>By <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct> we find the <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Mystic Church">Mystic Church</placeName>, Congregational</q> following in the steps of its mother, with a colonnaded front of <num value="4">four</num> Corinthian pilasters (still recognizable in the present edifice)and a circular window, similar but larger than that of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Parish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Unlike either, it had no steeple of any sort, and we may put the time of its erection as about that of the decadence of steeple building, for the fashion was to change.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Thus far we have written of the tower, the turret and steeple, and their erection and use in connection with the meeting-house, now by custom (also changeable) called church, and so since <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>As these of the various faiths were erected, there was no occasion for others until the growth of the town toward its border lines made it, and by that time the <q direct="unspecified">fashion</q> had changed and the tower came into its own again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>St. Mary's, on <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, near <placeName reg="Malden line">Malden line</placeName>, whose brick tower in which is a clock paid for by <persName n="Medford,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00013" reg="mostcommon:Medford,nomatch:0"><surname>Medford</surname></persName>, was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to build.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Then <orgName n="Grace Church" type="church">Grace church</orgName>, out growing its wooden chapel of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, acquired largely <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> through the munificence of <persName n="Brooks,Mrs.,Ellen,Shepherd,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00014" reg="default:Brooks,Ellen,Shepherd,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Ellen</foreName> <foreName>Shepherd</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName> its beautiful stone church with <q direct="unspecified">ivy mantled tower.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In &lsquo;<num value="72">72</num> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Methodist and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <persName n="Baptist,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00006.00015" reg="mostcommon:Baptist,nomatch:0"><surname>Baptist</surname></persName>, and in &lsquo;<num value="73">73</num> Trinity Methodist and the <rs>Congregational</rs> (both the latter at <placeName reg="West Medford">West Medford</placeName> and new organizations) erected new houses of worship&mdash;a remarkable record for <num value="2">two</num> successive years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>All these were of wood; all had the features of a corner tower and belfry, with spires varying from <num value="48">forty-eight</num> to <measure n="140feet" type="distance">one hundred and forty feet</measure> in height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In <num value="3">three</num> the town placed public clocks, at the expense of about <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> each.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In <dateStruct value="1876--"><year reg="1876">1876</year></dateStruct>, the <num value="2">two</num> Congregational churches near <address><street n="Medford square">Medford square</street></address> united, and enlarged and remodeled the building on <address><street n="Salem street">Salem street</street></address>, erecting a corner tower, belfry and spire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>To it was removed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> clock bought by the town (in &lsquo;<num value="70">70</num>), with its associated and former political bell, where they still remain in service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Previously, both had been in the tower of the <placeName reg="High, Lamar, Texas" key="tgn,2389483">High</placeName> street edifice, erected in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, replacing the <q direct="unspecified"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Congregational Meetinghouse, <dateStruct value="1824--"><year reg="1824">1824</year></dateStruct>,</q> burned in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Sold to the <rs>Roman Catholics</rs>, little change was made in exterior, only the closing of the louvers of the belfry and the substitution of a gilded cross for the weather-vane on the spire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It was told that a bit of pleasant repartee occurred between the <rs type="place">Mystic Church</rs> pastor and the parish priest on <num value="1">one</num> occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The former, in passing, accosted the latter, who in his robes was overlooking the work, with <q direct="unspecified">Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>what are you doing now?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>and got the reply, <q direct="unspecified">Sure, we are taking down the emblem of Protestantism and putting in its place that of Christianity.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>We never heard that there was any extended argument over the matter, and venture the opinion, that however convenient it may be to know the way the wind blows, a church spire is an inappropriate place for an ever shifting wind vane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Yet <num value="2">two</num> such remain today.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="4">Four</num> have been removed by destructive fire and in rebuilding have not been replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was at the time of its placing styled <q direct="unspecified">the golden gate,</q> because of its resemblance in shape to the old-style farm gate, made by balancing a tree upon a <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> pivot, with its interwoven branches closing the space below it.

It was the architect's design to have the iron spindle, on which the vane swung, at the front end of this ridge, but the builders suited their own convenience, placing it in the middle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In <dateStruct value="1885--"><year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct> the vane became damaged, the <q direct="unspecified">butt of the log</q> slanted downward and appeared likely to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>To add to the danger, several slates near the apex had become loosened and hung by <num value="1">one</num> nail in an angular position, <num value="1">one</num> directly over the side entrance door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Being <num value="1">one</num> of the <q direct="unspecified">committee on repairs</q> who could find none willing to undertake the job, the writer, with no previous experience as steeplejack, undertook its removal and repair himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>Evidently the diarist foresaw that in a century customs might change, and also the use of words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>So he added more to his original entry, also using the word entertainment as satisfaction of curiosity and information to the inquisitive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>Entertainment has come to be a many-sided word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>In later days than those, such occasions were known as <q direct="unspecified">bees,</q> perhaps because of the <hi rend="italics">swarms</hi> of people that came and their <hi rend="italics">busy</hi> work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>To eke out the parson's salary a donation bee was the precursor of the modern pound party; while the spelling bee lacked the co-operative work feature.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>It has seemed advisable to devote some space in this issue of its Register to its own history, and call public attention thereto.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>In response <num value="54">fifty-four</num> attended, and the desirability of organizing a <orgName n="Historical Society" type="society">historical society</orgName> was discussed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>Another meeting was held on <dateStruct value="-05-8"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="8">8</day></dateStruct>, and steps taken to incorporate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>On <dateStruct value="-05-22"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="22">22</day></dateStruct> its charter was issued by the secretary of the commonwealth, and on <dateStruct value="-05-23"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="23">23</day></dateStruct> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stated meeting was held in the <rs>Unitarian</rs> vestry.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The next meeting (of record) was on <dateStruct value="-11-8"><month reg="11">November</month> <day reg="8">8</day></dateStruct>, and was held in the old <placeName reg="Francis house">Francis house</placeName>, numbered two <address><street n="Ashland street">Ashland street</street></address>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>That the new Society began with enthusiasm is evidenced by the fact that during the week of <dateStruct value="-10-14"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="14">14</day></dateStruct> to <num value="20">20</num> a <q direct="unspecified">Historic Festival</q> or pageant, called <q direct="unspecified">On the <name>Banks</name> of the <rs>Mystic</rs>,</q> was held in the <rs type="place">Opera House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The idea was a novel <num value="1">one</num> and was favorably received by the public, as shown by its liberal patronage and large attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The committee in charge, though for a time startled by its temerity in its production because of the great expense involved, was happy at its close, and at that <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> meeting turned into the <rs>Society</rs>'s treasury the net proceeds of <measure n="1018.21dollars" type="currency">$1,018.21</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The Society hired the <rs type="place">Francis house</rs>, which had a little historic interest, having been the home of <persName><foreName>Convers</foreName></persName> <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> <persName><foreName>Francis</foreName></persName>, the originator of the <rs>Medford</rs> cracker, and also the birthplace of his talented daughter and authoress, <persName n="Child,,Lydia,Maria,," id="n0334.0017.00046.00262" reg="default:Child,Lydia,Maria,,"><foreName>Lydia</foreName> <foreName>Maria</foreName> <surname>Child</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>It also made some repair and refitted it for Society use, and furnished the same.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>In <dateStruct value="1902--"><year reg="1902">1902</year></dateStruct> the property was placed in the market for sale and was then purchased by the <name>Society</name> for <measure n="4000.00dollars" type="currency">$4,000.00</measure>. Of this amount <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> was paid in cash, and the remainder provided for by a mortgage and the favorable interest rate of <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>But prior to this purchase the various expenses had absorbed the proceeds of the historic festival already alluded to, and several efforts of lesser magnitude had been unremunerative.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>The cash payment was the result, mostly, of donations for that specific purpose, secured mainly through the efforts of <persName n="Brown,President,David,Henry,," id="n0334.0017.00046.00263" reg="default:Brown,David,Henry,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>The meetings of the <name>Society</name> have been on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> Monday in the months from <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> to <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> inclusive, and for several years a <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> course of addresses was added to the regular meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>At nearly all meetings, other than the annual, addresses have been given and papers read relating to <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, its history, institutions and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Many of these have been reproduced in the <rs>Society</rs>'s quarterly publication, the <rs>Historical Register</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Its issue was begun in <dateStruct value="1897--"><year reg="1897">1897</year></dateStruct> for that express purpose, and its <num value="24">twenty-four</num> volumes represent a labor of love on the part of its editors and contributors, and contain information of <persName n="Medford,,,,," id="n0334.0017.00046.00264" reg="mostcommon:Medford,nomatch:0"><surname>Medford</surname></persName> found nowhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>By its exchange list with other societies it is constantly adding their publications to the <rs>Society</rs>'s library, thus making available sources of information.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The existence of the <name>Society</name> started the effort for the preservation of the <rs type="place">Royall house</rs>, and also <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s <num value="275" type="ordinal">two hundred and seventy-fifth</num> anniversary celebration, so successfully observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>At that time former <persName n="Hooper,President,,,," id="n0334.0017.00046.00265" reg="mostcommon:Hooper,John,H.,,:2"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Hooper</surname></persName> prepared a brief history of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>, which was published by the <orgName n="City Committee" type="committee">city's committee</orgName> (composed of members of the <name>Society</name>), together with a full report of the exercises of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/><pb id="p.47" n="47"/></p> 
<p>The questions may be asked, <q direct="unspecified">How is the <rs>Society</rs>'s work appreciated by the community it serves, and how is it sustained, either financially or otherwise?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/></p> 
<p>We reply, its only revenue is its annual dues of <measure n="1.00dollars" type="currency">$1.00</measure> from each member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>It reached its high-tide of membership in <dateStruct value="1902--"><year reg="1902">1902</year></dateStruct>, about <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num>, and now numbers <num value="151">one hundred and fifty-one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>It has no endowment whatever, and in all its <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> has never had any <hi rend="italics">bequest</hi> of funds, and contrary to a prevailing notion, has never had a penny of municipal assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Thus it will be seen that its efforts have been heroic and <q direct="unspecified">a labor of love.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Its current and publication expenses for several years exceeded the annual income, and the deficit was covered by donations of interested members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>In <dateStruct value="1914--"><year reg="1914">1914</year></dateStruct> the latter were insufficient, and a new administration found itself with a debt of over <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> and the problem of much-needed repairs on the building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The latter seeming impractical, the property was sold and temporary quarters secured.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>The enterprise of securing a new and permanent home was begun in the summer of <dateStruct value="1916--"><year reg="1916">1916</year></dateStruct>, and is so recent as to require little mention in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Land was purchased of the city of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> (at the assessors' valuation, which was <measure n="629.00dollars" type="currency">$629.00</measure>), and paid for out of the net amount received from the sale of the old property, the balance, <measure n="371.00dollars" type="currency">$371.00</measure> (with accrued interest) being turned into the <orgName n="Building Fund" type="fund">building fund</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Thus was conserved the amount originally invested in its former home.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>None too soon was this enterprise begun, as circumstances proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>It would be a pleasure to record that the people of <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> responded liberally and extended a helping hand, but the fact remains that scarcely more than a dozen people outside the <rs>Society</rs>'s membership responded to its appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Then came the war time, and during the numerous <q direct="unspecified">drives</q> for funds the <name>Society</name> had no chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>At the earliest possible moment, without waiting for the building's completion, the <name>Society</name> moved in, ceasing its outlay for rent and reducing its expenses <pb id="p.48" n="48"/> to a minimum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>To the casual observer it appears complete, but in the stress of war time and over-topping prices there remain some essential fixtures yet to be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>It has been suggested several times to get a mortgage to do these things, but the <name>Directors</name> have wisely refrained therefrom, remembering that interest payments come with inconvenient frequency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The new home on <address><street n="Governors avenue">Governors avenue</street></address> <hi rend="italics">never</hi> has had such ornament (?) and whatever problems of administration the <name>Society</name> may have, arise not from any debt upon its home, but rather from the lack of public interest in its important work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>To the meetings of the <name>Society</name> every member is entitled to bring friends, with the thought that such may become interested and become members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>A few have thus in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>Like other similar societies, many of its members rarely attend the meetings, but are prompt in remitting their annual dues to the <rs>Treasurer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>This is, of course, a help, but the burden of sustaining the interest in the stated meetings and the management of affairs falls upon the few. To secure a larger membership and interested working force is an ever-pressing need to enable it to <hi rend="italics">better</hi> prosecute its work.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/><num value="1">One</num> of our number on reading the foregoing pages remarked, <q direct="unspecified">It is not an appeal to save a sinking ship, <hi rend="italics">but for a working crew</hi>.</q>

<p>Given a larger membership means better support, added interest and better service in coming years.</p>

<p>All hail to your determination to celebrate another tercentenary, this time <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName>'s own affair, commemorating its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> view by the white men, and Pilgrims at that!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/><pb id="p.62" n="62"/></p> 
<p>Responding to your question as to what I know or think about the visit of Miles Standish to these parts in <dateStruct value="1621-09-"><month reg="09">September</month>, <year reg="1621">1621</year></dateStruct>&mdash;well, I didn't know much, but your request set me to reading, as I suppose you expected it to do. And I began to appreciate something of the amount of special skill and patch-work labor necessary to enable you even to ask the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>But our interest in <placeName key="tgn,7014023" n="1.000 4" reg="medford, middlesex, massachusetts">Medford</placeName> makes it quite worth while to follow out your leads as to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> white men on the site of our city, and how they came to be there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>In the first place, none of the chroniclers of the day says directly that <persName n="Standish,,,,," id="n0334.0022.00062.00336" reg="mostcommon:Standish,nomatch:0"><surname>Standish</surname></persName> was on the expedition anyway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/><persName n="Bradford,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0022.00062.00337" reg="mostcommon:Bradford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Bradford</surname></persName> says they dispatched on <dateStruct value="-09-18"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="18">18</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="-09-10"><day reg="10">ten</day></dateStruct> men with Squanto for their guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>He names no <num value="1">one</num> else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>The author of <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Mourt,,,,," id="n0334.0022.00062.00338" reg="mostcommon:Mourt,nomatch:0"><surname>Mourt</surname></persName>'s Relation</q> gives no other names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>But the latter does speak of the <q direct="unspecified">Captaine,</q> and we are well persuaded that no such expedition would have sallied forth during his lifetime without the leadership of that doughty little pepperpot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Furthermore, as the writer of the <q direct="unspecified">Relation</q> speaks always of <q direct="unspecified">our</q> doings in the expedition, I suppose that we may conclude that <persName n="Winslow,,,,," id="n0334.0022.00062.00339" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><surname>Winslow</surname></persName> was of the party&mdash;of course, assuming that the future governor wrote this portion of the history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Apparently it is from the <q direct="unspecified">Relation,</q> mainly, that we must get particulars of the journey: how that, setting forth in the shallop on the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="2">eighteenth</day></dateStruct>, they found the way longer than they expected (being as they estimated it close to <num value="20">twenty</num> leagues), so that they did not arrive within the bay until late on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">nineteenth</day></dateStruct>; how they landed on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> on <num value="1">one</num> side of the bay, where they made a treaty with Obbatinewat, after which they sailed across the bay, and there anchoring, slept once more aboard ship; then on the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">twenty-first</day></dateStruct>, how they made afoot their memorable journey which particularly interests us, to the hill where <persName n="Nanepashemit,,,,," id="n0334.0022.00062.00340" reg="mostcommon:Nanepashemit,nomatch:0"><surname>Nanepashemit</surname></persName> had lived, thence to the fort in the bottom lands, and a mile further on to <hi rend="italics">fort on</hi> the hill where <persName n="Nanepashemit,,,,," id="n0334.0022.00062.00341" reg="mostcommon:Nanepashemit,nomatch:0"><surname>Nanepashemit</surname></persName> was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/><pb id="p.63" n="63"/></p> 
<p>As to my own reflections thereon, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> items stand prominently forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>How came the <name>Pilgrims</name> to be here at this time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/><persName n="Bradford,,,,," id="n0334.0022.00063.00342" reg="mostcommon:Bradford,nomatch:0"><surname>Bradford</surname></persName> says the party was sent to spy out and report upon the country of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs>, and to make a peace treaty with that tribe, by whom they had been more or less disturbed, and to whom Squanto gave a bad name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>Incidentally, never forgetting the main chance, they were to do such trading as they found practicable with the natives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Our Pilgrim forbears seem to have displayed towards their <name>Indian</name> neighbors no thought of conquest or of hostility of any kind, seeking, as it appears, rather a peaceful co-operation and friendliness, wherein they certainly showed as much wisdom as philanthropy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>And if they lost no opportunity for a bargain, nevertheless their commercial operations seem to have been conducted with the most scrupulous conscientiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>My own feeling is that this quality had as great a military as moral value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Secondly, it appears their <name>Indian</name> neighbors were possessed of a wholesome respect, at least, for the visitors, which we are told arose partly from their terrors of the white man's gunpowder, and partly from a suspicion that he was able to let loose upon them anew the plague from which they had aforetime suffered so severely.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>As to the report made by the expedition on the territory they visited we shall heartily agree with their conclusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>In this connection their is plenty of room for sober reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Beyond all doubt the place for a great settlement is <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and not <placeName reg="Plymouth, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014421">Plymouth</placeName>, and the adventurers were shrewd enough to recognize that fact immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>For in spite of their prime object of isolation from foreign entanglements, they never had any idea of giving up communication with the home country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/><hi rend="italics">That</hi> they desired to make as easy as possible, and that meant, of course, a harbor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>They missed <placeName key="tgn,1114422" n="1.000 1" reg="boston harbor, massachusetts, united states">Boston harbor</placeName> for various reasons, perhaps chiefly because they had never heard of it; and <pb id="p.64" n="64"/> you will remember <persName n="Brigham,Professor,,,," id="n0334.0022.00064.00343" reg="nearbymention:Brigham,Jennie,S.,,"><roleName n="Professor">Professor</roleName> <surname>Brigham</surname></persName>'s hint that only a blinding snowstorm hid <placeName reg="Barnstable Harbor, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,1114416">Barnstable harbor</placeName> from the adventurers on that memorable expedition from <placeName key="tgn,7015018" n="1.000 14" reg="provincetown, barnstable county, massachusetts">Provincetown</placeName> which finally found and selected <placeName reg="Plymouth, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014421">Plymouth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/><placeName reg="Barnstable, Barnstable, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014989">Barnstable</placeName> as a harbor would appear far more attractive than <placeName reg="Plymouth, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014421">Plymouth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>What if it had not snowed on that boisterous <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> day?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>But here again, those of us who stand by providential dispensation will find a text.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/><placeName reg="Plymouth, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014421">Plymouth</placeName> was practically a deserted village site cleared for settlement and in some part made ready for their habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>The later colonists who had had a chance to hear of it, and better opportunities to settle about it, were quick enough to find the bay with its <q direct="unspecified"><num value="100">hundred</num> islands,</q> and its <num value="2">two</num> navigable inlets which the <q direct="unspecified">Relation</q> says <q direct="unspecified">we</q> heard of from the <name>Indians</name> but did not enter.</p>
