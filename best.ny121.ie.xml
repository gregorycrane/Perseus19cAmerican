<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>In compiling a History of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 121">121st Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="NYVolunteer">New York Volunteers</orgName>, the writer feels handicapped by <num value="2">two</num> facts: He is not an original member of the regiment, but was transferred from the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY16">16th N. Y.</orgName> in the spring of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>; and after his transfer, he did not serve in the regiment, having previously been detailed for clerical duty in the <orgName>office of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs></orgName> of the <name>Brigade</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>Consequently he never had that close personal relation with the members of the regiment that would give to his writing the intimate character of a fellow soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>On the other hand, however, his position gave him the advantage of a close observer; for all the orders from the higher authorities and all the reports of the brigade and regimental commanders passed under his hand, and he was able to estimate more fully the character of the services rendered, and the estimation in which those services were held by the superior officers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The several sources from which this history is compiled are: the records of the regiment, the reports of regimental and brigade commanders, the diaries of several members of the regiment, and several books already published covering the same events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Of these the diary of <persName n="Beckwith,Colonel,Clinton,,," id="n0171.0001.00000.00001" reg="default:Beckwith,Clinton,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Clinton</foreName> <surname>Beckwith</surname></persName>, notes by <persName n="Smith,Lieutenant,J.,H.,," id="n0171.0001.00000.00002" reg="expanded:Smith,James,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, the chapters in the <name>History</name> of <placeName reg="Otsego, New York, United States" key="tgn,7014318">Otsego County</placeName>, prepared by <persName n="Cronkite,Colonel,J.,W.,," id="n0171.0001.00000.00003" reg="expanded:Cronkite,James,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Cronkite</surname></persName>, the letters of <persName n="Adams,Chaplain,John,R.,," id="n0171.0001.00000.00004" reg="default:Adams,John,R.,,"><roleName n="Chaplain">Chaplain</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> and the diary of <persName n="Woodcock,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0171.0001.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Woodcock,Philip,R.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Woodcock</surname></persName> have been especially useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/><persName n="Beckwith,Colonel,,,," id="n0171.0001.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Beckwith,Clinton,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Beckwith</surname></persName>'s diary is as it professes to be, the <quote>story of his own <pb id="p.-001" n="-001"/> army experiences, and of his comrades and of the regiment from the enlisted man's viewpoint.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>That he has given permission to quote <foreign lang="la">ad libitum</foreign> from it is very gratifying to the compiler, as it will certainly be also to the readers of the history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/><persName n="Cronkite,Colonel,,,," id="n0171.0001.00001.00007" reg="nearbymention:Cronkite,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Cronkite</surname></persName>'s history of the regiment in the <name>History</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7014318" n="1.000 3" reg="otsego, new york, united states">Otsego County</placeName> is a condensed sketch of the most important facts connected with the services and exploits of the regiment; but as it may be be protected by copyright the facts and not the words, are freely used.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The compiler bespeaks for his work the same kindly regard that has been shown him by the <rs>Regimental Association</rs>, in welcoming him to its membership, and honoring him with this privilege of writing its history.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The task assigned to <persName n="Smith,Lieutenant,James,H.,," id="n0171.0001.00001.00008" reg="default:Smith,James,H.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName n="James">Jas.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> of collecting photographs of the officers of the regiment, and of having half-tone reproductions made of such as could be secured, for use in this volume, he has found a very difficult undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It will be remembered by our surviving comrades that photography during our service was just emerging from the daguerreotype, and the tintype, into photographic prints on paper, and that practically all photos made in those days were of the <quote><persName n="Visete,,Carte,,,de" id="n0171.0001.00001.00009" reg="expanded:Visete,Carte,,,"><foreName>Carte</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Visete</surname></persName></quote> size (<num value="2">2</num> <num value=".125">1/8</num> x3 <measure n=".625inches" type="distance">5/8 inches</measure>). Hence the necessity for the diminished size of most of our illustrations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It was found to be impossible to secure any considerable number of photos of the line officers (captains and lieutenants) hence we concluded to omit all such, and confine our efforts to securing for illustrations only those who served as commanders of our Corps, Division, Brigade and Regiment, and the regimental field officers, and some of the latter we are also obliged to omit, as we were unsuccessful in every effort to secure the <pb id="p.-002" n="-002"/> necessary photos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We wish, however, to thank all those who by loaning to us such photographs as they have, have thereby made our illustrations as complete as we could have hoped for at the present day.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The red cross which appears on the cover of this book was adopted in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct> as the emblem of the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">1st Division</orgName> of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">6th Army Corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It therefore antedates by many years the <orgName n="Red Cross Society" type="society">Red Cross Society</orgName>, as well as its use as a hospital emblem.

<head>Introduction</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>As each individual of a family is distinguished from the rest by peculiar characteristics, and each family in a community differs from every other family, so nations and races are distinguishable in like manner, the regiments, brigades and corps of an army acquire peculiarities by which they can be distinguished from all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>These peculiarities depend upon and are developed by several conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The. character of the men composing the organization, the circumstances under which it was organized, the ability and efficiency of the leaders, all combine to produce an <foreign lang="fr">esprit de corps</foreign> which is capable of indefinite variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In this respect the <num value="121" type="ordinal">121st</num> was especially fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Its original members were young men of fine personal character, the companies were recruited from neighboring townships, it was officered by the men who had conducted the recruiting, and was assigned to a brigade, division, and corps that had no superiors in the army.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">Sixth Corps</orgName> was commanded by <persName n="Sedgwick,Major-General,John,,," id="n0171.0002.00004.00010" reg="default:Sedgwick,John,,,"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>, the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> by <persName n="Slocum,Brigadier-General,H.,W.,," id="n0171.0002.00004.00011" reg="default:Slocum,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Slocum</surname></persName>, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">Second Brigade</orgName> by <persName n="Bartlett,Brigadier-General,J.,J.,," id="n0171.0002.00004.00012" reg="expanded:Bartlett,Joseph,J.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Under these officers the brigade had acquired an efficiency and reputation that immediately affected favorably the newly assigned regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They were all officers of marked military ability, who thought little of mere display, and much of soldierly efficiency, whose effort was not to make themselves conspicuous, but to make the troops under them <pb id="p.-005" n="-005"/> capable of the best service under every exigency of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But the officer, to whom the regiment was most indebted for the development of its brilliant individuality, was undoubtedly <persName n="Upton,Colonel,Emory,,," id="n0171.0002.00005.00013" reg="default:Upton,Emory,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Emory</foreName> <surname>Upton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He came to it soon after its entry into active service, a recent graduate of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName>, with a fine reputation, attained by efficient service during the previous campaign as an artillery officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Eagerly efficient, strict, yet just in discipline, wise in administration, cool and fearless in danger, he was able to win and hold the respect and admiration of the men under him, and to mold them into the model fighting regiment that they became.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>To the present day, every survivor of the regiment is proud to have served under the command of <persName n="Upton,General,Emory,,," id="n0171.0002.00005.00014" reg="default:Upton,Emory,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Emory</foreName> <surname>Upton</surname></persName>. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This effort developed in <num value="2">two</num> directions: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to fill up the older regiments with recruits; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, to organize new regiments, <num value="1">one</num> in each <orgName n="Senatorial District" type="district">Senatorial District</orgName>.

In our front, extending as far as <num value="1">one</num> could see, from right to left was a range of mountains, and between us and it, a considerable valley, and nestling at its farther side, near the base of the mountain, was a small village, its tall church spire standing out clear and white against the foliage of the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Far away to the right, where the sound of the cannon grew upon the ear, the smoke of the guns became distinct and visible, and the faint rattle of musketry was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Our road seemed descending the side of a considerable declivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Very soon a cannon opened in our front, and it was said to be a <q direct="unspecified"><persName><foreName>Johnnie</foreName></persName></q> battery and some of the men pointed out the position of the enemy on the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>As we hurried down the side of the valley we could see a line of our troops filing off in the fields towards the village of <placeName reg="Burkettsville, Attala, Mississippi" key="tgn,2208099">Burkettsville</placeName>; and farther up the side of the hill, a thin line of men, skirmishers, were moving towards the wooded slope of the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>These were soon fired upon from the timber and returned the fire, and we could see for a short time the puffs of smoke from their rifles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>A turn in the road hid them from our sight, but we were interested in another feature of the entertainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The battery which we had seen on the mountain crest farther up, evidently had us in view, for in addition to its report we heard a strange sound, a whistling, singing noise in the distance, and a solid shot flew over us and buried itself in the soft earth across the creek along side which we were now marching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Instantly many inquiries were made as to what it was, and all about it, and we were told that it was a shot from a <orgName n="Confederate Battery" type="battery">Confederate battery</orgName> fired at us, and that we were now under-fire and within range of the enemy's guns, and might be struck <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> at any moment or instant, with <num value="1">one</num> of those projectiles.

We were front faced in line of battle, and moved forward a short distance and told to lie down, that we were in an enemy's country, and also told to keep out of sight and not expose ourselves to view, as the enemy were only a short distance in advance of us; and a battle would soon take place.

<p>The weather was cool and the air crisp, rendering marching more agreeable, and we jogged along in eager anticipation of something better than that which we had left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>We could see nothing ahead of us, but about noon the report of cannon was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>During the afternoon we were passed by a lot of men having in charge a balloon which was up just above the treetops They were moving rapidly toward where the sound of cannon came from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> balloon we had seen, and created a good deal of comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>It was said that the balloon had been of great service to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n0171.0007.00039.00218" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, enabling him to discover the movements of the enemy's troops, and locate their position, and that of their batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The next day when we reached the flat near the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, we saw the balloon again up a considerable distance and occupied by an officer who was busily engaged in scanning the hills beyond the river with a glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>The Rebels fired several shells at the balloon but they burst a good way from it, and did not disturb its occupant at all.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Off to our right there was <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> firing and considerable musketry, and some also in our immediate front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>In the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">Battle of Fredericksburg</rs> the position of these Grand divisions was, after crossing the river, in the order of their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The Right and Central Divisions crossed the river directly opposite the city on pontoon bridges, which they had difficulty in building because of the sharpshooters concealed in the houses along the bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>They were finally dislodged by troops ferried across in pontoons, and the <num value="2">two</num> bridges were completed on which the <name>Right</name> and Central Grand Divisions crossed.

The <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> crossed before the <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num>, and the most vivid recollection the writer has of that crossing, is the fact that the surface of the bridge was carpeted with playing cards, and the surface of the river was almost covered with cards that had been thrown away by those who had crossed on the bridges above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It was evident to all that a bloody battle was to be fought and few men wanted to go to certain death with gambling devices in their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Since that time the writer has never doubted the essential wickedness of gambling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>With death as the chief arbitrator there were no valid arguments in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>In the years since that day he has seen nothing to change his views on the subject.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>After crossing the river the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> bore off to the left and the <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num> advanced over the level plain next the river and entered the deep broad cut made by <placeName reg="Deep Run, Page, Virginia" key="tgn,2281284">Deep Run</placeName>, and followed it to within gunshot of the foot of the hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Here it remained-or our part of it did-while the battle raged on the right and left, with disastrous results to the <rs>Union</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>The dreadful slaughter on the right in the effort to carry the <rs>Stone Wall</rs>, the repulse of <placeName reg="Franklin, Franklin, Virginia" key="tgn,2111847">Franklin</placeName>'s feeble effort on the left, and the repulse of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n0171.0007.00041.00228" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Joe,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s half-hearted attack on the heights behind the city, have been often described and much controversy as to the responsibility for the failure has resulted.

This <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n0171.0007.00042.00231" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> positively denied, and declared that <placeName reg="Franklin, Franklin, Virginia" key="tgn,2111847">Franklin</placeName>'s failure to press his advantage and <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n0171.0007.00042.00232" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Joe,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s reluctant advance when ordered to do so, were the real causes of the failure of the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The part which the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">Second Brigade</orgName> took in this battle was comparatively unimportant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The hills in front were too steep to justify an assault, and the banks of <placeName reg="Deep Run, Page, Virginia" key="tgn,2281284">Deep Run</placeName> furnished shelter from the artillery of the enemy, so that the chief duty of the regiments of the <name>Brigade</name> was to do skirmish or picket duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>We moved early on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="12">12th</day></dateStruct>, which was <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, up towards the heights, crossing a deep gully along the bottom of which a little stream ran towards the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The sun rose and dispelled the fog, which was heavy and thick and covered the flats of the river like a blanket, also concealing from view the hills in our front, at the same time screening us from the enemy's observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>Looking back towards the river, there was a mass of troops in motion, including infantry, artillery and cavalry, equal in number to an <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>In our front the fog was slowly receding toward the heights and as soon as it revealed some of our moving troops, they were greeted with a shotted salute from the <orgName n="Confederate Battery" type="battery">Confederate batteries</orgName> in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Almost at once <persName n="Hexamer,,,,," id="n0171.0007.00042.00237" reg="mostcommon:Hexamer,nomatch:0"><surname>Hexamer</surname></persName> drove by on a gallop with his battery of <measure n="3inch" type="distance">three-inch</measure> steel <name type="weapon">Rodmans</name>, and their sharp, fierce bark soon joined the chorus of other sounds; and this splendid, energetic artillery officer with his <pb id="p.43" n="43"/> able command soon quieted his adversaries in his immediate front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>We remained several hours lying in the ditch or hollow at the roadside, which screened us from observation and sheltered us from the artillery fire of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>I should think about <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> a battery of brass Napoleons, <num value="12">twelve</num>-pound caliber, with brass handles or trunnions, came rattling up the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>We were ordered to fall in and moved out of the road, and the battery swung into position in front of us, on the highest part of the rising ground immediately before us, and unlimbered and went into action, firing rapidly and continuously for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>To this the enemy replied with equal vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>I should judge from the number of shot and shell that flew over, around and about us through it all, that those battery men worked with precision and regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The officer, <persName n="McKnight,Captain,,,," id="n0171.0007.00043.00238" reg="mostcommon:McKnight,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>McKnight</surname></persName> I think, moved among the gunners giving orders and directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>All the while we lay close to the ground, and we could see very distinctly the working of the battery in all its details and hear the commands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>The fire of this battery was replied to by the enemy, but I do not think their fire did any harm to our battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Their shells seemed to burst nearer to us than to the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Some of them flew away beyond us. Each shell seemed to have a different note or tone and none of them could be called musical.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Some were fiendish and seemed to say <quote>I've got you, I've got you.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Several burst near us and the fragments knocked up the ground considerably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>I don't think he realized what struck him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>In the morning before daylight we were roused up, told to get our breakfast and get ready to go on the picket or skirmish line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Sure enough, his prediction or presentiment proved true, for he had scarcely reached the advance line when he received a mortal wound.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>We moved up the creek that runs through the gully before mentioned, followed it a considerable distance toward the enemy until we came to a point where it turned toward the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Here, under the bank it made, and the shelter it afforded, our picket reserve was posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>When we reached this point it was daylight and objects could be seen distinctly for some distance in the direction of the enemy, but a considerable fog still hung over the low ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>We moved rapidly past the reserve and out into the unsheltered field, deployed as skirmishers from our left squad, which was my squad, and ran forward on a double quick to our line, which I could not see when I started, but which we reached in going <measure n="70yards" type="distance">seventy yards</measure>. The <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> instant we got near them, the men on picket sprang up and began firing, and as we advanced beyond them they, the <orgName type="regiment" key="NJ15">15th N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/>Nothing had been said to us, no orders had been given, and I doubt very much if our officers knew what was expected of them, or us. I stood where the <rs>Jersey</rs> men had left me for a little time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>I looked in front of me. Along a sort of meadow ran a rail fence separating it from a piece of woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>From this fence sprang out puffs of smoke, and the instant hiss of a missile in our vicinity told us that we were the object of the rifleman's attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>In the brief time I had been standing there I saw that we were in a bare, unsheltered place, and several men of the regiment that we had relieved were lying in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>I examined my arm and side, but found to my great relief that excepting a numbness, they were all right, and I immediately turned my attention to the fellows in our front who were seeking to assist us in shuffling off this mortal coil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>We fired at them several times, but they returned our compliments with accuracy and earnestness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>I got my tin plate out of my haversack for a starter and soon scooped out a hole which afforded some shelter from the sharpshooters in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>In the meantime <rs>Delos Doxtater</rs> had crawled back to the reserve to have his wounds cared for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> was fired at a great many times, but rode along leisurely and showed no concern or fear, and finally went out of my sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>The fact is, my attention for many long, weary, perilous hours was taken up by the attentions of the devils down there in the edge of that timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>I can recall now, as the continual flight of musket balls around, about and over us, and shells from the batteries on both sides passed over us for a time, what we did and said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>After a little halt in the street we moved on, filing to the left directly up the street and over the ground that the center of the assaulting column had passed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>At every step evidences of the deadliness of the enemy's fire accumulated and behind a ruined brick building, just on the outskirts of the city, a ghastly row of desperately wounded men had been gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Scattered at very frequent intervals from it, and until within a very few yards of <placeName reg="Maryes Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2495439">Marye's Heights</placeName>, hundreds of human forms dotted the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>The ambulances were up and the stretcher bearers were bringing in the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>The dead were in every position, just as they had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>Reaching the redoubt occupied by men of different regiments that had participated in the assault, mostly men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="WI6">6th Wisconsin</orgName> and the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="ME7">7th Maine</orgName>, we heard the terrible experiences through which they had passed, and the struggle in the redoubt, for the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Looking from <placeName reg="Maryes Heights, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2495439">Marye's Heights</placeName> toward the city any soldier standing behind the breastworks, as I did, would <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> feel his ability to destroy any number of foes advancing against him and I wonder that any of that devoted column had escaped death; and I ceased thinking of the pride and exultation which the survivors manifested, to the exclusion of thought for their comrades lying silent in death on the bare slope over which they had safely passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Many times since have I thought of that stirring scene and compared it in my mind with other conspicuous deeds of valor recorded in the annals of war, and always ended with the opinion that it was as stout-hearted and cool-headed a piece of work as ever was done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>All that I have described occurred in less time than I can tell about it. We moved over the ground without making any long halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>After moving up the road a little distance a battery in our front opened on us and a shot from it passed over us. A few minutes later the popping sound of musketry in the distance attracted our attention and we could see our skirmish line pushing forward and the enemy's line opposing it, but falling back slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>From here on we moved forward quite slowly, and at the next halt filed off from the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Here we passed a staff officer whose horse had been wounded through the thick of his hind leg and the poor beast stood there with the blood spurting out at each pulsation of his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>This officer stated that the enemy were deployed in line of battle ahead of us, that he had no earthworks and would not stand our advance in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>We moved across the fields a long distance in columns of fours and finally after getting up pretty close to our skirmish line, which did not seem to be pushing the <rs>Rebel</rs> skirmishers back very rapidly, we were put in line of battle and moved forward some distance by regimental front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>The skirmishers in our front, a <orgName type="mil" key="NJRegiment">New Jersey regiment</orgName>, <pb id="p.68" n="68"/> with white canvas knapsacks, which I remember distinctly, were strengthened by the picket reserve having deployed, and moved forward to them, and they immediately moved forward more boldly and pressed back the <rs>Rebels</rs> who were then sheltered by the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>In our front the skirmish fire became steady and well sustained, and the tone of the <rs>Rebel</rs> bullets indicated that they were not a great way off. In a few moments the <name>Jerseymen</name> disappeared in the woods, and we moved up to the rail fence running along the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>This we quickly, by orders, took down and laid flat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>Glancing back I saw a regiment coming up in line of battle, the officer riding at its right being the <rs>Colonel</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="PA96">96th Penn.</orgName> I judged it was that regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>To the right I could see very little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Behind us there were no troops coming up, but <persName n="Bartlett,General,,,," id="n0171.0008.00068.00384" reg="nearbymention:Bartlett,Joseph,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName> and staff were a little way off. <persName n="Wilson,Captain,,,," id="n0171.0008.00068.00385" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,Robert,P.,,:4"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, who was <persName n="Bartlett,General,,,," id="n0171.0008.00068.00386" reg="nearbymention:Bartlett,Joseph,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>'s A. A. General, and who for some reason had been nicknamed <quote>The Spook,</quote> rode up to the right of our regiment on a gallop, which was his usual custom, and almost instantly we moved into the wood, which seemed to be mostly <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> growth and thickly grown up with underbrush of the oak variety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I can remember now a strange sort of quiet in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>I had no idea, nor do I think any <num value="1">one</num> near me had any premonition of any impending calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>I was the extreme left man in the ranks of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Joe Rounds, I think, was the sergeant on the left of the company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>We moved at an ordinary step forward into the woods perhaps <measure n="70yards" type="distance">seventy yards</measure>, with no sound except a growl from <persName n="Casler,,Eli,,," id="n0171.0008.00068.00387" reg="default:Casler,Eli,,,"><foreName>Eli</foreName> <surname>Casler</surname></persName> because some <num value="1">one</num> had held a bush as he passed and let it fly back into his face.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The firing seemed to be coming to us, and reaching the distance I have named we came nearly <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> up to our skirmish line and they commanded and received our admiration, for the plucky and persistent way in which they did their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>The officer commanding just in front of us was a brave man and understood his business thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>He shouted to his men to move up and push forward on the right, and fired his revolver at something in front that I could not see. At that instant there was a yell of pain and <persName n="Proctor,,Arthur,,," id="n0171.0008.00069.00388" reg="default:Proctor,Arthur,,,"><foreName>Arthur</foreName> <surname>Proctor</surname></persName>, a young man from <placeName key="tgn,2070591" n="1.000 3" reg="mohawk, herkimer, new york">Mohawk</placeName>, a little way up the line cried out that he was shot, and Herringshaw took hold of him and began to help him. A little farther off another was hit and we were immediately ordered to <quote>fix bayonets and forward, double quick, charge,</quote> and we went forward on the run. What became of those skirmishers I could not see. I suppose they pushed their opponents as far as they could, and then lay down and let us charge over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>We moved forward on a run a distance of not more than <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> until we could see the clearing beyond the woods, when suddenly as if by magic, a line of men rose up and delivered their fire almost in our faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>The crash seemed terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>I was paralyzed for an instant but continued to move on. <persName n="West,,Benny,,," id="n0171.0008.00069.00389" reg="default:West,Benny,,,"><foreName>Benny</foreName> <surname>West</surname></persName> who was next to me gave a terrible bound and pitched against me, shot dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Hank <persName n="King,,,,," id="n0171.0008.00069.00390" reg="mostcommon:King,Oliver,,,:1"><surname>King</surname></persName> stuck his gun up against the side of my head, as I thought, and fired, and I pointed my gun at the men in front of me and fired, all the time moving forward and over a little ditch into the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>The men who were in the ditch and behind the brush fence through the gap in which I passed, jumped up and ran, some to their rear and some to ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>I loaded and fired up the road twice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Joe Rounds stood beside me doing the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The fire from the enemy seemed to come from that direction, but it was so smoky that I could not see much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>A <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> little way off I remember a fellow standing, who seemed to be holding something before him which seemed like a blanket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/><persName><foreName>Joe</foreName></persName> said, <quote>Let's get back into the edge of the woods,</quote> which we did. I then saw the <orgName type="regiment" key="PA96">96th Penn.</orgName> coming up to our rear and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>As I stepped back I saw Bill <persName n="Wildrick,,,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00391" reg="mostcommon:Wildrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Wildrick</surname></persName> and <persName n="Steinfort,,John,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00392" reg="default:Steinfort,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Steinfort</surname></persName> lying shot, and a couple of men who were wounded came there and asked to be carried back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Just then <persName n="Dain,,John,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00393" reg="default:Dain,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Dain</surname></persName> said he was hit. He mistook the water running from his canteen, which a bullet had pierced, for blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>I remember I laughed at the expression on his face at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>I kept looking and firing in the direction from which the bullets seemed to come, and our fellows kept crowding down among our company to get away from the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>After a time the smoke cleared a little and I could see some buildings, and from a brick building which we afterwards learned was <orgName n="Salem Church" type="church">Salem church</orgName>, came the fire which was so destructive to us. There seemed to be men in the church who were firing from the windows, and our men were crowding away from it toward us to escape being hit. In front of us and to the left there were no Rebels that I could see. How long we would have stayed there I do not know, I suppose until we were attacked and driven away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>I realized how useless it was for us to stay, but did not know enough to run, and it was well that <persName n="Wilson,Captain,,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00394" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,R.,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> of <persName n="Bartlett,General,,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00395" reg="nearbymention:Bartlett,Joseph,J.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bartlett</surname></persName>'s staff rode up and ordered us back, accompanying the order with the inquiry, <quote>D-n you, don't you know enough to fall back?</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>I started to go back rather slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>I think <persName n="Yoeman,,,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00396" reg="nearbymention:Yoeman,Ed,,,"><surname>Yoeman</surname></persName> and <persName n="McTague,,Pat,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00397" reg="default:McTague,Pat,,,"><foreName>Pat</foreName> <surname>McTague</surname></persName> were near me then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>A lot of our fellows were lying down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>I remember Joe Rounds shouting, <quote>Come on, we're ordered back,</quote> and then seeing Sile <persName n="Goodrich,,,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00398" reg="nearbymention:Goodrich,Silas,,,"><surname>Goodrich</surname></persName> and <persName n="West,,Benny,,," id="n0171.0008.00070.00399" reg="default:West,Benny,,,"><foreName>Benny</foreName> <surname>West</surname></persName> who had been shot dead, and having the thought come to me, <quote>Why, these men <pb id="p.71" n="71"/> are all shot and dead.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>I went back through the woods helping along a <orgName type="company" n="Company F">Company F</orgName> man who was wounded in the shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Where I came out of the woods was farther to the left, and near where the <orgName type="regiment" key="PA96">96th Penn.</orgName> went in, and a little way out in the field was a pool of water where we stopped and filled our canteens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>A great many men were scattered about in the fields all going back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>I thought the <orgName type="regiment" key="PA96">96th Penn.</orgName> was still in the woods behind us, but found it was not so, when <persName n="Wilson,Captain,,,," id="n0171.0008.00071.00400" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,R.,P.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> came riding up and ordered us to go over to a house some distance away where our regiment was assembling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>He said the enemy were now advancing through the woods and if we remained there <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> we would all be captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Well now, the way we got up and moved away from there must have convinced the <rs>Captain</rs> that we believed him. I went across the fields toward the house he had spoken of with a number of others, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was an orderly sergeant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>We kept to the left as the <rs>Rebels</rs> were firing some from the right, and got a canteen of good water from the spring near the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>A little while after I reached the regiment <num value="1">one</num> of <orgName type="company" n="Company H">Company H</orgName>'s men was killed and he was the only man shot while we were there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The regiment looked but little larger than a company had looked in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>After dark we moved back about half a mile, and that night slept on our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The next morning those who had got lost, and those who had been back with the wounded and prisoners came up and increased our number considerably, but there was an awful gap in our company, more than half had been killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>I had very fortunately escaped, and with the exception of a bullet hole through the visor of my cap tearing the cloth and scratching my head, I had no mark of the conflict upon me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>With the exception of some skirmish firing along our front and some ways off, no struggle occurred near us. Some distance away the sounds of battle, loud, continuous and approaching, which did not betoken success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>But the day wore silently and listlessly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>Now and then the gallop of staff officers would awaken some comment and interest, until along about <time value="4:30oclock">half past 4 o'clock</time>, the opening of a battery and sharp musketry on our right, and the appearance of a strong skirmish line advancing in our front, immediately followed by heavier and continuous artillery and infantry firing upon our right, caused us to spring up and watch the scene before us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>Shortly a line of battle came out of the woods where we had gone in the day before, and the battery in our front opened with every gun and fired as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>We could see that the shots about, around and through their line of battle were making great gaps, but they closed up and came forward again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Our skirmish line made a fierce resistance and stubbornly contested their advance, but we expected it to give way and let the <rs>Rebel</rs> line come up and give us a chance to revenge our loss of the previous day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>A <pb id="p.74" n="74"/> deep ravine ran along our front, and no troops could have reached us without an exhausting climb down and up its steep sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>But we got no opportunity to fire at them, and had to be content to see our skirmishers and artillery shoot them down as long as they stood up and advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>The continuous rattle of musketry, broken by heavy volleys, and the increasing roar of the artillery indicated deadly, desperate work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Be that as it may, as soon as the sounds of battle had died away, we were ordered in line, cautioned to keep silent, and moved back toward the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>There was some firing on the picket line, and quite a rattle of musketry up the road on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>We reached the high ground near the river after several hours crawl through the woods, no sound breaking the stillness except the lonely screech of the owl and the doleful screech of the <quote>katydid.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>There we found our batteries posted, the guns so close together that there was scarcely room to work them, and we moved up close to them and lay down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>After some hours we moved across the river, a few cannon shots bidding us a parting farewell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>Our dead comrades, our missing friends, were more missed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>To give the facts in the case of the recruits to the <num value="2">two</num>-year regiments and their claim, a full statement ought to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>They were enlisted under a definite promise and understanding that they would be retained in the same regimental organization or discharged with the rest of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>When the regiments were disbanded both of these pledges were ignored and they were ordered to report to the <num value="121" type="ordinal">121st</num> at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Their protest against this action was submitted to a Board of Investigation, and this Board reported in their favor, so they were organized into an <orgName n="Independent Battalion" type="battalion">independent battalion</orgName> and assigned to duty as guard at <placeName reg="Brigade Headquarters">Brigade Headquarters</placeName>, until the report of the <name>Board</name> should be acted upon by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>So the report came back disapproved on the ground that these men had enlisted for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> and that the government was not responsible for the illegal acts of its agents, or the false promises they had made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>Of the other question, as to the detention in the old regimental organization, nothing was said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>We had supposed that in joining the old regiments we were doing the best we could for the army and the country; that the plan to fill up and retain the old organizations was the wisest policy and would be adopted by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>In this, according to high military authority, we were right, and it is now conceded that the disbanding of the old regiments, and the organization of so many new ones was a military blunder resulting in the unnecessary loss of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men who had to enter upon hard campaigns <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> and desperate battles with little experience and slight training, and no encouragement of example and precept from old and experienced comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Of this mistake the <num value="121" type="ordinal">121st</num> is certainly a good example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>Raw men in companionship with veterans and under experienced officers become efficient soldiers much more quickly than can be the case with new officers and new men learning new things by hard won experience under unfavorable conditions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>We were very short of entrenching tools, and so we utilized an old icehouse to bury those dead <persName n="Yanks,,,,," id="n0171.0008.00080.00437" reg="mostcommon:Yanks,nomatch:0"><surname>Yanks</surname></persName> in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>We nearly shot away the head logs on the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>The Rebels elated by their success in forcing us back for a short space from their captured works, vainly endeavored to take the guns, and for a time withstood the terrible slaughter of the combined infantry and artillery fire, but finally gave up the attempt and sullenly retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/>Not however until they had shot the men and horses, and in fact disabled the guns themselves with musketry fire.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/>It was also at this time that the works on both sides were crowded with combatants and the killing and wounding of the closely crowded men was awful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>The smoke from the guns and bursting <pb id="p.146" n="146"/> shells mingling with the mist and rain sometimes obscured the view of the <rs>Rebel</rs> works, close as they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>The accumulation of the dead and badly wounded increased the horror of the situation and added to the desperation of the combatants and their efforts to bring the battle to a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/>Where we occupied the reverse side of the breastworks, men would load and stick their guns over the head log and raising the butts of their pieces, fire down into the mass of men huddled on the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>Now and then a soldier or an officer, crazed with excitement, would jump upon the parapet and fire down into the enemy, but they speedily paid the penalty of their reckless daring, by being shot, and falling to <num value="1">one</num> side or the other.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>Batteries behind and in front of us kept the air full of the shrieking noise of their projectiles, and a <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar battery</orgName> behind us sailed shell after shell over us, and dropped them on the massed Rebels in the trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>The rain fell continuously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>Occasionally a lull would occur in the firing for a little time, and many Rebels, taking advantage of it, would raise a white flag and surrender themselves as prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/>An incident of this kind would be followed by a burst of firing again, usually better directed than the preceding <num value="1">one</num>, and so we stopped the white flag business, the last squad of surrendering Rebels, about <num value="30">thirty</num> of them, getting the fire of both sides, nearly all being shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>So the battle continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>Ammunition was brought up on pack-mules, and served to us. Some of it would not fit our guns and the boxes with other emptied boxes, filled with dirt and placed in front of us, made some protection.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>After <time value="12pm">noon</time> the <rs>Rebels</rs> finding it useless to attempt to drive us back to our works, slackened their fire somewhat, but it was not till dark that the firing <pb id="p.147" n="147"/> diminished below the roar of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>It was a day never to be forgotten for its fierce fighting, bulldog tenacity and terrible slaughter.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>Just before dark we got word for <persName n="Upton,,,,," id="n0171.0013.00147.00812" reg="nearbymention:Upton,Emory,,,"><surname>Upton</surname></persName>'s men to assemble behind our rifle pits in the rear, and many went back, but I waited until after dark, preferring to stay where I was, than to run the gauntlet of the rain of bullets, that swept the ground up to the crest, or rise, in our rear.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/>Being nearly starved we got some hot coffee and cooked some pork and crackers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/>We were all covered with mud and powder and smoke and grime, hands parboiled with rain, and our clothing loaded with moisture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/>We presented a very tough appearance, but being very near exhaustion it was possible for us to huddle about the smoky pine fire with our rubber blankets over us and get some sleep, even though bullets and shells flew in close proximity to us, at frequent intervals during the night.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>In the morning the <name>Rebs</name> were found to have fallen back from the <quote>Bloody angle</quote> during the night, and the firing had almost stopped, but sharpshooters kept the curious, and carelessly inclined reminded of their skill.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/>It was commanded by a Frenchman who appeared greatly excited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/>He was never still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>Dancing around the guns while they were being loaded, and springing upon the parapet, when each was fired to observe where the shell fell, he seemed the incarnation <pb id="p.148" n="148"/> of activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>After visiting brigade headquarters, and not having anything else to do, I retired to a safer place and waited for the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>In the morning I went to the angle and surveyed the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/>The wounded had been removed during the night but the dead lay strewn thickly over the ground, on our side of the breastworks, and along the ridge to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>Our loss was terrible but that of the <rs>Confederates</rs> was far greater; and if the importance of the victory of the morning is to be measured by the desperate effort made to retake the position captured, it certainly was a decisive victory. </p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>We moved forward a short distance and were deployed in a heavy skirmish line, taking down a rail fence and making a protection of the rails as best we could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>A little way in our rear was a line of log cabins formerly occupied by the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2127"/>In a moment the men came swarming around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2128"/>In the mean time more musketry was heard, and the noise of the awakening camps grew on the ear, and the long roll of the drums broke out in the different regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2130"/>The roar of the battle increased, growing nearer rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2131"/>We moved a short distance in the direction of the sound, then filed abruptly toward the left and toward the <rs type="place">Middletown pike</rs>, the left of the regiment in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2132"/>For some distance the fog was so dense nothing could be seen, but enough could be heard to warn us that some dreadful calamity had befallen the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2137"/>Following these came a disorderly mass of men, officers and <pb id="p.194" n="194"/> privates, as helpless and panic-stricken a crowd as ever was seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2138"/>They evidently had been aroused from sleep, and grabbing whatever they could put their hands on, had rushed away from the foe they had not seen, and kept on running until they struck our line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2145"/>Finally our officers, seeing that there was no use in attempting to rally them, rode out in front into the fog and hurried them back behind the lines, so that they would not impede our action in checking the advance of the <rs>Rebels</rs>.
