<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Sir,&mdash;It is with deep regret that I make the following report:</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Receiving information that <num value="2">two</num> Confederate officers were stopping at the house of <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="James,Mister,,,," id="n0290.0016.00060.00968" reg="mostcommon:James,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>James</surname></persName>, which is a short distance above this vessel, on the bank of the river, I resolved to make an effort to capture them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>On the night of the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="4">4th inst.</day></dateStruct>, at about <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>, an officer left the vessel in the cutter, with <num value="22">twenty-two</num> men, and landed on the shore abreast of the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/><num value="2">Two</num> negroes, who were left in charge of the boat were attacked by the enemy and killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>The officer in charge of the expedition had nearly accomplished his mission, when, hearing the discharge of musketry, he immediately started for this vessel, and suddenly fell into an ambuscade of about <num value="600">600</num> of the enemy; my men, being completely surrounded, were obliged to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>The guns of this vessel covered the parties during the whole time, but it was not prudent to fire, as we were in danger of killing our own men. In the meantime the enemy had manned the cutter and proceeded to capture this vessel and when more alongside became intimidated and started with all speed down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>In the meantime I had slipped cable, but it was useless to chase the boat, as it had become lost to us in the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>I headed slowly up the river, keeping close to the bank, and was so fortunate as to pick up my officer and <num value="2">two</num> of the men, who had escaped after they had surrendered to the enemy.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>I am painfully conscious I have been the victim of negro duplicity, by trusting in their apparently truthful stories, which has been the cause of this unfortunate disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Surprised as much at the intelligence of the affair as that he should leave his vessel without permission and come down to me.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>When I learned of it I told him positively that I wished him to confine himself to the vessel, and not to send parties ashore.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Unhappily, their plans worked very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The party sent ashore were raw recruits and in charge only of an engineer, that escaped.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>After requesting <persName n="Weitzel,Major-General,,,," id="n0290.0018.00074.01098" reg="mostcommon:Weitzel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Weitzel</surname></persName> to have all the other troops marched out of the city and placed in the inner lines of works, and that no permissions should be granted to enter the city, I took <persName n="Mayo,the Honorable,Joseph,,," id="n0290.0018.00074.01099" reg="default:Mayo,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Mayo</surname></persName>, then mayor of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 16" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, with me to the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>, where I established my headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>With the help of the city officials I distributed my regiments quickly in various sections, and sent some of my staff to inspect the <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">fire department</orgName> and report upon the help we could expect from it. They reported little aid to be expected here, not, as you say, from lack of men, but because most of the hose had been destroyed or rendered useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>The danger to the troops engaged in this terrific fire-fighting, compared to such a fire as that in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, was infinitely enhanced by the vast quantities of powder and shells stowed in the section burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>It was like a contest of innumerable artillery, like that which preceded <persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0290.0018.00074.01100" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,George,E.,,:3"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s memorable assault at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, and was awe-inspiring, punctuated by the heavier explosions of the ironclads in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>Into this sea of fire with no less courage and self-devotion as though fighting for their own firesides and families, stripped and plunged the brave men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">First brigade</orgName>, with what success the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 16" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> have but to look about them to recognize.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Meanwhile, detachments scoured the city, warning every <num value="1">one</num> from the streets to their houses, arresting Confederate stragglers, of whom we had <num value="1000">thousands</num> shut up before night, <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n0290.0018.00074.01101" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Castle Thunder">Castle Thunder</placeName> being soon crowded with them.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>The ladies of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 16" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, whose imaginations had for years been highly inflamed by the rather too lurid descripttons of the <rs>Richmond</rs> press of the barbaric hordes composing the <rs>Union</rs> armies, expecting a scene of mediaevel rapine, thronged my headquarters, <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> frantically imploring protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>They were sent to their homes under the escort of guards, who were afterwards posted in the center house of each block and made responsible for the safety of the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>Although these men were taken indiscriminately from the detail for duty that day from regiments from <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, <placeName reg="New Hampshire" key="tgn,7007564">New Hampshire</placeName>, <placeName reg="Brooklyn, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7015822">Brooklyn</placeName>, Northern and Central New York, and were not selected men, I never heard a complaint of rudeness on their part, but uniformly unstinted praise of their soldierly performance of a trying duty, of which I hear echoes down through the years to this day. Many painful cases of destitution were brought to light by the presence of these safeguards in private houses, and the soldiers divided rations with their temporary wards, in many cases, until a general system of relief was organized.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>You say, <q direct="unspecified">that considering the tumult and panic of that heartbreaking day, the wonder is not that <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 16" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> suffered so greatly, but that it did not fare worse.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>You also say: <q direct="unspecified">From what we have heard there must have been a time when the operations of the <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">fire department</orgName> were practically suspended.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>At <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> that night, with my staff, I mounted my horse and rode through the city on a tour of inspection, encountering no sign of life in the streets except the sentries pacing their beats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>The fire was under control, though still burning, and the silence of death which brooded over the city so lately in the hands of that wild mob, was only broken by the occasional explosion of shells in the ruins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>And now, may I ask you to give to the citizens of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 16" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> the names of the regiments to which all this was due, in justice to and in perpetuation of their memory?</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>That man crept to the front, getting behind a brush on a slight rise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>While lying down behind that brush an incident happened that has always bothered that man. He heard the quick step of a horse to his right and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/>On looking round he saw a horseman in full gallop, coming from the north and going along a small country road that joined the <rs type="place">Warrenton pike</rs> at the <rs type="place">Groveton house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/>On getting to a gap in the fence along the road, he wheeled his horse, passed through the gap, and made directly for the man lying down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>It was done in such a deliberate way that it impressed the vidette that his presence was known before the horseman came along the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/>He did not draw rein until getting almost on the vidette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="983"/>That man was riding a black mare, and wore a long linen duster and dark pants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="984"/>There was something so suspicious about his movements and dress that the vidette would have taken him to <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,,,," id="n0290.0019.00081.01134" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bradley,T.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> if he had had his gun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="985"/>The vidette had seen that party coming along the pike a few minutes before, and could have warned the man riding the horse of the <rs>Yankees</rs>' presence, but a distrust came over him as soon as he saw him. <pb id="p.82" n="82"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="992"/>But you could see the master-hand now, even while I am telling this you could hear the sharp command of an officer, <q direct="unspecified">right face; forward, march,</q> and a body of skirmishers marched out of that confused mass right up to old <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n0290.0019.00082.01140" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>, when the officer gave the command to <q direct="unspecified">file right,</q> and the next instant to deploy, and the movement was done in a twinkle, and forward they went to meet the enemy; <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n0290.0019.00082.01141" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had waited to see this; he then turned to <persName n="Johnson,Colonel,,,," id="n0290.0019.00082.01142" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Bradley,T.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and told him to let his men stack arms and rest, as they had been on duty since the day before; he would not call on them if he could do without them, and off he went with the advance skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="993"/>Another body of skirmishers had in the meantime marched out and filed to the left and gone forward, a column of infantry was unwinding itself out of that mass and marching up to the same point as the skirmishers had, filed to right, fronted and went forward; another was now filing to the left, while the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Command">third column</orgName> moved straight ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="994"/>Some of the artillery followed each column of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="995"/>This was the most perfect movement of troops I saw during the war, and now the crack of musket and the bang of artillery told us that the lines had met; the fire in a few minutes was terrific.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2014"/>Busts of brass and alabaster, pillars of granite and basalt, columns of porphyry and marble yield to the tooth of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2015"/>In the palaces of nature even, the vast domes and cupolas, the towering peaks and rugged crags, fashioned by subterranean fires or cleft by rushing torrents and polished by the sweep of winds, fall victims to decay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2016"/>Men's spirit only lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2017"/>Its product, be it the thoughtful measure or the kindly deed, the word of wisdom or the noble sacrifice of self and substance on the altar to the common good, is never lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2018"/>Cast upon the broad bosom of the ever-surging sea of humanity, deep-running currents, whose secret courses the subtlety of human reason cannot fathom, carry it far and wide, into the habitations of the lowly and to the mansions of the great.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2019"/>Sometimes a man is spared to see it return after its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> circuit, enriched by the homage of the grateful and the tribute of the just; oftener, Time, measured by the stately march of stars, has conquered him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2020"/>Then, when he is resting in his grave, perhaps after a long journey over the thorn-studded path of disappointments, and the tombstone has solemnly mounted its lonely guard to warn off with silent, majestic and awe-inspiring gesture the noisy clamor of petty jealousies and strife, then the fields and gardens are ransacked for their blossoms and a wealth of fragrance is lavishly shed about the grave; then men will rise and outvie each other to do honor to the memory <pb id="p.153" n="153"/> of <num value="1">one</num> to whom they had perhaps denied the barest recognition while he was in their midst.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2021"/>Perhaps 'tis better so. The lasting monument of Influence, based on the firm pedestal of the human heart, needs time to anchor and take root.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2022"/>But once unveiled, it draws with might and main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2023"/>Men flock to its foot to find there the inspiration for noble effort or the worthy deed, a sculptured image or the graven word can never give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2024"/>The poet's unawakened fire is there lashed to flame; philosophers arrest their steps to ponder; the worn and footsore find repose, and others, weaker than the rest, some comfort and some rest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2025"/>At certain seasons the magnetic force of such a monument is doubled, trebled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2026"/>'Tis then the mind calls afresh in long review the life of virtue and of strength, which gave it birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2467"/>My story will be short, for I shall only attempt to describe what fell under my own observation.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2468"/>You ask for a description of the <q direct="unspecified">feelings of the brave <rs>Virginians</rs> who passed through that hell of fire in their heroic charge on <placeName reg="Cemetery Ridge, Wallowa, Oregon" key="tgn,2230296">Cemetery Ridge</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2469"/>The <hi rend="italics">esprit dot corps</hi> could not have been better; the men were in good physical condition, selfreliant and determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2470"/>They felt the gravity of the situation, for they knew well the metal of the foe in their front; they were serious and resolute, but not disheartened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2471"/>None of the usual jokes, common on the eve of battle, were indulged in, for every man felt his individual responsibility, and realized that he had the most stupendous work of his life before him; officers and men knew at what cost and at what risk the advance was to be made, but they had deliberately made up their minds to attempt it. I believe the general sentiment of the division was that they would succeed in driving the <rs>Federal</rs> line from what was their objective point; they knew that many, very many, would go down under the storm of shot and shell which would greet them when their gray ranks were spread out to view, but it never occurred to them that disaster would come after they <pb id="p.185" n="185"/> once placed their tattered banners upon the crest of <placeName reg="Seminary Ridge, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2652283">Seminary Ridge</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2473"/>There was no straggling, no feigned sickness, no pretence of being overcome by the intense heat; every man felt that it was his duty to make that fight; that he was his own commander, and they would have made the charge without an officer of any description; they only needed to be told what they were expected to do. This is as near the feeling of the men of <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n0290.0036.00185.02008" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,George,E.,,:3"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName> on the morning of the battle as I can give, and with this feeling they went to their work.

We did not come up with any of them until after we passed a narrow little ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2758"/>On the far side of this ditch we found a Federal captain with a drawn sword in his hand, and behind him about a score of his men, with guns in both hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2759"/>As none of them attempted to use their arms, I demanded their surrender; but as they would not throw their arms down the men bayoneted a few of them, and I told the men to knock them down and take their arms away; but the cracking of skulls of unresisting me grated on my nerves, and I ordered the men to knock their hands away from their guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2760"/>I tried to make the captain understand what I meant by surrender, but he held his naked sword in both hands and answered in a language which I had never before heard spoken, sung or acted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2768"/>I told him that I would take the men of his little squad; that the only command I had to give was to keep in general alignment with my right flank, and not to waste his ammunition on the pine thicket; that if any of the enemy were in there they were in a deep hollow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>I rode quickly back to my own regiment which had <pb id="p.206" n="206"/> again commenced firing on pine trees, as I thought, and I again stopped them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2770"/>Just then some half a dozen men on both sides of the colors of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA49">49th Virginia</orgName> cried out that they had been shot from behind, that <persName n="Terrell,Colonel,,,," id="n0290.0039.00206.02228" reg="mostcommon:Terrell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Terrell</surname></persName>'s men had shot them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2772"/>I then went back and told the <num value="49" type="ordinal">49th</num> that <persName n="Terrell,,,,," id="n0290.0039.00206.02229" reg="mostcommon:Terrell,nomatch:0"><surname>Terrell</surname></persName>'s men (<orgName type="regiment" key="VA13">13th Virginia</orgName>) had not shot them, and could not have done so without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shooting through the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 31">31st Regiment</orgName> and the angle of the pines; that the enemy in the rear had seen our flags, although we could not see them, and fired on it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2773"/>He answered, all right, that only <num value="2">two</num> of his regiments could squeeze through and that he had been in action with the other regiments on another part of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>I rode back and thought it was time to look up <persName n="Terrell,Colonel,,,," id="n0290.0039.00206.02232" reg="mostcommon:Terrell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Terrell</surname></persName>; started to ride from the left flank of the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num> up the ditch, as it ran eastward over the hill; had gone only a few paces when the head of a man lying in the ditch bobbed up and said that <persName n="Terrell,Colonel,,,," id="n0290.0039.00206.02233" reg="mostcommon:Terrell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Terrell</surname></persName> had sent him there to warn me against coming over that hill, that the enemy swept it with a deadly fire; that he had a strong position which he could hold without my assistance, and that he was using <num value="2">two</num> recaptured guns against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>When I came back to my men I examined the ditch; it was about knee deep, with some <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> of grayish white dirt thrown up on the outside, and was presumably a continuation of the ditch which I saw on my right as I came out of the woods, and connecting this with the fact that the enemy I saw in my rear were within the line of a similar stretch of white earth, running eastward and westward, I concluded from the confused and confusing situation in which I found our men, that we had projected a quadrilateral from our main line of works, silly planned and badly executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2776"/>The ditch in which my men tried to <pb id="p.207" n="207"/> stand was scarcely <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> wide, and the rear ranks sat down on the surface of the ground behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4986"/>The General was riding in advance of his troops, his chin drooped to his breast, downhearted and dejected in appearance almost beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>Bayonets were affixed to muskets, arms stacked, and cartridge boxes unslung and hung upon the stacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>Then, slowly and with a reluctance that was appealingly pathetic, the torn and tattered battleflags were either leaned against the stacks or laid upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>The emotion of the conquered soldiery was really sad to witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>And it can well be imagined, too, that there was no lack of emotion on our side, but the <rs>Union</rs> men were held steady in their lines, without the least show of demonstration by word or by motion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>This startling discovery was intended to fill a gap in history, and I wonder that even the love of fiction inherent to mankind could have led any minds so far astray as to give the slightest, attention, far less attach any credence, to a wild, sensational suggestion the offspring of an overfertile imagination.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>The plain truth is that I had no mission at all, or, if for want of another word it must needs be called so, its conception involved nobody but myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>The genesis of it and its development are set forth in the following narrative:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/>After the successful issue of the <rs>Louisiana</rs> campaign in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, there being no prospects of a speedy renewal of hostilities, and the division I then commanded being in the highest state of efficiency, it occurred to me that I might do some good by conveying information abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5030"/>Letters which I received about that time having strengthened this opinion, I repaired to <placeName key="tgn,7014504" n="1.000 68" reg="shreveport, caddo, louisiana">Shreveport</placeName> in the winter of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, and suggested to <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n0290.0054.00365.03872" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> the advisability of granting me a <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> leave of absence for the purpose of going abroad and of availing myself of the curiosity and interest which the presence of an active participant in the great struggle now going on could not fail to awaken in foreign parts, in order to awaken sympathy with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5031"/>Nor was my purpose as vague and indefinite as might appear thus far. There was <num value="1">one</num> circumstance which gave it substantiality&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> man who was, so to say, the pivot of my self-imposed task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5032"/>This man was not the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, far less <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, but the <rs>Duke</rs> of Morny, an intimate confidant and devoted friend of the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5033"/>As a statesman, he was credited with some shrewdness&mdash;practical, self-possessed, as devoid of enthusiasm as free from prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5034"/>I had some acquaintance with him. I had met him privately several times before leaving <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5035"/>I had introduced to him <num value="1">one</num> of the delegates whom, at an early stage of the conflict, some of the <rs>Southern States</rs> <pb id="p.366" n="366"/> had sent abroad (I believe it was the delegate from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>), and I had noticed on every occasion his readiness to receive information and the unbiased, practical view he took of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5036"/>With him I could talk without hindrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5037"/>I could see him privately, informally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5038"/>He could listen to me day after day without in any manner committing his government, ask any questions he liked, and elicit every information more freely from a mere eye-witness bearing no credentials than he could from an authorized representative of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5039"/>Here, then, wars an advantage which I intended to turn to account during a temporary absence from the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5040"/><persName n="Allen,General,H.,W.,," id="n0290.0054.00366.03873" reg="default:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, an accomplished gentleman and distinguished officer, still suffering from a wound received in the field, was then <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5041"/>I enjoyed his friendship and confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5042"/>He honored me with his esteem, and had lately offered me a presentation sword in the name of the <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">State of Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5043"/>To him I also imparted my purpose, and the question was fully discussed in all its bearings between him, <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n0290.0054.00366.03874" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> and myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5044"/>It is true that as to the intrinsic nature and merits of the conflict I could only repeat what others had said before, yet both <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00366.03875" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n0290.0054.00366.03876" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> concurred in the opinion that my acquaitance with the <rs>Duke de Morny</rs> was an interesting feature, which I might well try to turn to good account during a period of anticipated calm, in which my presence among my troops did not appear of absolute necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5045"/>None of us <num value="3">three</num> were over sanguine about the result of my undertaking, and in our wildest flights of fancy never looked to an armed intervention as within the range of human possibilities; but it did not seem impossible to obtain a modification of a sham neutrality, which worked entirely in favor of the <rs>North</rs>, to which a stream of mercenaries from all parts of the world was constantly flowing, and to secure something like equal treatment to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, especially as regarded their navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5046"/><name>French</name> commercial interests, I well knew, made the mercantile world lean toward the <rs>South</rs>, and, in fact, it is difficult for me even now to comprehend how <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> could, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, submit to a mere paper blockade, in direct opposition to some of their most important commercial and manufacturing interests, when they might have set it aside by a mere stroke of the pen, without probably ever firing a gun over it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5047"/>My journey was, after due consideration, finally decided on. In order to give more weight to my presence abroad I asked General <pb id="p.367" n="367"/> <persName n="Smith,,Kirby,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03877" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> to allow my chief-of-staff, <persName n="Moncure,Major,T.,C.,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03878" reg="default:Moncure,T.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Moncure</surname></persName>, to accompany me; and <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03879" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> said he would avail himself of this opportunity to write a letter to the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 7" reg="france">France</placeName>, of which his aide-de-camp, <persName n="Miltenberger,Colonel,Ernest,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03880" reg="default:Miltenberger,Ernest,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Ernest</foreName> <surname>Miltenberger</surname></persName>, should be the bearer.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>I did not read the letter which <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03884" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> wrote, and, therefore, cannot speak <hi rend="italics">de visu</hi> of its contents, but in a letter addressed to the editor of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Washington Post" type="newspaper">Washington Post</orgName></hi>, bearing date <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03885" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:2"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <dateStruct value="-03-16"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct>, and published in that paper under the heading, <q direct="unspecified">Lost Chapter in History,</q> I note the passage:</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5052"/>I have said that I enjoyed <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03888" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>'s confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5053"/>This is not a mere commonplace sentence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5054"/>In fact, before our departure, <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03889" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> imparted to me a scheme of his of a somewhat surprising nature, and which, at the time, might well have borne the stamp, <q direct="unspecified">Confidential.</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5056"/>Having no memorandum notes at my disposal at the time I write, I cannot give precise dates, but I believe it was in <dateStruct value="1865-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, that <persName n="Miltenberger,Colonel,E.,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03890" reg="expanded:Miltenberger,Ernest,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Miltenberger</surname></persName>, <persName n="Moncure,Major,,,," id="n0290.0054.00367.03891" reg="nearbymention:Moncure,T.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Moncure</surname></persName>, and myself left <placeName key="tgn,7014504" n="1.000 68" reg="shreveport, caddo, louisiana">Shreveport</placeName> on what may have appeared a special mission of some kind.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>Our path lay through the breadth of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and the news of my <pb id="p.368" n="368"/> passage having preceded me, I was met at every stage of our journey by a deputation of citizens, who came to welcome me; nor was I allowed to settle any hotel bill, but everywhere was received and considered as the guest of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/></p> 
<p>So much for history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>The wonderful array of political intrigues, negotiations, conflicting efforts, and warlike demonstrations, supposed to have taken place in the space of a few weeks, perhaps only of a few days, does infinite credit to the dramatic imagination of the author, as well as to the spirit of enterprise which distinguished his <hi rend="italics">dramatis personae</hi>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>Nor are the afterthoughts intended to supply motives for these imaginary facts less ingeniously contrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>I quote again from the aforementioned letter to the editor of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Washington Post" type="newspaper">Washington Post</orgName></hi> (<dateStruct value="1901-03-16"><month reg="03">March</month> <day reg="16">16</day>, <year reg="1901">1901</year></dateStruct>):</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/>* * * <q direct="unspecified">There was a strong feeling at the time west of the <pb id="p.370" n="370"/> <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName> that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was doomed, and the effort was to preserve the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> west of the river to the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific Ocean</placeName> as a slaveholding Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5089"/>Of course, if the <rs>European</rs> nations adopted the plan, it was certain that the vast majority of the negroes from the <name>Carolinas</name> to the river would be moved across it and that section would be an agricultural free-trade community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>It was, of course, an irridescent dream, but some of the ablest men in the <rs>South</rs> were dreaming it.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/></p> 
<p>I should feel inclined to think that it is the dream of a dreamer, and &mdash; that the correspondent of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Washington Post" type="newspaper">Washington Post</orgName></hi> has dreamed it, for I have known all the most prominent men of the <rs>South</rs> and many others who might well come within the designation of <q direct="unspecified">some of the ablest men,</q> and never heard any of them as much as hint at such a venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>Indeed, many of them knew too well that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> proved the greatest bar to every hope of foreign assistance, and that the establishment of a new slaveholding community with the aid of a foreign power was an absolute impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>But apart from this negative objection, I am able to give information of a positive nature which will point to the same conclusion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>I said that while I was at <placeName key="tgn,7014504" n="1.000 68" reg="shreveport, caddo, louisiana">Shreveport</placeName>, preparing for my journey, <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00370.03903" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> had imparted to me a scheme he was then revolving in his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>I will now disclose it. Seeing that the <rs>South</rs> could not replace its fallen combatants, whereas the <rs>North</rs> disposed of an ever-increasing army of foreign mercenaries; moreover, that whenever the <rs>Federals</rs> obtained temporary possession of Southern soil, they kidnapped the negroes and pressed them into military service, <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00370.03904" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>'s idea was to arm the negroes, and as a consequence to give them their freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/>I remember his very words: <q direct="unspecified">Of course,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">we must give them their freedom.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>Such a plan is obviously incompatible with the notion of a retrocession of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> as a slave-holding community, and some interesting conclusions can be drawn from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>In the first place, it shows that a prominent Southern man, thoroughly acquainted with all the conditions of political and social life in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, felt a perfect confidence in the loyalty of the black population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>Many Northern men would, no doubt, have considered the arming of the slaves as a risky undertaking on the part of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>But the history of the war bears out <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00370.03905" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>'s confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>During the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> the contest lasted no negro outrage or disturbance, arising out of the circumstances, has to my knowledge been recorded, nor is it possible to deny that the total want of effervescense in the black population in times where every facility for revolt was afforded them, bears testimony to and throws a favorable light upon the way in which the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> was understood and put into practice in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/>On the other hand, it is impossible to admit that <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0290.0054.00370.03906" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> should have brooded over such a scheme as I have stated had he <pb id="p.371" n="371"/> not conceived at least the possibility of its adoption, and this points to the conclusion that the leading minds in the <rs>South</rs> were, to his knowledge, very far from identifying slavery, in the abstract, with the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>In corroboration of this inference I would recall:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/><num value="1">1</num>.

In it he tried to bribe the <rs>Southern States</rs> back into the <rs>Union</rs> by the promise of the maintenance of slavery, and failed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/><num value="2">2</num>.

In it he expressed the following sentiments (I quote from memory): <q direct="unspecified">There are some who talk of a return to the <rs>Union</rs> with slavery maintained, but who would thus sacrifice honor to interest.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/></p> 
<p>With this quotation I will close my narrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>The plain statement of facts it contains will, I have no doubt, convince any unbiased reader that the supposed scheme of a retrocession of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> never had any foundation in fact.
