<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>I propose to tell the story of the part of which I was a personal witness, or in regard to which I can bear peculiar testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>I shall treat his relations with the most prominent persons of the epoch, setting forth his opinions of them and his feelings toward them, and lift the veil from events of importance to history, or to the understanding of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0001.00011.00004" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s character and influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>I propose also to make known some of the circumstances of his Presidency and later career which have not hitherto been disclosed.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0001.00011.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> always knew that I contemplated writing his political history, and approved the intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>He promised me all the assistance he could give in its preparation, and refused his sanction to others who proposed a similar task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>During his last illness, when it became certain that his military memoir would be widely read, I urged him to attempt himself a political volume, and he consented to do so if I would aid him. The chapters I now offer will include material that would have formed part of such a memoir, whether it had been written by himself or had remained my work, supervised and corrected by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0001.00011.00006" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>To this <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> I shall add personal details too delicate to have been submitted to their subject, or to have been given to the world during his lifetime.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>My relations with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0001.00012.00007" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> began in <dateStruct value="1863-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">5th</day></dateStruct> of that month, immediately after crossing the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi River</placeName> in the <rs>Vicksburg</rs> campaign, he requested my appointment to duty on his staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>He had never seen me at the time, and made the application on the recommendation of <persName n="Wilson,General,James,H.,," id="n0262.0001.00012.00008" reg="default:Wilson,James,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, his inspector-general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I was then a captain serving on the staff of <persName n="Sherman,General,T.,W.,," id="n0262.0001.00012.00009" reg="default:Sherman,T.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n0262.0001.00012.00010" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>'s campaign against <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>My orders did not reach me till the <dateStruct value="-05-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, just as the assault on <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> was beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I was wounded in that assault, and unable to report to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0001.00012.00011" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> in person until the following <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I thus <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw him at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, where he had established his headquarters, after the <rs n="Battle of Chattanooga" type="battle">battle of Chattanooga</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Our relations at once became more than cordial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I was still on crutches, and he gave me a desk in his own room at headquarters, threw open his entire official correspondence to me, and delighted from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to tell me all the details of his battles and campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The bill creating the grade of lieutenant-general was then before Congress, and I had carried messages to him presaging its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He discussed the subject freely, told me he felt no anxiety for the promotion, and would take no step to secure it; but, if it came, he would do his best to fulfill the higher duties it imposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If otherwise, he would neither be disappointed nor in any way less devoted to the cause he served.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On the <dateStruct value="-03-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> he was ordered to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, and on the <num value="11" type="ordinal">11th</num> assumed command of the armies of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He at once assigned me to duty as military secretary, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel on his staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I remained with him in this capacity till the end of the war; went through the <rs>Wilderness</rs> campaign and the siege of <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by his side, and was present at the fall of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and the surrender of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0001.00013.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. During the next <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, those of the administration of <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n0262.0001.00013.00013" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, I was his confidential secretary and aide-de-camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I opened all his letters, answered many that were seen by no other man, and necessarily knew his opinions on most subjects closely and intimately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Wherever he went at this time I accompanied him. In his tour through the <rs>South</rs> after the close of the war, in his visit to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, his journey over the entire <rs>North</rs>, which was <num value="1">one</num> long triumphal procession; his stay at his little <placeName key="tgn,7015683" n="1.000 4" reg="galena, jo daviess, illinois">Galena</placeName> home; during the stormy days of Reconstruction and the struggle between Congress and the <rs>President</rs>; at the time of the removal of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0001.00013.00014" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,:4"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>; the impeachment of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0001.00013.00015" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>; the attempt to send <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0001.00013.00016" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> out of the country; in the <name>Presidential</name> campaign of <dateStruct value="1868--"><year reg="1868">1868</year></dateStruct>; down to the preparations for his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> administration, I was constantly in his society and confidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Enjoying these opportunities for knowing the man, and engaged at the time in writing his military history, I naturally took to studying his peculiar characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>For a long while he was just as much of an enigma to me as to the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The apparent absence of vanity, of ambition, of pride in his success, of selfishness, was so complete and so unusual in a man who had achieved such success, that I could not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> comprehend him. I soon, however, grew into a profound affection for him, which, enhanced by my admiration for his achievements, became the paramount feeling of my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>All my object and ambition were to help build up or illustrate his fame.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He appreciated this regard and, I thought, returned it with a warmth that he did not often display.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He allowed me to say things to him that few men say to each other, and at last he permitted me to see beneath the veil that concealed the mystery from mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I found him a man like other men, with feelings as profound as those of the most <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> passionate, but with a power of concealing them almost without example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>His reserve, however, was natural in part, as well as in part the result of intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At times there was a positive inability to reveal emotion, a sort of inarticulate undemonstrativeness as far as possible from stolidity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He had few affections, but these were intense; he did not hate many, but he could be implacable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He was not what is usually called ambitious, but after he had been long in power he was not insensible to the sweets of possession, and was decidedly averse to relinquishing what he had enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He was not vain, but he knew his own qualities, and, though he had the faculty of receiving adulation with a greater appearance of equanimity than any other human being I have known, he was not indifferent to the recognition of the world or the praises of his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He who never betrayed on that imperturbable countenance that he relished the plaudits of the multitude has told me often with delicious frankness afterward of the compliments he had received; he who seemed so careless of censure or criticism &mdash;after some little attempt at a speech of <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> lines, has looked around shyly as he sat down, and whispered: <q direct="unspecified">Was that all right?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The disclosure is no betrayal of his confidence, now that his modesty can no longer be pained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It cannot but make his calm and stalwart nature still more interesting to know that it covered the ordinary softnesses of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The living, breathing man is nearer to us than the statue of stone or unreal demi-<name n="God" type="God">god</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The <rs>Grant</rs> that I knew was full of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He had his weaknesses, but they made him more lovable sometimes to those who found them out; he had his faults, but to deny this would be to deny that he was mortal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I took a great delight in studying, not only his moral, but his intellectual qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He was not in the least a critic by nature; especially he was not introspective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But he was so sure of me that he was willing for me to explore his <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> nature, confident that I could find little to depreciate and nothing to dishonor him. I used to ask him how he came to do certain notable things, how the idea of some battle or campaign had been inspired or evolved in his mind, how he felt in a famous emergency; and he always tried to answer me. He.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>was curious himself when I suggested the inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It had never occurred to him to examine himself in this way, and he was not an expert; but he would tell me all that he could remember or understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>And I always found the same simple, unaffected nature underlying all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If he was unfair, and he was at times, he did not know it; he did not intend to be so. If his likes or dislikes affected his judgment, and they did, undoubtedly, it was unconsciously to himself; and he always wanted to atone for a wrong when he was convinced that he had inflicted <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But it was difficult to convince him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is, however, the intellectual side of him that is less understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I never saw anything more curious than his intellectual growth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>His faculties had never been exercised upon any large matters, or on any large scale until the war; then they expanded in the eminently practical career of a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>All his military greatness came of the plainest possible qualities, developed to an astounding degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The clearness of his judgment, the control of his emotions, his quick insight into a subject, his large grasp, his determined will&mdash;these are faculties that any <num value="1">one</num> might possess in an ordinary measure without exciting wonder, but these he carried into the most extraordinary circumstances, and applied on the grandest possible theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Notwithstanding all this, until the close of the war he had met few great men except soldiers, he had studied few great events except military ones, he knew few great subjects or situations, except battles and marches and sieges and campaigns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>When he went to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> and was thrown into contact with men trained in the political and social arena, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> he was very shy. He did not like the atmosphere; he was not at home in it. He avoided the world, so far as he, at the core and the top of the world, could avoid it. He disliked politics and society, but soon perceived that his duty and his position threw him into both politics and society, and though he never seemed to be observing, he watched closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He very soon conformed to etiquettes which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> had been, not only unfamiliar, but distasteful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He learned to understand the ways of men&mdash;and women&mdash;long used to arts and artifices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He never himself became a skillful simulator, but he could dissimulate as well as any man that ever lived; that is, he could prevent all but those who were absolutely closest to him, and sometimes these, from penetrating further than he wished into his thoughts or purposes or desires.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I had not seen him for several years when he visited <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and I was very much struck, at that time, with the growth and breadth of his intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I was with him at the tables of kings; I saw him in the company of the greatest <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> statesmen; at more than <num value="1">one</num> brilliant court; and he rose to an equality that the foremost recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>On his return to <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, I was again very much with him, almost, if possible, in a closer intimacy than ever before, and I was convinced that he had learned profoundly by his experience of the <name>Presidency</name> and his wonderful journey around the world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I saw him almost to the last, in his grim struggle with the greatest of all foes, and then too I recognized that the massive qualities of the man, though on so grand a scale, were after all, very human&mdash;the simple, natural traits that he shared with us all. He was a typical man, with his faults and virtues, only surpassing the rest by his achievements and his developed powers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is my intention to narrate the incidents and describe the conduct which produced in me this idea of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0001.00016.00017" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>. <pb id="p.17" n="17"/></p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>There was a determination on the part of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00030" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> to exclude the military authorities altogether from the final settlement, after submission should be secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>During <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00031" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s stay at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, prior to the final movements of the war, he had many conversations with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00032" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, but said nothing to indicate definitely what steps he intended to take at the close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Those steps were probably uncertain in his own mind, for, like all sagacious statesmen, he left much to be determined by circumstances as they might arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Even after the fall of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, when the end of the war was evidently at hand, when <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00033" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> came up and conferred for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00034" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in the captured town, there was no definite line laid down for the head of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00018.00035" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> only knew the general magnanimity of the <rs>President</rs>'s views and his disposition toward clemency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I make this statement from his own positive declarations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>So, also, it is within my knowledge that no subordinate, however great or however near, either knew or suggested <pb id="p.19" n="19"/> in advance the terms that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00036" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would impose on <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00037" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. This fact he has repeatedly stated to me. Matters of such consequence he never decided until the moment for decision came, and he never in his life arranged the details of any matter until it was presented to him for actual determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Thus, until he knew that he had the remains of the <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00038" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName> within his grasp, he did not reduce to form, even in his own mind, the exact conditions upon which he would allow it to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He had indeed long felt that when the war was ended there should be no vindictive policy toward the vanquished, and he informed <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00039" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> at once when they met that he meant to accept paroles; but the important final provision, that which gives all its peculiar character to the capitulation, was unstudied, and its language spontaneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Yet the language is as precise as words can make it, and enunciates a policy which has done as much as victory itself to secure the results of the war. <q direct="unspecified">Each officer and man will be allowed to return to his home, <hi rend="italics">not to be disturbed by <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authority</hi> so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they reside.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/></p> 
<p>The terms, however, were not in the least the result of chance, or carelessness, or indifference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>They were the legitimate outgrowth of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00040" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s judgment and feeling; the consequence of all that had gone before; embodied then for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, because then for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the necessity for the embodiment had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>In this way <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00041" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> always did his greatest things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It may be strange or inexplicable, but he could not often explain his methods, nor, indeed, always his reasons.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>He had at this moment no defined large views about separating the military from the civil power, far less any intent of encroaching on the domain or prerogative of politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>He did not even, like <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00019.00042" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,T.,W.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, take into consideration the fate or condition of other forces of the enemy, although he was <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>; he confined himself strictly <pb id="p.20" n="20"/> to the business before him&mdash;the disbanding and dispersion of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00043" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He wanted to secure that neither that army nor any of its members could ever again resist or confront the national authority; and when this was determined he was unwilling to inflict on <num value="1">one</num> of those members a single unnecessary humiliation or suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He was, I am sure, unconscious of any special magnanimity in this course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He thought nothing of himself, and little as yet of the farreach-ing effect of his terms on the population of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>What his hand found to do, it did, and no more; in peace as well as in war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The corroboration of all this is the fact that the idea of allowing the officers to retain their sidearms and personal effects was suggested to him as he wrote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>He wore no sword, having been summoned hastily from his own headquarters <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before to a distant portion of the field, with no opportunity of returning afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00044" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, however, had dressed himself with care for the ceremony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>His headquarters' train had been burned by <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00045" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:3"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> in the pursuit, and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00046" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his officers, able to save only a single suit of clothes, had secured the finest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In this way <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00047" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was handsomely clad; he wore embroidered gauntlets and the sword presented to him by the ladies of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The conqueror, battle-stained, in a common soldier's coat, looked up at his foe, elaborately arrayed, and the glitter of the rebel weapon suggested to him to spare the conquered the humiliation of surrendering it. Then he wrote the line permitting officers to retain their side-arms, horses, and personal effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>This statement has been questioned, but I give it on <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00048" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>He examined and corrected the account of the interview in my history of his campaigns.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>I stood near him as <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00020.00049" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> left the room, and thus happened to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to congratulate him upon the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>I said something about the event being <num value="1">one</num> that would live forever in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>I am sure the idea had not occurred to him until <pb id="p.21" n="21"/></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>I uttered it The effect upon his fame, upon history, was not what he was considering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>He was thinking of the captured soldiery returning home without their weapons, to work their little farms; of a destitute country, ravaged by law, but now to be restored.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>I talked with him that night when the others, tired with the marches and battles of the week, had gone to such beds as the camp provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I had been used to sit up with him late into the night, to write his letters or to keep him company, for he could not sleep early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Then he always talked with greater freedom than at any other time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>This night we spoke of the terms he had granted <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00021.00050" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. There were some of his officers who disliked the idea of the paroles, and thought at least the highest of the rebels should have been differently dealt with&mdash;held for trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>This was not my feeling, and I spoke of the effect his magnanimity was sure to have upon the country and the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>He was not averse to listen, and declared that he meant to maintain the compact no matter who opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>But <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00021.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, he said, was certain to be on his side.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The next day he met <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00021.00052" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> again at the picket lines between the armies, and the <num value="2">two</num> generals sat on their horses and discussed the condition of the <rs>South</rs> for hours, in sight of their soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00021.00053" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> assured <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00021.00054" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> of the profound impression the stipulations of the surrender had made upon his army, and declared that the entire <rs>South</rs> would respond to the clemency he had displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Scores of the captured officers had already visited <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0002.00021.00055" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, many of them his comrades at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, in the <rs>Mexican</rs> war, or on the <rs>Indian</rs> frontier, and thanked him for their swords, their liberty, and the immunity from civil prosecution which he had secured them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Later on the same day he set out for <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>He informed me in a private conversation of the purpose of my orders.

I was to be given duties that would lead me into contact with Southerners of importance, and among other tasks that of distributing food to the destitute was committed to me. <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 1" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">In Richmond</placeName>, at that time, every <num value="1">one</num> was destitute, and when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0262.0002.00022.00061" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> arrived from <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName> I had learned the condition of the city, and sent at once to inquire if I could furnish him and his staff with supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>He replied by an aide-de-camp that he was greatly obliged, and did not know what he should have done had the offer not been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>He wanted, indeed, to sell his horses, both to obtain money and because he had no forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>There was only <num value="1">one</num> way in which the food could be supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Congress had provided for such emergencies: printed tickets were prescribed, on the presentation of which what was called the <q direct="unspecified">destitute ration</q> was furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>A ticket for a destitute ration was accordingly made out for <persName n="Lee,General,Robert,E.,," id="n0262.0002.00022.00062" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and staff.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>dear Sir,&mdash;The apology for this letter, as well as its explanation, is to be found in the facts herein briefly presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I am now in confinement in this place and have been since the <dateStruct value="-05-25"><day reg="25">25th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Efforts are being made by friends to have me released on parole as others, arrested as I was, have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>You will excuse me for saying that I think I am as justly entitled to discharge on parole as many of those to whom I allude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>No man I think in the <rs>Southern States</rs> exerted his powers to a greater extent than I did to avert the late lamentable troubles of our country&mdash;no man strove harder or more earnestly to mitigate the evils and sufferings of war while it lasted, and to bring about a peaceful solution of the difficulties than I did&mdash;no man is less responsible for the beginning or continuance of the strife, with all its horrors, than I am&mdash;and no man living can more earnestly desire a speedy restoration of peace, harmony, and prosperity, throughout the country than I do. All these things I think I can assert of myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>But of my views and feelings under a very different aspect of affairs from what now exists you are not altogether uninformed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>You had them very fully expressed at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> last <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>You reported them very correctly in your telegram from that place to the <rs>Secretary</rs> of War&mdash;upon that telegram the conference at <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> was granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>When I parted with you on my return from that conference, I assured you, as you may recollect, that while nothing definite had been accomplished, yet I was in hopes that good would come of it. Such was my hope and earnest desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could have been more disappointed, mortified, and chagrined, at the result of his labors, in any undertaking than I was at the result of mine in that instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>I refer to this interview between us not only because of its pleasant reminiscences of a personal character, but as proof within your own knowledge of some things stated above in regard to my views and feelings at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The object of this letter, therefore, is simply to ask you, if entirely compatible with your own inclination, to lend the great weight of your name and influence with the <rs>President</rs>, the <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, for my release on parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>I have applied to the <rs>President</rs> for pardon and amnesty, but if he for any reason feels disposed to postpone the decision of that matter I am perfectly content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>What I desire mainly is a release from imprisonment on parole as others, or on bail if it should be required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>In no event would I attempt to avoid a prosecution or trial if it should be thought proper for any considerations to adopt such a course toward me. I wish a release from imprisonment on account both of my health and private affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>I might add that I think I could render some service in restoring harmony to the country; that, however, I leave for others to consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>But grave objections were offered to such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The Constitution had originally provided that the number of representatives should be apportioned to the population, adding in each State to the number of the free <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of those not free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>By this arrangement, though the slaves did not vote, the masters had the benefit of their numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>But the entire Southern population was now free, and would therefore be included in the basis for representation, though still the freedmen had no vote; so that emancipation actually increased very largely the number of representatives to which the <rs>South</rs> under the <rs>Constitution</rs> was entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>To this Congress would not agree; but <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0004.00034.00179" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> insisted <pb id="p.35" n="35"/> that the <name>States</name> which had revolted should be received back into the <rs>Union</rs> with their political power increased as the result of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>He claimed the right to pardon every man engaged in the <rs>Rebellion</rs> at his own individual will, and he took no care to protect the emancipated <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>At the beginning he may have undertaken his enterprise with patriotic motives, but he persisted after it was plain, not only that he was opposing those who had been his political allies, and had placed him in the <rs>Executive</rs> chair, but that he was offending the sentiment of the faithful <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The amendment was still to be submitted to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and every effort was made by the <name>Administration</name> to induce them to reject it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He had done nothing to induce the <rs>Northern</rs> people to come to their decision, but after the decision was made he used all his influence to prevail on the <rs>South</rs> to accept it. That influence with the <rs>South</rs> was very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The clemency he had shown them was not forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>His present power was not ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>No Southerner of importance at this time went to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> without presenting himself at <placeName><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00043.00230" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>, while many visited his house, and to all he proffered the same advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs> spoke very plainly; he declared to the delegates that he was their friend, and as their friend he warned them that the temper of the <rs>North</rs> was aroused, and if these terms were rejected harsher ones would be imposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>He argued and pleaded with them, and with every Southerner he met, for the sake of the <rs>South</rs>, for the sake of the entire country, for their own individual sakes, to conform to the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>He assured them that submission to the inevitable would secure a lightening of all that was really onerous in the conditions now proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/><pb id="p.44" n="44"/></p> 
<p>This conduct was in complete harmony with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00044.00234" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>It was the practical man who spoke, and who saw that worse remained behind if the <rs>South</rs> failed to submit now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Perhaps he did not want to see his own work undone, his clemency made subject for arraignment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Of course no such word was uttered to or by him, but he certainly never in his career appeared more anxious or ardent in any task than in his efforts now to induce the <rs>South</rs> to accept the terms which he believed the easiest the <rs>North</rs> would ever offer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>dear General,&mdash;Your letter of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> is just received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>My letter to Pride, with which this is enclosed, answers a part of yours.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>The day after you left here the <rs>President</rs> sent for me, as I expected he would after my conversation with the AttorneyGen-eral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>I told him my views candidly about the course I thought he should take, in view of the verdict of the late elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It elicited nothing satisfactory from him, but did not bring out the strong opposition he sometimes shows to views not agreeing with his own. I was followed by <persName n="Sickles,General,,,," id="n0262.0005.00044.00238" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sickles</surname></persName>, who expressed about the same opinion I did.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Since that I have talked with several members of Congress who are classed with the <name>Radicals</name>; <persName n="Schenck,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00044.00239" reg="mostcommon:Schenck,nomatch:0"><surname>Schenck</surname></persName> and <persName n="Bidwell,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00044.00240" reg="mostcommon:Bidwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bidwell</surname></persName> for instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They express the most generous views as to what would be done if the constitutional amendments proposed by Congress <pb id="p.45" n="45"/> were adopted by the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>What was done in the case of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> was an earnest of what would be done in all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Even the disqualification to hold office imposed on certain classes by <num value="1">one</num> article of the amendment would, no doubt, be removed at once, except it might be in the cases of the very highest offenders, such, for instance, as those who went abroad to aid in the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, those who left seats in Congress, etc. All or very nearly all would soon be restored, and so far as security to property and liberty is concerned, all would be restored at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>I would like exceedingly to see <num value="1">one</num> Southern State, excluded State, ratify the amendments to enable us to see the exact course that would be pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>I believe it would much modify the demands that may be made if there is delay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Yours truly, </p><closer><signed><persName n="Grant,,U.,S.,," id="n0262.0005.00045.00241" reg="expanded:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><foreName>U.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</signed> <salute>To <persName n="Taylor,General,R.,,," id="n0262.0005.00045.00242" reg="expanded:Taylor,Richard,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>.</salute></closer></body></text></p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>But the <rs>President</rs>'s endeavors did not cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>His was <num value="1">one</num> of those tempers which opposition aggravates, and he became at last violent in his obstinacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>He went over entirely to those whom he had fought for a lifetime; he made political bedfellows of his bitterest enemies, and of those who had been the avowed enemies of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>He used all the authority of his office to dissuade the <name>Southerners</name> from accepting the amendment which the entire <rs>North</rs> had ratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>His counsels proved more than pernicious, for the <name>Southerners</name> were dazzled by the fallacious hope of obtaining all that he promised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>They forgot that they had been conquered and were still at the mercy of the conquerors, and assumed the airs of wronged and outraged claimants; they acted as if they were already equals in that Union which they had attempted to destroy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>They, however, were far less to blame than the injudicious and ill-tempered man whom Fate had placed at this critical moment at the head of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Human nature can hardly be expected to resist such overtures as he proposed, to put away the chance of escaping the penalties they had expected, and <pb id="p.46" n="46"/> obtaining the prizes they had thought beyond their reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>None the less, the result was lamentable, both then and afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>All the long series of misfortunes and dangers to the country that followed are directly traceable to the influence or action of <num value="1">one</num> man. He perverted the inclinations and intentions of the <rs>South</rs>, and by reflex those of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>He converted good feeling and good will on both sides into discord, and precipitated disasters almost equal to those from which the <rs>State</rs> had barely escaped&mdash;disasters the full effect of which is even yet not past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>This view of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00243" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s conduct was thenceforth steadily maintained by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00244" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Without knowledge that he held this view his conduct cannot be appreciated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> at last became, if not treasonable in intent, yet unpatriotic in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>He fostered a spirit that engendered massacre, and afterward protected the evil-doers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>He spoke, both with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00245" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in private and openly to the public, as if the <rs>Congress</rs> elected by the faithful States was an illegal body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>He suggested to men's minds that he might be plotting to allow the <name>Southerners</name> to return to their places in spite of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>He made use of his right to command the army in a way that awoke suspicion in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00246" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and although at this time he committed no illegal act, and possibly uttered no word commanding or directly advocating such an act, there can be no doubt that but for his knowledge of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00247" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s determination not to play into his hands, he would have attempted what those who had conquered would have considered treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00248" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> frequently expressed this belief to those in his confidence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Believing thus <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00046.00249" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> acted not only with moderation and firmness, but with a tact which was hardly usual in him, but which circumstances seemed to develop because it was supremely necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>He avoided offending, and he never disobeyed the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>There was still no open rupture, no appearance of difference before the public; and at the <pb id="p.47" n="47"/> very time when many at the <rs>North</rs> suspected <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00047.00250" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> of favoring the <rs>President</rs>'s views, he was in reality doing more than all the country besides to thwart <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00047.00251" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>But he thought it prudent not to alarm or provoke the nation by disclosing his fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>This was, indeed, far more than tact, it was political and patriotic wisdom.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>And his course throughout all these proceedings was entirely his own. He listened to the advice, or opinions, or persuasions of those who felt they had a right to offer either, but every decision was the result of his own judgment, of his own instinct of what was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>He seemed to me at the time greater than in any emergency of the war, and when I look back upon both crises now, I remain of this opinion still.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>During these contentions Congress created, or rather revived, the grade of General in the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> for <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0005.00047.00252" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>immediately before the elections which were to give the verdict of the country upon <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00257" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s policy a violent political discussion arose in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, where it was well known that a spirit had existed as hostile to the <rs>Union</rs> as in New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>There seemed danger of a collision between the <rs>State</rs> authorities, which were friendly to <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00258" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and those of the <rs type="place">City of Baltimore</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The Governor appealed to the <rs>President</rs> for armed assistance, and <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00259" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> made several attempts to induce <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00260" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to order <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>He held numerous conversations with the <rs>President</rs>, and though no disloyal proposition was made to him in words, he conceived a profound distrust of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00262" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>This feeling was shared by <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00263" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>In the excited state of feeling aroused by <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00264" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s course the use of troops was certain to prove exasperating, and it seemed to be the <rs>President</rs>'s purpose to tempt or provoke his opponents to some illegal act which would warrant a resort to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>It was too soon after a civil war to incur such risks without alarm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Grant at once protested verbally but earnestly against sending troops to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>But the <rs>President</rs> persisted in his suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>He did not give the order, for he frequently used all the weight of his position to induce <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00049.00265" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to act as he desired, yet failed to assume the responsibility of issuing a positive command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>He saw both parties to the dispute, persuaded them to leave the decision to the courts, and averted the danger&mdash;as signal a service as he had often rendered the country in the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>This entire proceeding caused him as much solicitude as any Presidential action of the period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Occurring immediately before the elections which were to pronounce upon <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00050.00271" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s policy, it had peculiar significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>For a while the <rs>President</rs> almost insisted on sending troops into a region that had been disaffected, and where the very authorities that he wished to support by arms had been of doubtful loyalty during the war. He suggested to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00050.00272" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in writing that there was <q direct="unspecified">a turbulent disposition which might assume insurrectionary proportions,</q> and that it was <q direct="unspecified">the duty of the <rs>Government</rs> to be prepared to act with force and decision.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>But he meant to act <q direct="unspecified">with force</q> against men who had fought for the <rs>Union</rs> and in support of those who had fought against it. <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00050.00273" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> believed that <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00050.00274" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> would be glad to put those who opposed his policy into the position of rebels, while the <name>Southerners</name> who supported it would seem to be loyal to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The crafty scheme was never developed, but the watchful, skillful, anxious care of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00050.00275" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> may have had more to do with its prevention than any lack of will on the part of the <rs>President</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>He was as anxious to frustrate <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00051.00278" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s manoeuvres as he had ever been to thwart those of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00051.00279" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>. In each instance he was uncertain of the strategy of the enemy, but he fought what he believed to be the enemy's plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>He never changed his opinion afterward, but remained convinced that had opportunity offered <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0006.00051.00280" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> would have attempted some disloyal artifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>my dear General,&mdash;As yet no decision has been given by the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> on the subject of the right of District Commanders to remove civil officers and appoint their successors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>It is likely, however, that he will give attention to that subject and all other questions submitted to him arising under the <name>Reconstruction</name> act, as soon as he is through with the <rs>Mississippi</rs> motion to file a bill <pb id="p.66" n="66"/> of injunction against certain parties to restrain them from executing the laws of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>In the meantime I would advise that in case any of the civil officers obstruct the laws they be suspended and tried by military commissions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>This right certainly does exist on the part of District Commanders, and I have no doubt myself on the subject of their power to remove arbitrarily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The lawmakers clearly contemplated providing military governments for the rebel States until they were fully restored, in all their relations, to the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>They evidently only recognized present State governments as provisional, for convenience, to be made use of by District Commanders, just so far as they could be used in carrying out the will of Congress, and no further.</p></body></text></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important matters under the new law was the registration of voters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>This was to include all male citizens, without distinction of race, color, or previous condition&mdash;except such as had been disfranchised for participation in the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, or for felony at common law; and every quibble was at once resorted to at the <rs>South</rs> and indorsed by <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0008.00066.00381" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, to secure the registration of those whom Congress had intended to disfranchise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>The subject was constantly coming up before the <rs>District Commanders</rs>, who promptly referred all intricate points to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0008.00066.00382" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>On the subject of who can register under the law, I think it was the intention to exclude only those who are excluded from holding office under the <name>Constitutional</name> amendment, and those who have previously been disfranchised for infamous crimes, such as were recognized before the <rs>Rebellion</rs> as sufficient cause for disfranchisement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The supplementary bill, particularly the oath prescribed to be taken before registration, would seem to provide for the disfranchisement of a <pb id="p.67" n="67"/> class of citizens that ought always to be disfranchised in every community, for their gross violation of law, and could not have been intended as a further punishment, or the punishment of other classes, for the crime of treason against the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>By the same rule of judging I do not think that a class of citizens who heretofore have not had the elective franchise can be excluded for acts which would not have disfranchised them had they possessed the privilege of voting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>I give this only as my views on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Because he did not speak was no reason to suppose he did not think or feel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>It seemed to him immodest to uncloak himself to the world, or even entirely to his most intimate friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>He could not, if he would, expose his opinions and sentiments to every <num value="1">one</num> he met. He was indignant at those who sought to penetrate further than he chose to allow, and kept back something from them who got closest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>He had secrets of business from <num value="1">one</num> friend, of politics from another, of feeling from many; and no <num value="1">one</num> knew all.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>After the <rs>Supplementary Act</rs> was passed he entered upon a phase of his career that required all the forbearance, sagacity, and skill of which he was master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>He was a subordinate of the <rs>President</rs>, yet had been made in some degree independent of him. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> was naturally indignant at the situation, which was indeed anomalous, and even unjustifiable, except on the ground that it was indispensable <pb id="p.75" n="75"/> in order to save the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>But Congress believed the <rs>President</rs> not only hostile to the true interests of the country, but recusant to the expressed will of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>The era was indeed revolutionary and the circumstances unprecedented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>The time was out of joint, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0009.00075.00431" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> felt that it was his unwelcome task to set it right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>It was made his duty both by law and by patriotism to carry out a policy which the <rs type="place">Head</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> sought by every means to defeat and destroy; and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0009.00075.00432" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> determined to perform the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Nevertheless, he succeeded even yet in maintaining the appearance of amicable relations with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>He showed him all the deference due his office, and was able to postpone for a while longer the fiercest phases of that hostility which was destined to break out at last between the <rs>Executive</rs> and Congress.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>His equanimity of temper was as important at this juncture as either his steadfastness or unselfishness of purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>He had no anxiety except to do his duty and save his whole country, <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, from further peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>He felt that it was as important not to inflame passion as to carry out a policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>He was as careful not to exasperate <name>North</name> or <name>South</name> as to perform any other service to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>A word from him would have excited Congress beyond its own control; an appeal to the <rs>North</rs> might have precipitated another war. But he kept to himself, or to the very few in whom he confided, his knowledge of many exasperating words and deeds; he cautioned his subordinates; he strove to hold in check the hot-heads in Congress, so that even yet there were Republicans who doubted him and only used him because he was a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>He felt especially&ndash;I often heard him declare it&mdash;extreme reluctance to the use of arbitrary power at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>He was republican in principle and democratic in sentiment, if ever a man was either, and he took no arbitrary step, except unwillingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>But he felt that the emancipated <num value="1000000">millions</num> must be protected, that the recently <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> hostile population must be held in check, if necessary with the curb; and though he was anxious to appease passion, to harmonize, if yet possible, the legislative and executive branches of the <rs>Government</rs>, to preserve the democratic principle, to retain his own magnanimous feeling toward the conquered, he was firm, and if needful stern, in holding all that had been acquired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>He treated those who had been rebels with justice as well as mercy; he was determined to protect the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black Unionists</rs>; he would carry out the law, even in spite of its highest officer, his own superior.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>He thus went heartily into the spirit of the reconstruction measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>He advised the removal of all Southern functionaries who were not really anxious to renew their allegiance, but at the same time urged the remission of the penalties of treason in the case of those who proved themselves repentant, or at least loyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>He counseled his subordinate commanders constantly and watched them closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>But he took care not to transcend his powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>His letters to these officers are full of anxiety not to overstep his own limitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>But up to this time the <rs>District Commanders</rs> without exception took his advice as orders.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Under this wise and really pacific management the evil spirit at the <rs>South</rs> was almost laid; murder became less common, justice more frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>The population itself declared its satisfaction with military rule, its preference for this to any now practicable government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>It liked, indeed, to call itself conquered, and hugged its hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>In many States the registration of the new voters began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>It was an old question, and had arisen in the days of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00515" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>; it came up again, or something like it, after <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00516" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had ceased to be <rs type="role" reg="General">General</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>There was always, however, a sort of personal barrier between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00519" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> respected profoundly the services <rs>Stanton</rs> had rendered the country, and I doubt not the sentiment was reciprocated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>But <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00520" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> was harsh and austere in manner, and apparently cared little for the feelings of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>He doubtless had his affections and his intimacies, but <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00521" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was included in neither; and at times the harshness was extended even to him, probably without intent, perhaps unconsciously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>But <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00522" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was in reality <num value="1">one</num> of the most sensitive of men. He regarded the feelings of others carefully, and it was always painful to him to inflict pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Although few supposed so, he felt acutely all the censures and attacks and even the slights of which he was the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>He said nothing, perhaps, when he received them, but there was abundant evidence, which those who were with him closely could detect, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00081.00523" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was a thinskinned <pb id="p.82" n="82"/> man. Therefore these asperities of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00082.00524" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> wounded him. He was in no way elated at his own success and his honors, but he was nevertheless conscious that he had done good service to the country; he knew that he occupied a dignified position before the world; and the attention and consideration he received were far from disagreeable to him. When in the midst of all this, <num value="1">one</num> man roughly asserted or implied a superiority, sent for <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00082.00525" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> as he would for a lieutenant, or allowed his orders as <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs> to remain for days unapproved, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00082.00526" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was touched, as any other human being would have been under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>He did not, indeed, resent what he disliked, for <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00082.00527" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> never transcended his technical rights&mdash;though he sometimes approached the verge&mdash;but the recollection remained and produced a permanent impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Thus without any absolute variance ever occurring, and while on all important matters the <num value="2">two</num> were in complete harmony, their personal intercourse was never familiar, and hardly agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>I do not believe either ever enjoyed the other's society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>But they were true patriots and earnest men. The moment a question of duty to the country or to each other was involved, all this petty unrevealed sentiment was ignored or trampled on. To my mind their behavior to each other was finer than if they had been warmly and personally attached.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>I must add <num value="1">one</num> remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>As I look back upon these matters now, with all my partiality for my personal chief, I am convinced that while <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00082.00528" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> was undoubtedly lacking in delicacy and perhaps withheld some of the consideration to which <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0010.00082.00529" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was entitled, he doubtless believed that he was asserting an important principle&mdash;the superiority of the civil over the military arm, the doctrine that even a victorious <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs> is, under our institutions, the subordinate of the executive branch of the <rs>Government</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>But these were absolutely the only points on which the soldier and the <rs>Secretary</rs> had ever differed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>This was in consequence of an agreement he had made with <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00086.00561" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> that he should be summoned in this way, if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>In considering the behavior of both <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00086.00563" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00086.00564" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> at this period it must be borne in mind that this was no ordinary political crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>It was not a struggle for office, or a contest about a tariff or a bankrupt law in which they were engaged, but a dispute that followed hard on a terrible civil war. It was the reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> that was at issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>The question was whether the <name>States</name> that had seceded and the population that had rebelled should be re-admitted to their former place with or without the stipulations and restrictions which the victors had decided to demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>More than this, the hopes held out by <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00086.00565" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> of easier terms had revived the ambition and disturbed the quiet of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Naturally, after a great and disastrous convulsion there were many perturbed spirits, some perhaps ready to seize any opportunity to recover what they had lost; there was a population of <num value="1000000">millions</num> recently set free, living among their former <pb id="p.87" n="87"/> masters; there were the <name>Unionists</name> of the <rs>South</rs> in the midst of the unsuccessful Confederates; there was every cause for anxiety, every passion and sentiment to be appeased and allayed and controlled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>All these seething elements of disorder were stirred up by <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00566" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s obstinacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The Southerners would have submitted to the inevitable, but he encouraged and incited them to hold out still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>If the decision of the <rs>North</rs> was accepted by the <rs>South</rs>, there would be an end of the trouble, but by the stimulating conduct of the <rs>President</rs>, by his incessant public and private provocations and persuasions and exhortations, he prolonged the struggle and made worse things probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>It was the apprehension of still further confusion and re-awakened strife that made the situation so critical, and justified <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00567" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00568" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> to themselves in their anomalous and extraordinary course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>They believed that by steadily carrying out the will of Congress and of the people in spite of the <rs>President</rs> they would put an end to the chaos, and bring back peace and the <rs>Union</rs> on the only terms which the victorious <rs>North</rs> would tolerate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>This feeling of his subordinates was of course known to the <rs>President</rs>, and it was no secret that he wished to rid himself of his War <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>But the friends of Congress, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00569" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> among them, counseled <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00570" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> not to resign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>It was feared, however, that <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00571" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> would peremptorily dismiss the <persName n="Minister,Cabinet,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00572" reg="mostcommon:Minister,Young,,,:1"><roleName n="Cabinet">Cabinet</roleName> <surname>Minister</surname></persName>, who was no longer in his confidence, and Congress took extraordinary means to prevent this action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>The well-known Tenure of Office bill was devised in order to make it impossible for <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00573" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> to remove subordinates who were not in harmony with his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> naturally desired to have only his own supporters in office at such a crisis, while Congress was determined that those whom <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00087.00574" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had appointed should not be displaced by the successor who had certainly betrayed his party, and who they thought was ready to betray his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>So <pb id="p.88" n="88"/> the law was passed, against the protestations and over the veto of the <rs>President</rs>, prohibiting him, without the approval of the <name>Senate</name>, from removing officers whose confirmation required the <orgName n="Senate" type="government">Senate</orgName>'s approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>The rule was extended, with certain restrictions, to members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>; and the <rs>President</rs> was not allowed to dismiss a Minister until the end of his term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>He was at liberty, however, during the recess of Congress, to suspend any officer for cause, but must report the case to the <name>Senate</name> when it re-assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>If, then, the <name>Senate</name> concurred, the officer was dismissed; if not, he was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>This law, it was matter of notoriety, had especial reference to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>It was passed in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and Congress adjourned on the <dateStruct value="-07-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>He also stated that he meant to appoint <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00579" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> ad interim</hi>. There could be no possible doubt of the purpose of this move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>It was intended to nullify as far as possible the action of Congress, to punish men for striving to execute the law, to hinder the <name>Reconstruction</name> policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/><persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00580" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> could hardly have hoped to accomplish much by putting <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00581" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00582" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>Still the soldier was less unbending in manner than the <rs>Secretary</rs>, less uncompromising in the appearance of hostility; and his military habit of subordination may even yet have misled the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>He certainly was less skilled in the arts of political chicanery, and <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00583" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> may have thought it possible still to inveigle or overreach him. But the especial object doubtless was, not so much to manage <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00584" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> as to affect the people, to produce the impression on the country that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00088.00585" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was in accord with the <name>Administration</name>, and that by entering the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at this crisis he was offering proof of his sympathy with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/><pb id="p.89" n="89"/></p> 
<p>There was also doubtless a personal reason why <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00089.00586" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> wished to foster this idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>It was plain by this time that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00089.00587" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s popularity was likely to make him a Presidential candidate, and the belief that he sustained <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0011.00089.00588" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> would destroy his hold upon the <name>Republicans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>This would naturally antagonize the <name>Republicans</name>, while, with the <rs>President</rs>'s party, the <rs>President</rs> himself of course was chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1395"/>The interview lasted perhaps half an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1396"/>But the next day <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01189" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> was acquitted, and <persName n="Wade,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01190" reg="nearbymention:Wade,Benjamin,F.,,"><surname>Wade</surname></persName> never made a Cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1397"/>He got very close to greatness; the vote of <num value="1">one</num> man in the <name>Senate</name> excluded him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1398"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01191" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> very much disappointed at the result of the trial, and said so to some of his intimates; but he was discreet, and forebore to make his feeling public or its expression in any way indecorous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1399"/>After a while his judgment changed, and he thought on the whole it was better for the country that the <rs>President</rs> should not have been removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1400"/>He believed that <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01192" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had been taught a lesson which he would not forget, and that the precedent of a successful impeachment would have been a greater misfortune to the <rs>State</rs> than any evil that <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01193" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> might still have been able to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1401"/>In addition to this I heard him say that a fear of <persName n="Wade,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01194" reg="nearbymention:Wade,Benjamin,F.,,"><surname>Wade</surname></persName>'s well-known bitterness and lack of restraint reconciled him more easily to enduring <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01195" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> a little longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1402"/>He even suggested that a similar apprehension might have influenced some of the <rs>Republican Senators</rs> who had voted for acquittal.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1403"/>As years went by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01196" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s judgment changed on several points in regard to which at this time he was very decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1404"/>He found the <name>Tenure</name> of Office act a great obstruction to his own authority as <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and was anxious for a much greater modification of its provisions than Congress was willing to concede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1405"/>Yet he had been strongly in favor of curtailing <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00137.01197" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1406"/>He justified this apparent inconsistency by declaring that the times had been unusual, <pb id="p.138" n="138"/> the man exceptional; and that what was indispensable immediately after a great civil convulsion in order to prevent further commotions and possibly revolution, was unnecessary and indefensible in the ordinary years of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1407"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01198" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> indeed was never willing to let constitutional restrictions bind the <rs>State</rs> so that it could not save itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1408"/>He was full of reverence for law, but that the <name>Sabbath</name> was made for man, and not man for the <name>Sabbath</name>, was a doctrine to which in all things he subscribed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1409"/>He was heartily glad when the turmoil of the impeachment was over, and was entirely satisfied to have a prominent Republican like <persName n="Evarts,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01199" reg="mostcommon:Evarts,William,M.,,:1"><surname>Evarts</surname></persName> accept a seat in <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01200" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s Cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1410"/>There were many in his party who disapproved the course of <persName n="Evarts,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01201" reg="mostcommon:Evarts,William,M.,,:1"><surname>Evarts</surname></persName> at this juncture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1411"/>They were indignant even that he should defend the <rs>President</rs> professionally, and still more so when he consented to become a member of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01202" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1412"/>But <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01203" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself had set the precedent, and could not condemn the man who followed it. Both he and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01204" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> had held places in the same Cabinet while disapproving the policy of its chief; and he thought and said that <persName n="Evarts,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01205" reg="mostcommon:Evarts,William,M.,,:1"><surname>Evarts</surname></persName>, especially as the legal adviser of the <name>Administration</name>, might be able to act as a useful check, and thus do the country important service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1413"/>He was glad also to have <num value="1">one</num> man in the <rs>Cabinet</rs> with whom in most matters he could sympathize.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1414"/>The result of the trial was a crushing and intolerable blow to <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n0262.0016.00138.01206" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, from which he never recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1433"/>I have already shown <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00141.01230" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s original aversion to politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1434"/>Immediately after the close of the war, the attention of the country was turned to the great soldier as a probable candidate for the <name>Presidency</name>, but to him nothing could be more disagreeable than the thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1435"/>Probably no man has ever been mentioned for the place who was more unwilling to accept the honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1436"/>He was plain and unassuming, for all his elevation, entirely satisfied with his position at the head of the army, and gratified with his personal popularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1437"/>He had received no training in politics, and possessed no aptitude for the career; he disliked the ways and arts of politicians, and preferred his soldier friends and his reputation as a soldier to political associates or political fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1438"/>He knew, too, that he must lose some of his popularity when he became a candidate, must give up much of his ease and offend many of his friends when once he entered office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1439"/>Besides all this, he had tasted the bitterness of poverty, and he was now placed beyond pecuniary anxiety, while, if he became <rs type="role2">President</rs>, he must relinquish the income of <measure n="22000dollars" type="currency">$22,000</measure> a year that was settled on him for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1440"/>He had little to look forward to afterward, no resources to take the place of those he would lose; and he was still young,&mdash;only <num value="43">forty-three</num> when the war closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1441"/>He considered all these circumstances, and he told me afterward that he looked with positive apprehension at the probability, which by degrees <pb id="p.142" n="142"/> was converted into a certainty, of becoming a Presidential candidate.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1442"/>When he was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> approached on the subject he resented the liberty and repelled all discussion of the theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1443"/>I have often seen men who hoped to draw him out receive very mortifying and unexpected rebuffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1444"/>They would make, perhaps, an elaborate little speech, devise a snare into which they thought he must certainly fall, invent a bait that must tempt him to talk; but <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00142.01231" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would simply look at them with no expression whatever on his face, and say not a single word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1445"/>If he had uttered anything at all they might have continued or renewed their wiles, but this absolute silence was the most embarrassing answer possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1446"/>It not only entirely baffled them, but was merciless in its way. They stammered and blushed, no matter how bold or adroit; then they attempted to change the subject, and invariably, before many minutes, took their leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1447"/>Sometimes, as the door closed, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00142.01232" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would look up at me with a quizzical expression that showed he enjoyed their confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1448"/>For a man unused to the stratagems of peace he was the most skillful and the most successful in these repulses I have ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1449"/>His interlocutors never returned to the charge.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1450"/>But the course of <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00142.01233" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> made it incumbent at last on the soldier to accept the political situation, however unwelcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1451"/>The people whom he had led in the war naturally looked to him to guard what he had won, and for a year before the actual necessity for decision there could be no mistaking the signs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1452"/>Still <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00142.01234" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> lived in the hope that the necessity might be averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1453"/>He would not admit to himself that he must take up the new role.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1454"/>The approach of the crisis awoke no ambition in him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1457"/>This repugnance doubtless helped him to conceal so long his differences with the <rs>President</rs>, and made him submit to more from <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00143.01242" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> than he otherwise would have endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1458"/>Then, too, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0017.00143.01243" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Stanton,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> saw not a little in the conduct of Congress and of individual members of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> which he did not commend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1459"/>Of course, with the general policy of the party he was in accord, but he disapproved many particulars and disliked many men that, as a candidate, he must in some sort indorse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1460"/>Besides all this, he had many admirers and some warm personal friends among the <name>Democrats</name> whom he was unwilling to lose, and the influence of his wife's family, which went for something, was decidedly hostile to the <rs>Republican</rs> policy and sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1461"/>Thus he deferred to the last moment taking the decisive step.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1474"/>At that moment I believe he was sorry to leave his position in the army, and disliked as much as ever the prospect of new responsibilities and unfamiliar cares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1475"/>But of course, when he was in a fight he desired to win, and since his name had been placed before the public with his tacit sanction, he would have been disappointed had he not received the nomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/>He became absolutely a politician afterward, but only this idea will account for much that was extraordinary in his course, both during the canvass and even after the election.

All who approach <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> or Presidents-elect say what they think will please them and withhold what will displease; all have something to ask, if only recognition, for the recognition of <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> is itself an honor; and most people want much more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>This is the explanation of the distance at which he kept not only the public and the press, but political and personal friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>I was amazed at the tone of his conversation; he did not expect, he said, to enjoy the influence he had once anticipated, but even the few favors he asked had been withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>The personal friends he had expected to advance were overlooked, or their claims belittled, if not ignored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>His early life he has himself described as that of plain people at the <rs>West</rs> <num value="50">fifty</num> or <measure n="60years" type="date">sixty years</measure> ago. He received, however, the advantages of <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> and its associations, and officers of the army in those days were considered eligible to any company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>At <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> he married into a family that held itself as high as any in the old society of that semi-Southern city; a society which was undoubtedly at that time provincial and narrow; its members had seen or known little of any world but their own, but the feeling they had that their position was equal to any gave them a certain distinction of bearing that nothing else could confer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>It was not a highly educated society, and resembled in some points the squirearchy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> that <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n0262.0020.00170.01550" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName> describes; elevated in feeling though contracted in acquirement, and if over-conscious of its own consequence, nevertheless never meeting anybody of more consequence than its own members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>Many of these he shared by nature, others he acquired, but others he always repudiated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>He was, as all the world knows, simple in his tastes and habits, and at <num value="1">one</num> time unacquainted with many of the etiquettes and requirements of an artificial society; not a few of which, indeed, he disliked after he became familiar with <pb id="p.171" n="171"/> them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>Forms and ceremonies were always distasteful to him, and though he complied with such as his position rendered unavoidable, he escaped from them in private as speedily and as effectually as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>But the very simplicity of taste and feeling, the plainness of manner that he preserved in his extraordinary elevation, were proof of a native and genuine refinement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/>When he arrived at the capital to receive the command of the armies he was shy and reserved in general company: of course never timid, but he was aware of his deficiencies in social knowledge, and the consciousness made him constrained and sometimes awkward under the honors and congratulations that were heaped upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/>Nevertheless he conformed to many observances which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he had found irksome as well as unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>It was some little time before he consented to wear an evening coat, and the white tie especially was a disagreeable novelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>But he soon discovered that he made himself more conspicuous by avoiding the dress that others wore than by adopting <pb id="p.174" n="174"/> it; and when he ascertained the importance attributed to visits in the official and high political world in which he lived, he became anxious that they should be paid and returned punctiliously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>In time it was he who urged <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0020.00174.01576" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to make her calls, and those who did not know would hardly believe how particular he grew about placing people at dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>Not that he regarded these points as important, but others did, whom he was unwilling to neglect or to offend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>So too about his parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>He was always willing to open his house, and wanted no <num value="1">one</num> left out whom it was proper to invite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/>He had indeed a genuine liking for society; not only because wherever he went he was the chief and the idol, though this might make any <num value="1">one</num> fond of the world; but he was social by nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>He not only had a pleasure in the company of his intimates, not only enjoyed the conversation of important men; but he liked to look at pretty girls and to listen to the talk of clever women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>For a long time, however, he was not ready in replying; he had little small talk, and could not make conversation without a theme; but he observed closely under his mask of silence, and I always relished his criticisms of people and manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>He gossiped very genially, and observed little points of behavior and their significance as acutely as many of long experience in what is called <q direct="unspecified">the world.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/>I had a great deal to do with his early social career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/>Sometimes in the crowd the aides-de-camp thrust out their hands and saved him many <pb id="p.175" n="175"/> a squeeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>He possessed the <q direct="unspecified">royal</q> memory of faces, and when at his own house or headquarters any of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> called whom he had met before, he always remembered the names which we who had stood beside him were often unable to recall.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>For years his unwillingness to make a speech was curious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>When he was nominated for the <name>Presidency</name>, he declared he had neither the power of public speaking nor the disposition to acquire it. In the long series of ovations that followed him everywhere after the close of the war not more than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> words were ever extorted from him in reply to encomiums and even adulation such as few men have ever heard addressed to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/>I was once traveling with him by railroad during the height of his early popularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>Wherever the train stopped it was surrounded by ardent and patriotic throngs.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>Years afterward I thought of this scene in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> when I heard <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0020.00176.01591" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> at a great table in the <name>Guildhall</name> at <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> address a brilliant company in felicitous language that evoked cheers of admiration from some of the acutest critics of eloquence in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>For he certainly acquired the art of putting <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> appropriate thoughts into fitting language on such occasions in as high degree as any <num value="1">one</num> I ever listened to. His replies were models not only of terse and modest expression, but of epigrammatic force and fluent wit, timely in suggestiveness, personal in application, and almost always conveying a wise as well as graceful sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>Indeed, the shyness and awkwardness that were so apparent at the beginning of his career had passed completely away before the end. Perhaps a little lingered until he became <rs type="role2">President</rs>, but the sense of the greatness of his position that came to him then took away all shyness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>He was not only the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wherever he went, but the <rs>Chief</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>, and he felt that the <rs>Government</rs> was upon his shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>There was no personal vanity implied in maintaining or even in asserting such a dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>In small things as well as great this feeling was apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>He never entered the street-cars while he was <rs type="role2">President</rs>, although often before he had mortified his staff and his family by using the democratic conveyance; he was careful whom he visited, and regarded etiquette scrupulously in this matter; he selected the company and <pb id="p.177" n="177"/> arranged the precedence at his dinners, frequently disappointing relatives and intimate friends who saw themselves displaced on public occasions for public dignitaries, though in his private life he returned to his former associates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year of his Presidency I spent <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> on duty at the <rs>Executive Mansion</rs>, where, although I was no longer the official secretary, I had my own room and saw him with much of my old intimacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>I revised with him and for him his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> annual message to Congress, and <persName n="Ministers,Cabinet,,,," id="n0262.0020.00177.01592" reg="mostcommon:Ministers,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Cabinet">Cabinet</roleName> <surname>Ministers</surname></persName> came to me to have passages inserted which they did not venture themselves to propose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>Thus I watched the growth of the new manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>I observed a greater dignity of feeling, a conscious and intentional gravity, an absence of that familiar, almost jocular mood which once had been so frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>And yet he did not forget, much less repel, his former friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>They were what they had always been to him, just as worthy, perhaps just as intimate as ever, and the very few were certainly as dear; but he was the <rs>President</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>The great changes, however, were more apparent later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> year of his Presidency I was made <rs type="role" reg="Consul-General">Consul-General</rs> at <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and I saw him afterward on only <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> occasions during a short visit to this country until the close of his last Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/>In this interval had come all the storm of calumny that burst upon him, all the anxieties of the last sad year of his official life, all the falsity of friends, the attacks upon his honor, the injury he received from the association of those who used and abused his name and his friendship for their own purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>Besides all this there was of course the increase of years, the long occupancy of the highest place, the weight of national cares, the familiarity with authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>I met him on the steamer that brought him to <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, and saw him <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the captain's cabin, where he was waiting for me, alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1877"/>He threw his arms around me&mdash;and I kissed him. He was my chief, my <pb id="p.178" n="178"/> General, my friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>From that moment dated a new intimacy, closer than the old. I was with him incessantly during his stay in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>He wrote at once a telegram to the <rs>Government</rs> asking that I might be permitted to accompany him, but I changed the message and put it in my own name, so that he who had been <rs type="role2">President</rs> should not be placed in the position of soliciting favors from his successor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>But with all my intimacy I noticed now a broader man in manner and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/>He was far more conscious; he understood himself better; he knew his powers; he knew what he wanted to do and say under all circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>He was a greater man than the <num value="1">one</num> I had left in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>I was especially struck with his poise in the new situations into which he was thrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>No <num value="1">one</num> had anticipated the great popular enthusiasm that welcomed him everywhere in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; but he was as calm and undisturbed as of old, ready to receive and acknowledge the ovation, for such it was, gratified deeply, but not elated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>His fluency of speech amazed me. He had learned the art since I had met him last.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/>In his association on more than equal terms with the most distinguished Englishmen, at the dinners with dukes and Prime Ministers, at which he was always <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, in the company of Princes and of the <rs>Queen</rs>, he preserved his composure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>The etiquette was of course unfamiliar to him, but he advised himself of it in advance, and then conformed just so far as he thought proper and dignified in his position, but no further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>He was in no way neglectful of ceremonies, far less offensive, but he did not forget that he was a republican, nor that he had been a President.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>He said everywhere that the compliments paid to him were meant for the nation that he represented, which was a very proud sort of humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>But it was no assumption in him to assume that he represented <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>He remained as simple as ever in his bearing, and still almost plain, but he was seldom awkward or <pb id="p.179" n="179"/> embarrassed now. He was able to criticise <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Victoria</foreName></persName>'s manner, and he declared to me that he thought it uneasy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>He said <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> seemed too anxious to put him at his ease, and he implied that the anxiety was unnecessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>With the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>French Republic</rs>, <persName n="Mac,Marshal,,,," id="n0262.0020.00179.01593" reg="mostcommon:Mac,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Mac</surname></persName>-<persName n="Mahon,,,,," id="n0262.0020.00179.01594" reg="mostcommon:Mahon,nomatch:0"><surname>Mahon</surname></persName>, he was on delightful terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>They walked up and down the <rs>Champs Elysees</rs> arm in arm, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0020.00179.01595" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> talking English and <persName n="French,,MacMahon,,," id="n0262.0020.00179.01596" reg="default:French,MacMahon,,,"><foreName>MacMahon</foreName> <surname>French</surname></persName>, for each understood the other's language, though unable to speak it. He received the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit from the <rs>King</rs> of the <name>Belgians</name>, and asked, as any <num value="1">one</num> else might with an equal, when he and <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0020.00179.01597" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> could pay their respects to the <rs>Queen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>I was present at the interview, and thought of <placeName key="tgn,7015683" n="1.000 4" reg="galena, jo daviess, illinois">Galena</placeName> and the neighbors there of this man who was exchanging visits with sovereigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>On this occasion he was exact in his etiquette; he went himself to the door of the room, but directed me to wait upon the <rs>King</rs> to his carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>But <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name> would not permit this attention, and said peremptorily that I must not descend the staircase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2691"/>The quarrel then would have been, not between <num value="2">two</num> different sections of the <rs>Republic</rs>, but between enemies in every city and street and household.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2692"/>It is quite as much by what he left undone in civil affairs, as by what he did, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00256.02420" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is to be judged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2693"/>His singular power of restraint, backed by his acknowledged energy and force, was of enormous advantage to the country at times like those in which he performed the duties of the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2694"/>And although his Presidental career is often harshly criticised by some who admire his military ability, though he was supported, and sometimes seemed to be surrounded, by many whose association conferred neither honor on himself nor benefit on the country: though there were acts in his Administration which he publicly admitted were blunders, history will be far from recording his political career as a failure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2695"/>He took up the cares of state not only immediately after a convulsion that was <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest in history, but after the situation had been complicated to the very verge of revolution by the struggle between <num value="2">two</num> coordinate branches of the <rs>Government</rs>; after the disruption of a party, the impeachment and trial of a President, the revival of much of the bitterness of the war. No task could be more difficult or delicate than his, at such a juncture, and it can at least be said that after <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> of power he handed over to his successor the <rs>Government</rs> of a country so far pacified and reconciled that even the awful shape of a disputed election had been appeased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2696"/>The States were all restored to the <rs>Union</rs>, and Reconstruction, whatever its merits or demerits, was accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2697"/>That measure was not initiated by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00256.02421" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, nor were all its provisions or results those which he would <pb id="p.257" n="257"/> have recommended or desired, but Congress laid down the law and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02422" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> as <rs type="role2">President</rs> executed it. During the <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure> of his civil career, for in reality this began with <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02423" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Andrew,,,:17"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s accession to power, he performed a task fully equal in importance to the country to whatever he achieved in war. A man with less sense and patriotism, or more ambition, might in his position, and with his immense popularity, have undone much that he had accomplished in the war. But <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02424" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s self-abnegation was fully equal to <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>'s at the close of the <name>Revolution</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2698"/>It is true no crown was ever offered him, and the country would certainly have hurled him into insignificance or worse had he attempted to seize <num value="1">one</num>; but there were a <num value="1000">thousand</num> opportunities to increase his prerogative and confirm his power which he steadily refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2699"/>All who knew him closely at the times when temptation might have been strong with other men, will assuredly testify that the thought of selfaggrandize-ment was always furthest from his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2700"/>He had, indeed, an apparent lack of ambition, and even of aspiration, that amounted almost to indifference; a singular moderation running through his whole character, which some considered stolidity; but which tempered what without it would have been harsher qualities, and produced all the results of wisdom, patience, judgment, and even far-sighted patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2701"/>He saw, even plainer than his political friends, the possibilities that told in his own favor and he put them away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2702"/>Shortly after the close of the war I was present when <persName n="Sumner,,Charles,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02425" reg="default:Sumner,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> proposed to him that a painting should be placed at the <rs>Capitol</rs> to represent the surrender of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02426" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Robert,E.,,:3"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>; but <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02427" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> declared that he was unwilling that any commemoration of the defeat and disaster of <num value="1">one</num> section of the country should be perpetuated at the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2703"/>Again, a few days before his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inauguration, <persName n="Blaine,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02428" reg="mostcommon:Blaine,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Blaine</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Speaker">Speaker</rs> of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, formally suggested that Congress should allow <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00257.02429" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> a leave of absence from the army for <num value="4">four</num> <pb id="p.258" n="258"/> years, so that at the expiration of his Presidential term he could resume his place as <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>, with the rank and position created especially for him. But <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00258.02430" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> said he could not sleep at night if he kept <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00258.02431" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00258.02432" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,P.,H.,,:3"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> and all the other officers lower down out of the promotion which his retention of office would prohibit to each of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2704"/>He declared that they had won their promotion as rightfully as he had his own, and he gave up his rank and appointed <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n0262.0029.00258.02433" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> the day after he was inaugurated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2705"/>People have forgotten his popularity after the close of the war, but at that time almost anything that could have been proposed to honor him would have been approved, and it was his very unselfishness, his purity in public matters that afterward made his private misfortunes possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2706"/>But during the last years of his Presidency the reaction that comes so inevitably to the most fortunate of men almost overwhelmed him. Political friends became enemies, private and personal ones used their connection with him to advance themselves and their interests illegitimately; and the public believed far worse things of him and of them than there was cause for. I was away from the country during all this period, but I know how keenly he felt the loss of his popularity, of the change in the public feeling toward himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2707"/>After it was decided that he was not to become a candidate for <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> term, he was extremely anxious to lay down his responsibilities and his duties, wearied of public life and public cares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2708"/>But then came the great trouble of the closing months of his Administration, the disputed election, carrying danger, anxiety, and the possibility of strife into the very last hours of his Presidency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2709"/>Finally this was averted, and he was able to transfer his great office to a successor without difficulty or disturbance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2712"/>She did not accompany her husband to the <rs>Capitol</rs> to see another man installed in the place which he had held; and it may not be improper to say just here, that as perhaps any wife in her situation would have been, <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0029.00259.02437" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was unwilling to have her husband retire; she had desired him to become a candidate for another term, and the dignity with which she relinquished her own honors and place receives to my mind an added illustration when this sentiment is known.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2713"/>She prepared a suitable entertainment for the new occupants of the <rs>Executive Mansion</rs>, on their return from the <rs>Capitol</rs> to take her place from her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3000"/>I asked if he wished to see <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00284.02630" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, but he replied that he would not trouble the <rs>General</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3001"/>Then we waited for an answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3002"/>I suppose such a message had never been sent to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> before since her coronation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3003"/>If the <rs>Queen</rs> had been ill-tempered or lacking in taste or tact there might have been an unpleasant complication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3004"/><pb id="p.285" n="285"/> It was possible that the entire invitation might be withdrawn, or a message might be sent that would make it impossible for <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02631" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to remain, and thus necessitate the return of the whole party to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3005"/>Even international feeling might be aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3006"/>But <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02632" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had been assured that he should be treated as an ex-sovereign, and it seemed to him, with his democratic notions, that he was not treated as a private gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3007"/>Certainly no private gentleman bidden with his son to the <placeName key="tgn,7014664;tgn,2115169;tgn,2115031;tgn,2113715;tgn,2110221" n="0.030 000000.1488	placename;tgn,7014664;Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.030 000000.1488	placename;tgn,2115169;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.030 000000.1488	placename;tgn,2115031;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.030 000000.1488	placename;tgn,2113715;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.030 000000.1488	placename;tgn,2110221;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia,New Kent,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Yorktown, York, Virginia,York,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;White House, Mecklenburg, Virginia,Mecklenburg,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia,Rockingham,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Aarons Creek, Halifax, Virginia,Halifax,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">White House</placeName> would have expected that son to dine at a different table and in a different room from himself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3008"/>As for me, I was acting as <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02633" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s aide-de-camp, and could not complain because I was to dine with the <rs type="role" reg="Aide de camp">aides-de-camp</rs> of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3009"/>Still I felt that I had been invited by a lady and on arriving at her house was requested to sit at a different table from that to which I had been asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3010"/>This might be royal etiquette, but it was not good breeding, and it never happened to me at another court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3011"/>However, I was determined that no question affecting me should complicate the affair or interfere with <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02634" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3012"/>Besides this, I was a public officer, accredited to the <rs>Queen</rs>, and bound perhaps to accept her decisions in the etiquette of her own palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3013"/>So no question whatever was made about me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3014"/>Finally we all dressed for dinner to be ready for whatever might happen, and before I returned to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02635" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s drawing-room the <rs>Master</rs> of the <name>Household</name> came to me. He had delivered the <rs>General</rs>'s message, and <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> commanded him to say that she would be happy to have <persName n="Jesse,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02636" reg="mostcommon:Jesse,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jesse</surname></persName> dine at her table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3015"/>So the difficulty was obviated by the good sense and good breeding of the <rs>Queen</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3016"/>The party that dined with <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> were all assembled before she entered the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3017"/>After speaking with each guest separately the <rs>Queen</rs> took the arm of her son, <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Leopold</foreName></persName>, afterward <rs type="role">Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00285.02637" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was asked to give his arm to <persName><roleName n="Princess">the Princess</roleName> <foreName>Christian</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3019"/>Thus <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02638" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> preceded the <rs>Queen</rs>'s own daughter and her son-in-law; which was a distinct concession to him of rank equal to royalty, and as different as possible from the etiquette observed by the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3020"/><persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02639" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, however, did not receive the same recognition; <num value="2">two</num> duchesses preceded her and she went in with a lord-in-waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3021"/><persName><foreName>Jesse</foreName></persName> was placed nearly at the tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3022"/>The idea seemed to be to give <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02640" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> a place that should indicate extraordinary deference according to royal rules, but not to recognize his democratic family further than courtesy required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3023"/>The <rs>Queen</rs>, however, was gracious to all, and the dinner passed pleasantly enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3024"/>At table <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02641" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was not placed next <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3025"/>She had <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Leopold</foreName></persName> on <num value="1">one</num> side of her and <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Christian</foreName></persName> on the other; then the <num value="2">two</num> Princesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3027"/>His conversation with <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> was therefore not animated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3028"/>I went to dinner with the <name>Household</name> in another room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3029"/>I remember that <persName n="Cowell,Sir,John,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02643" reg="default:Cowell,John,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Cowell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ely,Lady,,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02644" reg="mostcommon:Ely,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Ely</surname></persName>, <persName n="Melville,Lady,Susan,,," id="n0262.0032.00286.02645" reg="default:Melville,Susan,,,"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <foreName>Susan</foreName> <surname>Melville</surname></persName>, and others of the <rs>Queen</rs>'s ladies and gentlemen were present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3030"/>My companions were extremely affable, and I thought they seemed to wish to make up for my disappointment, so far as they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3031"/>Almost immediately after we rose <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName> disappeared, but came back at once and announced that I was to be taken in and presented to the <rs>Queen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3032"/>I had gone through the forms of presentation at levees and drawing-rooms, but had never exchanged a word with <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3033"/>She was standing with her dinner company at <num value="1">one</num> end of a long gallery when I was led up to her. She bowed with extreme graciousness, and said immediately that she had to thank me for a book I had once sent her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3034"/>It had been acknowledged at the tine by a courteous note, but with the royal faculty the circumstance was recalled and the acknowledgment repeated now. Of course I was impressed by the courtesy, and thanked <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> for recollecting my present after so many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3035"/>The <rs>Queen</rs> then went on to ask me how <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00287.02649" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was enjoying his visit to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3036"/>This gave me an opportunity to speak of his reception throughout the country, which I was courtier enough to say <q direct="unspecified">culminates to-night.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3037"/>At this the <name>Majesty</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> positively dropped me a courtesy and was evidently gratified; so that we were equal on <num value="1">one</num> point at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3038"/>I think she felt sorry that she had left me out and wanted to atone; at any rate she made me feel very pleasant for a moment or <num value="2">two</num> in spite of my disappointment.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3040"/>I took the opportunity to speak of this as indicating the satisfaction which a <num value="1000000">million</num> of <persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n0262.0032.00287.02651" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName> felt at the compliment the <rs>Queen</rs> was paying to their representative; and the royal features beamed again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3041"/>There is indeed a charm of expression, a winning smile that comes over <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> countenance, a grace of demeanor when she means to be gracious, which is more than ordinary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3042"/>It was not because she was a queen, for I have been well received by other queens; and at this moment, as may be supposed, I was not altogether in the mood to admire; but the plain little woman conquered me with a sweetness of look and smile which I had heard of before but had never seen at court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3043"/>It is of no imaginable consequence, but I forgave her my dinner.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3044"/>She remained in the room only a few moments longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3045"/>I remember that she talked with <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0032.00287.02652" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, who told me <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> afterward of a good thing she said to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3046"/>Considering the etiquette of the dining-room, it seemed to me a perfectly fair reminder between the <num value="2">two</num> women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3047"/>The <rs>Queen</rs> said something about her own labors or duties, and <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0032.00288.02653" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> replied: <q direct="unspecified">Yes, I can imagine them: I too have been the wife of a great ruler.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3049"/>As for <persName><foreName>Jesse</foreName></persName>, he did not say to his father, as the newspapers declared, <q direct="unspecified">Pa, introduce her,</q> but behaved with propriety and like a young gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3050"/>He had held out for his point of etiquette, as well as the royalties, and had won. He could afford to be polite.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3051"/>After a while, the <rs>Queen</rs> looked around, and <num value="2">two</num> duchesses approached and laid a lace shawl about her shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3052"/><name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name> courtesied, every <num value="1">one</num> else bowed or courtesied very low, <num value="2">two</num> great doors behind her were opened, and the <rs>Queen</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <name>Princesses</name> vanished, backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3053"/>The remainder of the party were now scattered in <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the drawing-rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3054"/>There was music in the distance, according to a printed programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3055"/>Some of the company, <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0032.00288.02655" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Jesse,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> among them, played at cards, others talked, and at <num value="11">eleven</num> the ladies retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3057"/>I accompanied the <rs>General</rs>, and <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Leopold</foreName></persName> came down in a smoking suit of gorgeous purple and yellow satin, and played a game with the conqueror of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3059"/>Next morning the <rs>Queen</rs> sent her album for the autographs of the whole party (<persName><foreName>Jesse</foreName></persName>'s included), and <num value="2">two</num> of her ladies were directed to show us the most famous pictures and the great porcelain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3064"/>The episode of the invitations I account for by supposing that at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> she intended to have me at her table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3065"/>She was good-natured, and when the invitation for <persName><foreName>Jesse</foreName></persName> was asked, acquiesced, but doubtless then said, <q direct="unspecified">Let them both dine with the <name>Household</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3066"/>Then, when the question of the table was raised, she admitted <persName><foreName>Jesse</foreName></persName>; so that, from her own point of view, she was extremely gracious throughout; and from anybody's point (but mine) she was amiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3067"/>I suffered for others, which is, of course, very much to my credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>But I certainly think the <rs>Queen</rs> should have left out some of her own courtiers on an international occasion, rather than a foreign gentleman whom she had thought it became her dignity to invite to her table.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3386"/>Of course there was no possibility of his returning to place at that time, but if the crisis had lasted and there had been a general demand for his services, I think he would not then have hesitated to perform what he might have considered a public duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>The idea of some such possibility was certainly presented to his mind; and although he was always the last man to prepare for unlikely contingencies, he still was revolving what might be incumbent on him in case the gravity of the situation increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3388"/>He admitted to me on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion that it might become his duty to return to public life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3389"/>Of course he had not the slightest thought of taking any such step except in accordance with constitutional provisions, and he certainly had no desire to resume the cares which he had so recently laid aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3390"/>He simply did not mean to shrink from any of the responsibilities which his past career and the appreciation of his countrymen might impose.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3391"/>But the crisis passed away, and he felt a genuine satisfaction <pb id="p.316" n="316"/> at this result; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because of the relief to the country, and next, because the shadow of further public station had faded from his own future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3392"/>After this, he was more averse than ever to the thought of again becoming a Presidential aspirant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3393"/>But his triumphal tour abroad suggested the idea to his friends at home, many of whom were anxious that he should be kept out of the country in order to avoid premature political complications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3394"/>As early as <dateStruct value="1878-03-"><month reg="03">March</month>, <year reg="1878">1878</year></dateStruct>, he wrote to me from <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>: <q direct="unspecified">Most every letter I get from the <name>States</name>, like <persName n="Porter,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00316.02819" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Horace,,,:7"><surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s to you, asks me to remain abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3397"/>This remark was meant for me as much as for any <num value="1">one</num> else, for I had not hesitated to let him know that I thought the country would desire his return to power; but at that time he had said no word to warrant me in supposing that he entertained the idea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3398"/>He did not, it is true, return to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> so soon as he had expected, but this was because of an improvement in his financial circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3399"/>When he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrived in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, he told me that he had only <measure n="25000dollars" type="currency">$25,000</measure> to spend in foreign travel; if that would last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> he could stay abroad <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, but if it became exhausted sooner he would be obliged to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3400"/>He was treated so much like a sovereign that his expenses were proportionally increased, and of course the sum that he mentioned did not hold out nearly as long as he had hoped; but his son <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName></persName>, then living in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, was able to make certain investments for his father which resulted in placing nearly <measure n="60000dollars" type="currency">$60,000</measure> at his disposal, and then <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0036.00316.02820" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Heidelberg,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was enabled to travel as far and as long as he pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3401"/>Accordingly, he extended his stay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3402"/>I wrote to him in the latter part of <dateStruct value="1878--"><year reg="1878">1878</year></dateStruct>, repeating something that had been said to me about the possible effect of my history of his campaigns upon his political prospects, and <pb id="p.317" n="317"/> suggesting that the concluding volumes should be delayed until his return to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>; but he replied: <q direct="unspecified">I do not see what the publication of the book at any particular time can have to do with the formation of public opinion as to political objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3408"/>I believe that at this time he had neither expectation nor ambition to return to power.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3409"/>He showed this very plainly by insisting, against the advice of nearly every political friend he had in the world, on returning to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3410"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> who knew anything about American politics could foresee an immense enthusiasm on his arrival, which, if it was developed opportunely, might sweep him into the <name>Presidency</name>, while, if time were allowed for it to cool, all the opposition and efforts of rival candidates could, of course, be concentrated, and render even his renomination difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3411"/>This was said or written to him in a <num value="100">hundred</num> forms by the men who wished his renomination and thought themselves sufficiently intimate or important to offer their views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3412"/>But he paid no attention to the advice, and returned to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in the autumn of <dateStruct value="1879--"><year reg="1879">1879</year></dateStruct>, nearly a year before the <name>Presidential</name> election, and more than <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> sooner than his supporters desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3413"/>The reason he always assigned for this was that <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0036.00317.02822" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Heidelberg,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> wanted to see her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3414"/>He himself was far from being tired of travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3419"/></p> 
<p>The enthusiasm that attended his welcome was greater than the most sanguine had anticipated, and gave him the keenest gratification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3420"/>In <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> he wrote me a long account of it from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3432"/>Time was given for the opposition to crystallize; his rivals recovered from their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock of astonishment at his popularity; the dislike entertained in many quarters for <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> term was worked up vigorously, and the political world was in the <pb id="p.319" n="319"/> midst of a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3433"/>Whether the instinct of fight was aroused in him, whether he felt after prolonged rest a willingness for new labors, or whether after so wide and varied an experience, abroad as well as at home, he was conscious of a greater fitness than ever for high place&mdash;it is hard to say. All these considerations may have influenced him; the advice and persuasion of most of those who had been closest either as political or personal friends may have told; the pressure of his own family, naturally eager to regain the position they had once enjoyed, was incessant; and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00319.02824" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Heidelberg,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> allowed every step to be taken to present his name to the country and the convention without <num value="1">one</num> sign of disapproval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3434"/>Delegates were chosen pledged to vote for him; important statesmen known to have always been in his confidence openly advocated his nomination; yet with that singular reticence which he sometimes displayed, he made neither public nor private utterance on the subject, and men like <persName n="Conkling,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00319.02825" reg="mostcommon:Conkling,nomatch:0"><surname>Conkling</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cameron,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00319.02826" reg="mostcommon:Cameron,nomatch:0"><surname>Cameron</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00319.02827" reg="mostcommon:Logan,John,A.,,:1"><surname>Logan</surname></persName> declared in intimate conferences that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00319.02828" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Heidelberg,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had never said to either that he would be a candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3435"/>He always had a superstitious feeling, which he describes in his memoirs, that he would fail in any effort made by himself to secure his own advancement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3436"/>He had done nothing whatever to promote his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> nomination, and nothing directly for his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>; and he determined now to follow the same course in regard to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3443"/>Of course this freedom was only with his especial intimates, his family, and a very few other tried friends whom he chanced to meet at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3446"/>All who met him were impressed with his views in regard to those Asiatic countries, the relations with them which he thought might be developed, the trade we might create, the immense advantage both they and we might receive from an intimate understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3447"/>His opinions were very broad, and he talked with a knowledge of the subject that made him fluent, and an interest which at times almost inspired him to eloquence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3448"/>Once or twice he addressed a party of <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> men of importance in business or affairs, and enchained their attention for hours while he laid before them his information and his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3452"/>He had seen other countries, both the peoples and the rulers; the emperors and tycoons and sultans, and the ministers and parliaments and the nations themselves; his views were widened, and his whole character changed; but at the same time his national feeling and his democratic preferences were intensified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3454"/>I am sure, from what he said, that he was conscious of most of his former errors in political administration, and intended to rectify them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3466"/>Young, however, doubtless appeared as the spokesman of others whose opinions backed his own, though his fidelity and friendship gave weight to what he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3467"/>But the letter was sent, in opposition to the views of <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0036.00322.02847" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Heidelberg,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and without her knowledge, and was calculated, of course, to dampen the enthusiasm and bewilder the counsels of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0036.00322.02848" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Heidelberg,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s most devoted adherents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3469"/>But it was too late to recede; his friends had committed both him and themselves, and they were not influenced by this phase of irresolution which had passed over him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3472"/>Even former <pb id="p.323" n="323"/> followers who did not support him in the concluding political effort of his life never held the same place in his personal regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4321"/>I do not think, however, this was always gratitude in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0047.00402.03842" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Sam,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, so much as a pride in not doing the ordinary ignoble thing of turning away in the hour of success from those whose friendship he had once been glad to claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4322"/>This he could not stoop to. The burden of the obligation seemed heavier in these instances than for far greater services rendered afterward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4323"/>Later in his career he felt, I think, that the distinction of association with him and the benefits he was able to confer, compensated for any service his friends performed for him. He was glad to aid or advance his friends, as the world knows, but he was fully conscious of all the advantages or honors he bestowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4324"/>He never spoke of these; <pb id="p.403" n="403"/> but in his inmost soul he felt the full weight of every obligation he imposed, and after his greatness became conspicuous I am not sure that he thought what was done for him was any more than he deserved, whether from the country or from individual friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4325"/>Of course, he made no display of such a sentiment, and there are many who will not consider it a fault or even a failing in a man like him to be conscious of the importance of his own services, whether to the <rs>State</rs> or to his friends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4334"/>But very few of his important or personal associates liked cards as he did; so that most of his comrades at the whist or poker table were men to whom his political or military or personal secrets were unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4335"/>The fellowship in <num value="1">one</num> direction was dropped entirely in another.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4336"/>I think that after the death of <persName n="Rawlins,,,,," id="n0262.0047.00404.03861" reg="mostcommon:Rawlins,nomatch:0"><surname>Rawlins</surname></persName> I knew <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0047.00404.03862" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Sam,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> as closely as any <num value="1">one</num> except <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0047.00404.03863" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Sam,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>; but there were whole phases of his life if not sides of his character that were rarely revealed to me; some, it may be, I never learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4337"/>He never discussed his business relations with me, though I saw much of him in the years in which he was a business man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4342"/>So, too, there were many details of his family affairs of which I was unapprised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4343"/>It is true I avoided the knowledge; after his sons became grown men I did not desire to intrude upon either their or his affairs, and even while I lived at his house and was working with him on his <q direct="unspecified">Memoirs</q> I sought to keep aloof from the minutiae of his business and of that of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4344"/>All mention of the <rs>Vanderbilt</rs> correspondence was thus at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> withheld from me; but finally the <rs>General</rs> himself <pb id="p.405" n="405"/> took me into his confidence on this subject, though the family very naturally had not desired to do so.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4346"/>He never, I believe, gave all his confidence on every subject to any human being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4347"/>Of course, however, his wife and family and his closest friends saw more in him than he supposed they observed; and perhaps discovered points in his character which were less apparent to himself than to those whose eyes were sharpened by affection and lifelong intercourse.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>His political career was blighted by those whom he sustained in evil report and good report; his Presidency was less brilliant than it might have been because of the mistakes and misdeeds of others; though there were some, doubtless, who suffered unjustly because ignominy cast on them reflected odium on <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0047.00406.03881" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Sam,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4460"/>But all this passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4461"/>The children of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0048.00414.03936" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> had their day. Then came sorrow and humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4462"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the beloved chief went into business and was wronged; that he and his lost their all; that the sense of his disgrace rather than the loss of fortune, struck to the soul the man who had been honored by the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4463"/>The long and terrible story has been told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4464"/>The nation is familiar with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4465"/>Then I&mdash;and I believe even they&mdash;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fully discovered how dear they were to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4466"/>But the passion for his children was now developed into something exceptional and almost unreasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4467"/>He admired the talent of his sons as if it had been extraordinary; he declared <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName></persName> had a marvelous business capacity; that <persName n="Grant,Colonel,,,," id="n0262.0048.00414.03938" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was fit to command armies; that <persName n="Jesse,,,,," id="n0262.0048.00414.03939" reg="mostcommon:Jesse,nomatch:0"><surname>Jesse</surname></persName> was a mathematical genius.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4468"/>All the world knows <pb id="p.415" n="415"/> how he labored for them after he had been given up for dead; how he revived to struggle on their account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4469"/>His passion was pathetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4470"/>It reached out almost from the grave toward those children for whom he was suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4471"/>He never believed for a moment aught against their good name any more than against his own. He lived for them; he died for them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4472"/>All this was revealed in those last months of his existence, and I have no doubt the feeling was heightened by his illness; the protracted parting not only aggravated his sufferings but intensified his affection, until <num value="1">one</num> was as harrowing as the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4473"/>He not only did not know until the last how profound his feeling was, but while he lingered, the feeling grew from day to day, as the cancer did, downward and inward into his nature, till at last it consumed him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4485"/>The injury <pb id="p.417" n="417"/> was thought to be the rupture of a muscle in the upper part of the thigh, and although after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few days the suffering was less, any quick or sudden movement of the limb was so painful that the <rs>General</rs> was unable to move in his bed without assistance; he did not leave it for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4486"/>A few days after the fall he suffered an attack of pleurisy, which also at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> occasioned excruciating pain, but was not absolutely dangerous.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4494"/>I had been absent from the country during the winter, but returned late in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, and at once saw much of my old chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4495"/>I found him cheerful and uncomplaining, going to his office daily on business, interested in politics and affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4498"/>He, however, responded to no such intimations, and never said even to his family that he desired or expected a return to public station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4499"/>Any expression that ever fell from him on the subject was to repress or repel the suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4500"/>He was resting from national cares, and in the unwonted enjoyment of a private competence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>His pains finally became so frequent and so acute that <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00426.04019" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> persuaded him to see <persName n="Barker,Doctor,Fordyce,,," id="n0262.0049.00426.04020" reg="default:Barker,Fordyce,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Fordyce</foreName> <surname>Barker</surname></persName>, who instantly said if the case were his own or that of <num value="1">one</num> of his family, he should consult <persName n="Douglas,Doctor,J.,H.,," id="n0262.0049.00426.04021" reg="default:Douglas,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>; and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00426.04022" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> went the same day to <persName n="Douglas,Doctor,,,," id="n0262.0049.00426.04023" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>This was on the <dateStruct value="-10-22"><day reg="22">22d</day> of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>When he returned he said the physician had told him that his throat was affected by a complaint with a cancerous tendency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>He seemed serious but not alarmed, though it was afterward learned that he had pressed <persName n="Douglas,Doctor,,,," id="n0262.0049.00426.04024" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> for close <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> information, and had detected a greater apprehension on the part of the physician than the family at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>Still there was disquietude and even alarm,&mdash;the terrible word cancer was itself almost a knell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4633"/>It was now <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, and all through this month he went regularly to the physician's house, about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from his own, taking the street-car.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4634"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he went alone, but after a while he was persuaded to take a man-servant with him. <num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of the family called on <persName n="Douglas,Doctor,,,," id="n0262.0049.00427.04025" reg="nearbymention:Douglas,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> to make further inquiry, and the response awakened further solicitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4635"/>The pains did not decrease, and the extraction of <num value="4">four</num> teeth greatly aggravated his nervous condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4636"/>He went to a dentist to have <num value="1">one</num> tooth taken out, but his fortitude was such that the operator was doubtless deceived, and proposed the extraction of <num value="3">three</num> others, and the shock to the <rs>General</rs>'s system was <num value="1">one</num> from which he did not recover for weeks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4637"/>As the weather became colder the disease was further aggravated by the exposure to which he was subjected in the street-car; yet for a long time he refused to go by the carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4638"/><persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00427.04026" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and his children tried in vain to persuade him. <num value="1">One</num> morning he announced his intention of going again in the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4639"/>It was at breakfast, and I implored him not to do so. I declared he was taking his life in his hands and that he had no right to risk what was so precious to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4640"/>But he was obstinate, and I got up from the table very much agitated, and said I had rather he would stick a knife into me than have him go in the street-car.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4641"/>He was silent, but after a little he ordered the carriage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4642"/>In <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> his pains became still more excruciating; he could not swallow without torture, and his sufferings at table were intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4643"/>He was obliged to use liquid food and to avoid acids altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4644"/>I shall always recall his figure as he sat at the head of the table, his head bowed over his plate, his mouth set grimly, his features clinched in the endeavor to conceal <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> the expression of pain, especially from <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00428.04027" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, who sat at the other end. He no longer carved or helped the family, and at last was often obliged to leave before the meal was over, pacing the hall or the adjoining library in his agony.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4645"/>At this time he said to me that he had no desire to live if he was not to recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4646"/>He preferred death at once to lingering, hopeless disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4647"/>He made the same remark to several of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4648"/>For a while he seemed to lose, not courage, yet a little of his hope, almost of his grip on life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4649"/>He did not care to write, nor even to talk; he made little physical effort, and often sat for hours propped up in his chair, with his hands clasped, looking at the blank wall before him, silent, contemplating the future; not alarmed, but solemn, at the prospect of pain and disease, and only death at the end. It was like a man gazing into his open grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4650"/>He was in no way dismayed, but the sight was to me the most appalling I have ever witnessed:&mdash;the conqueror looking at his inevitable conqueror; the stern soldier to whom so many armies had surrendered, watching the approach of that enemy before whom even he must yield.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4651"/>But his apathy was not long-lived; the indifference to his work was soon over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4652"/>I had been used for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> to speak to him with the greatest freedom, although only at rare intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4653"/>He was not a man whom any <num value="1">one</num> could approach unless he permitted, but there came moments and crises when he allowed me to say things to him such as few men ever say to each other; and I ventured now to beg him to throw aside this strange depression&mdash;the result of his illness; to be himself; not to give way, even to fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4654"/>I urged him to try to recover; not to let the world say that he was crushed by misfortune, or put an end to by <persName n="Ward,,Ferdinand,,," id="n0262.0049.00428.04028" reg="default:Ward,Ferdinand,,,"><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>; to think of the immense achievement his book would be if he could himself tell the story of his own motives and purposes and plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4655"/>I pleaded with him to live and work, not only for his fame, but for his family, whose fortune his <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> book would secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4656"/>He did not say much, from which I knew that my words would be considered; I was sure that he appreciated their motive and did not resent their freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4657"/>The only utterance I can recall in reply was, <q direct="unspecified">I am not going to commit suicide.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4658"/>But I changed the subject and he spoke cheerfully and very kindly to me on other themes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4659"/>We were driving together from the doctor's house when this conversation occurred, and on our return he went to work with renewed vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4660"/>I told <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00429.04029" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> what I meant to do in advance, and reported the result afterward, and she approved it all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4661"/>He enjoyed his labors now, and quite got the literary fever for a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4662"/>He liked to have his pages read aloud to the family in the evening, so that he might hear how they, sounded and receive their comments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4663"/>He worked, however, for the most part from <num value="10">ten</num> or <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> in the morning until <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> in the afternoon, and sometimes again later in the day. Once in a while <persName n="Tower,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00429.04030" reg="mostcommon:Tower,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Tower</surname></persName>, a comrade in the <rs>Mexican War</rs>, came in and discussed the chapters describing the capture of <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName> or the march on <placeName key="tgn,1001893" n="1.000 7" reg="mexico">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4664"/>Sometimes <persName n="Chaffee,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00429.04031" reg="nearbymention:Chaffee,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chaffee</surname></persName> listened to the political passages, and begged the <rs>General</rs> not to emasculate them, but to say all he thought without fear or favor.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4665"/>Daily about <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> he was interrupted by his grandchildren, who stopped as they passed to their lunch, and looked in at the open door, not entering till he saw them and summoned them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4666"/>Their prattle and kisses were always welcome, and made me think that the very misfortune which brought them to his house had its compensations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4667"/>He took a peculiar pleasure in their society, and when at <num value="1">one</num> time it was thought that they disturbed his labors, and they were told not to visit him, he was distressed at the omission and revoked the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4668"/>They came, indeed, like a burst of light into the sick man's study, <num value="3">three</num> of them, dancing, gamboling, laughing&mdash;as pretty a brood of merry, graceful grandchildren <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> as ever a conqueror claimed for descendants, or looked upon to perpetuate his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4669"/>Those were happy months, at times, despite the anxiety, until the anxiety became despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4670"/>For although the doctors had warned the family, there was yet hope of arresting, if not of curing, the disease, and a possibility of arresting it for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4671"/>His constitution was good; he came of a long-lived stock; and his nerve and will were what all the world knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4672"/>So there was hope; not with so much foundation as could have been desired, but still there was hope.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4673"/>I shall never forget the frolic with the little ones on <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas Day</occasion></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4674"/>They all came to dinner, and the <num value="2">two</num> youngest sat <num value="1">one</num> on each side of him. He was comparatively free from pain at that time; indeed, for a month or more the excruciating tortures came only at intervals; and on this day he took his own place at the head of the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4675"/>The babies were allowed to talk as much as they pleased, and they pleased a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4676"/>They monopolized the conversation, and when their mammas endeavored to check them, the <rs>General</rs> interposed and declared that this was their day. So they prattled across their grandpapa, and made preposterous attempts at jokes in their broken <persName n="English,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00430.04032" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, at which everybody laughed, and no <num value="1">one</num> more heartily than the great warrior, their progenitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4677"/>It was a delicious morsel of sweet in the midst of so much bitter care, a gleam of satisfaction in the gloom of that sad winter, with its fears, and certainties, and sorrows.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4678"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, indeed, can understand the character of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00430.04033" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> who does not know the strength of his regard for his children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4679"/>It was like the passion of a wild beast for its cubs, or the love of a mother for a sucking child,&mdash;instinctive, unreasoning, overweening; yet, what everyone can comprehend and appreciate; natural, and in this grim veteran touching in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4680"/>He not only thought his sons able, wise, and pure; he had a trust in them that was absolute <pb id="p.431" n="431"/> and childlike; his affection even clouded his judgment and turned appreciation into admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4681"/>For them he would have sacrificed fortune, or ease, or even <hi rend="italics">his</hi> fame; for them he did endure criticism and censure, and underwent physical fatigue and pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4682"/>He rose from his death-bed to work for them, and when he thought he was dying his utterances were about his <q direct="unspecified">boys.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4683"/>This feeling, lavished on his own children, reached over to theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4684"/>No parent ever enveloped his entire progeny in a more comprehensive or closer regard; none ever felt them more absolutely a part of himself, his own offspring, the issue of his reins.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4685"/>By the last of the year the editors of <hi rend="italics">The Century</hi> had received <num value="3">three</num> of his articles for their magazine and announced them for publication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4686"/>A large increase in their sales had followed, and the editors, thinking at least a part of this due to his name, sent him in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> a cheque for <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> more than they had stipulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4687"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00431.04034" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intended to divide this sum as a Christmas present between his <num value="2">two</num> daughters-in-law living in the house with him. The amount would have been very acceptable to those ladies, but almost immediately he remembered the debt to <persName n="Wood,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00431.04035" reg="nearbymention:Wood,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>, his benefactor of the <dateStruct value="-05-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and inclosed his cheque for a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> to that friend whom he never saw, stating that the money was the result of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> earnings in literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4688"/>Still later <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00431.04036" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> received from <hi rend="italics">The Century</hi> another <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> in addition to the sum stipulated for the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4689"/>This cheque was the last he ever endorsed, and the payment, beyond his expectations, gave him in the last week of his life the satisfaction of knowing that his literary efforts had a high market value.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4690"/>About <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas</occasion></dateStruct> the pecuniary troubles became more complicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4691"/>There was a possibility of some small creditors of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00431.04037" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Ward,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00431.04038" reg="nearbymention:Ward,Ferdinand,,,"><surname>Ward</surname></persName> attempting to levy on the famous swords and presents he had received from Congress and the <name>States</name> <pb id="p.432" n="432"/> and foreign potentates and cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4692"/>In order to save them <persName n="Vanderbilt,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04039" reg="mostcommon:Vanderbilt,William,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vanderbilt</surname></persName> proposed to enforce his prior claim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4693"/>Talk of this got abroad and was misunderstood.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4694"/>At this juncture <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04040" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> was in New York, and of course visited his old chief and comrade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4695"/>I went to call on him the next day, and he asked me about the possibility of any annoyance to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04041" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> on this score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4696"/>He was extremely anxious, and declared: <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04042" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> must not be allowed to suffer this new disgrace.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4697"/>He would share his own income rather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4698"/>I did not feel at liberty to tell what I knew, even to him, and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04043" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s talk in New York, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> excited a great and general sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4699"/>The result was that a number of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04044" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s friends, with <persName n="Field,,Cyrus,W.,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04045" reg="default:Field,Cyrus,W.,,"><foreName>Cyrus</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Field</surname></persName> at their head, began to raise a fund to save the hero from this last indignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4700"/>A <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">hundred thousand dollars</measure> were to be subscribed to pay off the debt to <persName n="Vanderbilt,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00432.04046" reg="mostcommon:Vanderbilt,William,H.,,:1"><surname>Vanderbilt</surname></persName>, who it was supposed would compromise his claim for that amount.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4791"/>I told the <rs>General</rs> of the visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4792"/>He was gratified at the interest of his friends, but would give me no advice, and I sallied out and spent the day in his service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4796"/>Though he had made no demonstration of anxiety in advance, those who saw most of him and had learned to interpret the few and faint indications he ever gave of his personal preferences and desires, knew how eagerly he had hoped, how cruelly he was disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4797"/>He had indeed looked to this bill as in some sort a reparation of the injury his reputation had sustained; <pb id="p.441" n="441"/> as an official vindication, an intimation that the country still believed in him and regarded his fame, had not forgotten his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4798"/>When the reparation was withheld he suffered proportionally.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4799"/>But he refused to reveal his emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4800"/>A day or <num value="2">two</num> before the decision he declared that he did not expect the passage of the bill; and when the defeat was announced he made no remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4801"/>That evening he played cards with his family and displayed unusual spirit and gayety; but all saw through the mask.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4802"/>All joined, however, in the deception that deceived no <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4803"/>None spoke of the disappointment; and a grim interest in whist apparently absorbed the party that was heart-broken for him who permitted neither wife nor child to come beneath the cloak that concealed his wound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4804"/>All he said was that the bill had failed on the <dateStruct value="-02-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, the anniversary of the fall of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4805"/>The next day he was worse, and in a week the gravest fears seemed near realization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4806"/>He himself appeared conscious of the approach of the end. He had all winter been considering and discussing the choice of a publisher for his book, but had made no decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4807"/>Now he came to a conclusion, and in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> week in <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> the agreement was signed with his publishers, <orgName><persName n="Webster,Mister,C.,L.,," id="n0262.0049.00441.04111" reg="default:Webster,C.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> &amp; Co.</orgName></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4808"/>At the same time the family thought they could no longer withhold from his daughter, <persName n="Sartoris,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00441.04112" reg="mostcommon:Sartoris,Nellie,Grant,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Sartoris</surname></persName>, the knowledge of her father's condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4809"/>She was in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and they had of course notified her of his illness, but, in the hope of amelioration or respite, had deferred the announcement of its critical character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4810"/>But at last they wrote and urged her to hasten to him. After his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> relapse they telegraphed, and she started for his bedside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4811"/>They were still unwilling to inform <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00441.04113" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> that she had been summoned, lest he should be depressed by the certainty that they believed the end to be near; they only told him she had written to say that she was coming; but the amiable concealment hardly deceived <pb id="p.442" n="442"/> him. Though his spirit was broken, his exhaustion extreme, his mind depressed, and certainly at this time weakened, he knew too well why she was coming; but he asked nothing and said nothing.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4812"/>The decay of his energy was to me more distressing than any other symptom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4813"/>For the inroads extended beyond physical strength; they reached at last mental power, and even that nerve and force which made the great character the world has recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4814"/>To <num value="1">one</num> who had studied him for half a lifetime, it was acute pain to watch his strength give way, the light of his intellect flicker and fade, the great qualities all apparently crumble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4815"/>To see <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00442.04114" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> listless, incapable of effort, indifferent to work, absorbed in physical needs and pains,&mdash;a sick man in soul as well as in body,&mdash;was hardest of all.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4816"/>The interest of the country still followed him, and, as the disease proceeded, became still more intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4817"/>The physicians now sent out daily bulletins, and crowds of people watched the boards where these were published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4818"/>His friends determined that still another effort should be made in Congress to pass some bill for his retirement; but he felt little interest in the measure now,&mdash;the languor had reached his heart.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4819"/>For many weeks he had been unable to go down stairs to his meals or to receive a friend, and had spent his days in the room which, before his illness became so acute, he had used as a study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4820"/>Here his papers still remained, and once in a great while he even yet attempted to write a page; but alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4821"/>it was not like what he had once been able to write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4822"/>Sometimes I tried to catch an idea and took it down from his lips, reading it afterward to him to verify it. But these opportunities became rarer and rarer; he had no longer strength for the effort, no longer interest in his work, and at last abandoned all idea of being able to finish it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4823"/>Then his sleeping-room was changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4824"/><persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00442.04115" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> gave up hers at the front of the house to him, and took that which <pb id="p.443" n="443"/> he had occupied at the rear, so that his bed-chamber might be next to his sitting-room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4825"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he objected to the change, but soon his strength was so far gone that he recognized the need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4826"/>The <num value="2">two</num> great chairs in which for months he had sat, leaning back in <num value="1">one</num> with his feet in the other, were taken into that room in which all now thought he would die. Still, he walked almost daily into the apartment where he had spent so many hours during the winter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4827"/>Meanwhile the efforts to pass the bill for his retirement continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4828"/>This <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Arthur,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04116" reg="mostcommon:Arthur,Chester,A.,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Arthur</surname></persName> would sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4829"/>It had passed the <name>Senate</name>, and <persName n="Randall,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04117" reg="mostcommon:Randall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randall</surname></persName>, <persName n="Slocum,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04118" reg="mostcommon:Slocum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Slocum</surname></persName>, and other prominent Democrats wrote to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04119" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s family and friends that the final result would be favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4830"/><persName n="Randall,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04120" reg="mostcommon:Randall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Randall</surname></persName> had greater power in the matter than any <num value="1">one</num> else, his party being in the majority, and no <num value="1">one</num> was more earnest than he. But <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04121" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> remained indifferent, and this time his indifference was real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4831"/>He was absorbed in his sufferings, and believed the bill would be of no use to him now. His family, too, cared little for success, save as it might soothe or possibly brighten his last hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4832"/>The doctors thought it might possibly revive his spirits and prolong his days; but why, some thought, prolong his sufferings?</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4833"/>Finally, on the morning of the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, almost in the last moments of the expiring Congress, the bill was taken up by unanimous consent in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, and passed at once amid great cheering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4834"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, as usual at the close of the session, was in a chamber at the <rs>Capitol</rs>, waiting to sign such bills as had been left to the last moment, and must fail unless they instantly receive his signature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4835"/>He signed the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4836"/>A nomination had been made out in advance and was sent at once to the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4837"/>There lacked but a few moments of the hour when Congress would cease to exist; but <persName n="Edmunds,Senator,,,," id="n0262.0049.00443.04122" reg="mostcommon:Edmunds,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Edmunds</surname></persName>, the presiding officer, announced a message from the <rs>President</rs>; all other business was suspended, and the nomination was confirmed amid tumultuous applause from the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4838"/><pb id="p.444" n="444"/></p> 
<p><persName n="Cleveland,President,,,," id="n0262.0049.00444.04123" reg="mostcommon:Cleveland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Cleveland</surname></persName> signed the commission; it was the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> act of his administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4839"/>The news was telegraphed to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00444.04124" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> by numerous friends, and the same day the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs> of the army notified him officially of his appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4840"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00444.04125" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> wrote the telegram of acceptance in his own hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4841"/>He was again in the army which he had so often led to victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4842"/>It seemed indeed preposterous that any difficulty should have been made about admitting him to that army of which he had been the most illustrious member.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4843"/>But the recognition came too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4844"/>He was gratified and cheered, but the hand of fate had fallen, and could not be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4845"/>There was no revival of his strength, no reaction from his depression, no cessation of his pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4846"/>The exhaustion went on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4847"/>Nevertheless his restoration to the army, though it could neither bring back his health nor prolong his days, made a deeper impression on him than he was willing to betray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4848"/>When the end of the month came this was apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4849"/>All officers of the army are required to make a monthly report of their <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> address to the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">adjutant-general</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4850"/>I do not remember that this report was ever made by him as <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs>, at least after his headquarters were removed from the field; but now he was extremely anxious to make it, and filled out the form himself, though with extreme difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4851"/>It was a question at the time whether he would live through the day, and it was strange to read the language required by the regulations: <q direct="unspecified">My <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> address for the ensuing month will be</q>&mdash;<address><street n="East 66 Sixty-sixth 3">3 East Sixty-sixth street</street></address>, New York.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4852"/>He was still more eager to draw his pay. It seemed as if he looked upon these <num value="2">two</num> circumstances as the seal of his return to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4853"/>No young lieutenant expecting his stipend for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time could have been more anxious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4854"/>He sent for his pay-accounts before the time, and when signed they were forwarded to the paymaster, so that on the day <pb id="p.445" n="445"/> when <dateStruct value="-1-"><month reg="1">the first month</month></dateStruct>'s pay was due the cheque was handed him. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he insisted that <num value="1">one</num> of his sons should go at once to the bank to have the cheque cashed; he wanted to handle the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4855"/>But at this juncture his sons were unwilling to leave the house even for an hour, and he finally consented that <persName n="Chaffee,Mister,,,," id="n0262.0049.00445.04126" reg="mostcommon:Chaffee,J.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chaffee</surname></persName> should draw the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4856"/>When it was handed him he divided it among <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00445.04127" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and his children, saying it was all he had to leave them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4857"/>This was on the <dateStruct value="-03-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, when he was expecting to die within <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4858"/>During the month of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> his daughter arrived, and although, of course, her coming was a solace, yet he knew too well by this time that she had come to see him die. The gathering of other friends also had significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4859"/>He ceased now to leave his room except at rarest intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4860"/><num value="1">One</num> physician always slept in the house.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4861"/>His suffering at last became so poignant that anodynes, the use of which had long been postponed, were indispensable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4862"/>The pain was not of that violent character which had been so sorely dreaded, and which the progress of the disease did not even yet induce; it was rather an intolerable nervousness, as unlike as possible the ordinary phlegmatic calm of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00445.04128" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>,&mdash;a physical excitement and an excessive sleeplessness, combined with a weakness that was spasmodic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4863"/>These sensations were the cause of a consuming wretchedness, but they were not cancerous pains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>The physicians constantly declared that although the cancer was making irresistible advance, it was not the cancer that produced the exhaustion and the nervousness, which, unless arrested, would bring about death very soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>It was only too plain that the mental, moral disease was killing <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00445.04129" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>,&mdash;it was the blow which had struck him to the dust and humiliated him before the world, from which he could not recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>He who was thought so stolid, so strong, so undemonstrative, was dying for a sentiment&mdash;because of the injury to his fame, the aspersions on his honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/><pb id="p.446" n="446"/></p> 
<p>This, now, every <num value="1">one</num> recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> now admitted his purity, and contended for his honor which it was said was the country's. If the universal affection and regard which were showered on him could have salved his wounds he might have been cured, but the recognition and reparation were in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>He who had passed unscathed through <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> and the <rs>Wilderness</rs> was stricken by a weapon more fatal than the rebels ever wielded; he who had recovered from the attacks of political assailants and resisted the calumnies of partisan campaigns was succumbing under the result of the machinations of <num value="1">one</num> man.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>Still, the sympathy soothed his mortal anguish and cast a gleam of consolation into his dying chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>It seemed to change and soften his spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>His indignation at former enemies was mollified by their protestations of pity; the bitterness he had once felt for them was converted into gratitude for their compassionate utterings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>The very fire of his nature seemed quenched by the cold shadows of impending dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>Now, also, an unfamiliar tenderness appeared, which had been long concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>The depths of his affection were disclosed; he was willing to express more of his intimate feeling than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>It was a new man, a new <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00446.04130" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in these matters that was revealed, as if the husks were torn aside and the sweet kernel given to those from whom it had been so long withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>All who approached him intimately at this time recognized this uncloaking of certain parts of his nature which hitherto had been so carefully veiled.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>But <num value="1">one</num> more struggle, <num value="1">one</num> more fierce battle remained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>He had yet to justify himself, to say in person what he had never yet said to the world, of his relations with <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00446.04131" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Ward,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00446.04132" reg="mostcommon:Ward,Ferdinand,,,:6"><surname>Ward</surname></persName>,</q> to tell himself the story of the deceit which had brought him low. <persName n="Fish,,James,D.,," id="n0262.0049.00446.04133" reg="default:Fish,James,D.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Fish</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the partners in the firm, was on trial, and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00446.04134" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s testimony was desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/>He was now so feeble that it was almost dangerous to <pb id="p.447" n="447"/> subject him to the ordeal of an examination; but yet to vindicate his fame, to allow him in his dying moments to utter his own defense, it was worth while incurring whatever danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4881"/>His sons, especially, were anxious that he should say what no <num value="1">one</num> else could ever say for him, and for them; and although in his weak condition he did not appear to share their anxiety, he consented for their sake to make the effort.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>The examination was held in his bedchamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>The lawyers and the stenographer and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> others were present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>The ceremony of an oath was waived, with the consent of the opposing counsel, and the dying man answered all questions and told how he had been betrayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>As the inquiry went on the old spirit of battle revived; he felt all the importance of the occasion, roused himself for the effort, and made a definite declaration, damning in its evidence of the guilt of <num value="1">one</num> man's action, absolute in the assertion of the purity of his own.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>In his testimony he spared neither <persName n="Fish,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00447.04135" reg="nearbymention:Fish,James,D.,,"><surname>Fish</surname></persName> nor <persName n="Ward,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00447.04136" reg="mostcommon:Ward,Ferdinand,,,:6"><surname>Ward</surname></persName>; he felt that this was his last blow, and he dealt it hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>If he had died then, as it was almost feared he might, it would have been, not only like the old warrior of story, standing, but fighting to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>He never relented in his bitterness to these <num value="2">two</num> men. The harshest words I ever heard him speak were his frequent utterances, after he knew that he was doomed, in regard to them who had been the cause of his ruin, and, as he doubtless felt, of his end. These he never said that he forgave.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>The examination lasted nearly an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>When it was over he did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appear more than usually exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>Not after his great disappointment in <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> did his strength or spirit at once give way; so now for a day or <num value="2">two</num> he seemed no weaker than before.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>He recognized himself the decrease of vital force, and believed it was the <pb id="p.448" n="448"/> beginning of the end. The physicians shared the belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/>His prayers had <num value="1">one</num> quality in which they differed from any I ever heard in a dying chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>He prayed for recovery, for strength, for the power of the <name>Almighty</name> to be manifested, for the <name>Hand</name> to be stretched out to save; he prayed as the suffering in Scripture prayed to <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00448.04141" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, for instant, present, physical relief; for rescue, not for submission or resignation; not for the alternatives of the other world, but that there and then, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would save and deliver <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00448.04142" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>This was prayer to which every <num value="1">one</num> of whatever faith could say <q direct="unspecified">Amen.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>They were a medicine to his drooping spirit, an anodyne to the excited, trembling heart, a stimulant at the moment when the pulse was failing and the breath fluttering.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>But I still spent my days at the house, and often remained for the night, lying where I could, or snatching sleep in a chair, with <persName n="Newman,Doctor,,,," id="n0262.0049.00449.04145" reg="mostcommon:Newman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Newman</surname></persName> or <persName n="Chaffee,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00449.04146" reg="mostcommon:Chaffee,J.,B.,,:1"><surname>Chaffee</surname></persName> or other intimate friends.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>The family were all summoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>After this he went lower and nearer death than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>The pulse was flickering like a candle, and the physicians said: <q direct="unspecified">He is going.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>But there had been an injection of brandy prepared some days before, for just such emergencies, and <num value="1">one</num> physician whispered to the other: <q direct="unspecified">Now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/>It stimulated the nerves, it produced another pulsation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>The throbbings went on, and <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00449.04151" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> returned to the world he had almost quitted forever.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>Another morning I was at my hotel, having left the house after <time value="12am">midnight</time>. At about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> I was wakened, and a note was handed me from <persName n="Grant,Colonel,,,," id="n0262.0049.00449.04152" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>It contained only the word <q direct="unspecified">Come.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>I knew too well what this must mean, and hurried to the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>A hemorrhage had occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> of the contingencies that had always been foreseen, and it was supposed certainly would be fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> had been summoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/><q direct="unspecified">What shall I say?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>asked <persName n="Grant,Colonel,,,," id="n0262.0049.00449.04153" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, as he wrote the notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/><q direct="unspecified">It makes no difference,</q> said the doctor; <q direct="unspecified">all will be over before they get here.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4932"/>But <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00449.04154" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> walked to the basin and helped to wash his throat, and the hemorrhage proved favorable instead of fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>It was caused by the <pb id="p.450" n="450"/> loosening of a slough that had formed over a part of the throat, and the slough in a day or <num value="2">two</num> came entirely away, after which the cancer itself was eased, and indeed for a while arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>The weakness, for some cause or by some means which I have never been able to understand, was to a certain extent overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4935"/>The anodynes were lessened in quantity, and their injurious effects in part passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4936"/>For several days <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00450.04155" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> seemed to hover between life and death, and then came a marvelous change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4937"/>To the amazement of all, his strength returned and his spirits revived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he disbelieved in the amelioration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4939"/>He had perhaps for <num value="1">one</num> moment a glimmer of hope, but then the conviction overwhelmed him that recovery was impossible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4940"/>At this crisis he did not wish to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4941"/><q direct="unspecified">The doctors are responsible <num value="3">three</num> times,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">for my being alive, and&mdash;unless they can cure me&mdash;I don't thank them.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4942"/>He had no desire to go through the agony again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>For, he had suffered death; he had parted with his family; he had undergone every physical pang that could have come had he died before the brandy was administered.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>It seemed to me then cruel to bring him back only to renew his torture; for I had no idea, nor had any <num value="1">one</num> else, that he would live more than a week, if so long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>He had said more than once: <q direct="unspecified">I have no regrets, except for leaving my family.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>But he was recalled, and from that time the apparent improvement went on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>He still, however, for a few days remained unwilling to live&mdash;in pain; though always eager to be cured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4948"/>He was never afraid to die. Having disposed of his book and his affairs, these matters he considered settled; just as in battle, after giving an order, he never doubted, or wished to recall it. But the fighting spirit, the unconquerable nature, made him struggle still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>The dejection which marks the disease, and which had been so appalling in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>, did not return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>In its stead a new phase came on. He was <pb id="p.451" n="451"/> battling again, and this time harder than before, for the enemy was closer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>He fairly grappled and wrestled now with Death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>Once or twice his opponent got him down, but <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00451.04156" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> arose almost stronger in his agony than the <num value="1">One</num> who is stronger than us all. The terrible calm of the fight was exactly like the determination in the <rs>Wilderness</rs> or before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where I once heard him say: <q direct="unspecified">I feel as sure of taking <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> as I do of dying.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>There was no excitement, no hysterical grief or fear, but a steady effort of vital power, an impossibility for his spirit to be subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>He was not resigned; neither was he hopeful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>He simply, because he could not help himself, made every effort to conquer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>After every paroxysm of mortal faintness the indomitable soul revived, and aroused the physical part.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>I may not be thought to lift too far the veil from a dying chamber if I mention <num value="1">one</num> circumstance which had for me a peculiar interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>During all of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00451.04157" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s illness, down to the hour when his partial recovery began, <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00451.04158" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> never could bring herself to believe that she was about to lose him. A woman with many of those singular premonitions and presentiments that amount almost to superstition, but which yet affect some of the strongest minds, and from which <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00451.04159" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself was certainly not entirely free, she declared always, even at the moment which every <num value="1">one</num> else thought would prove the last, that she could not realize the imminence of the end. Her behavior was a mystery and a wonder to those who knew the depth of the tenderness and the abundance of the affection that she lavished on her great husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>Her calmness and self-control almost seemed coldness, only we knew that this was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>I did not presume, of course, to comment on this apparent stoicism, but once or twice she told me she could not despair; that there was a feeling constantly that this was not to be the last; and even when she wept at the gifts and the words that were thought to be farewells, she was putting up prayers that <pb id="p.452" n="452"/> were full of confidence, and after which the wonderful and unexpected recuperation occurred.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>All this while, the public interest was painful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>So much of it penetrated into that house under the shadow of Death, that it seemed to us within as if the whole world was partaking of our sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>All day through the half-closed shutters we could see the crowds waiting silently and solemnly for news of the beloved sufferer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> who left the house was instantly accosted, not only by professional reporters, but by earnest and often weeping men and women, who had never known <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00452.04160" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> personally, but shared the feeling of the country in his behalf.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>To me there chanced to come peculiar indications of this feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>Known to be an inmate of the house, and yet not so near as the nearest relatives, I could be approached by others on subjects which they shrank from broaching to the sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00452.04161" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> belonged to the country as well as to his family, and the country would insist on doing him every honor when the final occasion came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>Many public men endeavored to ascertain through me what would be the wishes of the family in regard to the disposition of the great dead; and letters were sent to me to present at the fitting time, offering worthy sepulture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>The people of the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, through their representatives, declared their desire that the revered ashes should rest at the capital of the country, and the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs> of the army, the friend and follower of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00452.04162" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, sent proffers of a place for him at the <name>Soldiers</name>' Home,&mdash;a fitting spot for the last habitation of a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> sent a messenger from <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00452.04163" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:1"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> to say that he would attend in person the august obsequies, and I was requested to communicate in time the probabilities and the arrangements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>All these sad secrets were to me especial signs of the universal grief that kept pace with the still more sacred sorrow which I saw; but I was anxious not to intrude prematurely upon <pb id="p.453" n="453"/> the family the preparations for what seemed then inevitably at hand, and I bore about with me for weeks the knowledge, undisclosed, that armies and presidents were waiting to pay <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00453.04164" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> those honors which to himself would be forever unknown.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>On <date>Easter Sunday</date> he seemed a little easier, though there was still no hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>I went into his room and found him able to listen and even to utter a few words without too much effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4974"/>I had been greatly struck by the universal watching of a nation, almost of a world, at his bedside, and especially by the sympathy from former rivals and political and even personal adversaries; and I recounted to him instances of this magnanimous forgetfulness of old-time enmities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>When I told him of the utterances of <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00453.04165" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> and <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n0262.0049.00453.04166" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, he replied: <q direct="unspecified">I am very glad to hear this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>I would rather have the good &mdash; will of any man than his ill-will.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/></p> 
<p>On the <dateStruct value="-04-3"><day reg="3">3d</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> several newspapers which had followed <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00453.04167" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> with a persistent animosity down to the very beginning of his illness, recalled in touching and even eloquent words that <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> before he had captured <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on that day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4979"/>I said the nation was looking on now, watching his battle as it did then, and that his fight with disease was as good a <num value="1">one</num> as that he had made with the rebels <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> before.

<p>Toward the last he stammered and hesitated, evidently unwilling at this moment to call any <num value="1">one</num> an enemy; and finally made use of the circumlocution,&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">Those who have not hitherto been regarded as friends.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4999"/>Another morning, only a day or <num value="2">two</num> after his improvement began, he said to me, evidently with a purpose, that it was strange how undisturbed a man could be when so near death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5000"/>He supposed he had been as near the other world as <pb id="p.455" n="455"/> <num value="1">one</num> could be and survive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5001"/>His feeling at the time had been that every moment might be his last; but he had not suffered <num value="1">one</num> particle of apprehension, or fear, or even discomposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5002"/>He evidently wished me to know this, for we had once or twice in the winter talked of religious beliefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5003"/><q direct="unspecified">Yet,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">at such a time it hurts no <num value="1">one</num> to have lived a good life.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5004"/>He had been undisturbed,&mdash;he repeated this emphatically,&mdash;but he believed any <num value="1">one</num> would be more comfortable at such a moment with a conscience that could not reproach him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5005"/>The <dateStruct value="-04-9"><day reg="9">9th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> came, the anniversary of <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>, and recovery was still not assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5006"/><num value="1">One</num> of the sons had a presentiment that his father would not survive that day; but it would have been hard to have <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00455.04181" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> surrender on the anniversary of his greatest victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5007"/>Then came another jubilee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5008"/>His birthday was the <dateStruct value="-04-27"><day reg="27">27th</day> of <month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, and by this time he was so far restored as to be able to join the family for a while at dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5009"/>There were <num value="63">sixty-three</num> lighted candles on the table to celebrate the <measure n="63years" type="date">sixty-three years</measure>, which a month before no <num value="1">one</num> had hoped would ever be completed, and the house was crowded with flowers, the gifts of thankful friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5010"/>By the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> he was so well that he sent for a stenographer, and began to dictate matter for his book.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5011"/>His strength, however, was intermittent, and the cancer soon began to make progress again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5012"/>Nevertheless, <num value="1">one</num> crisis was past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5013"/>A new chapter in the disease was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5014"/>He was able now to drive out, and dictated, and sometimes wrote, at intervals during the month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> and the earlier days of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5015"/>His interest in his work seemed keener than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5016"/>It doubtless gave him strength to make a new fight &mdash; a hopeless <num value="1">one</num>, he felt before long, so far as recovery was concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5017"/>Still, there was a respite, and this period, with his usual determination, he employed in the effort to complete his <q direct="unspecified">Memoirs.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5018"/><pb id="p.456" n="456"/></p> 
<p>The secret of this partial recovery is not far to find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5019"/>It was after the great expression of public sympathy that <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00456.04182" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> began to improve, after his place in the affections of the people was restored or resumed that his whole nature, moral and physical, became inspired and renovated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5020"/>For this it was almost worth while to have suffered,&mdash;to have the world recognize his sensitiveness, and to receive himself its appreciation in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5021"/>Few men, indeed, have known in advance so nearly the verdict of posthumous fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5022"/>No deathbed was ever so illumined by the light of universal affection and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5023"/><persName n="Garfield,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00456.04183" reg="mostcommon:Garfield,A.,,,:1"><surname>Garfield</surname></persName> had not the same claims on his countrymen, and the feeling for him was pity and indignant grief rather than gratitude or lofty enthusiasm; <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00456.04184" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:7"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> knew nothing of the shock that went round the world at his assassination; <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> lived before the telegraph; and no <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> monarch or patriot was ever so universally recognized in his last moments as a savior and hero as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00456.04185" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5024"/>All this was borne in to him as he sat struggling with Death, and, like the giant of old, he received new strength from his contact with earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5025"/>The consciousness of a world for spectators might, indeed, nerve any combatant; and when he found that the attacks on his fame were parried, the reproaches forgotten, his very mistakes lost sight of in the halo that enveloped him, he gathered himself up for a further contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5026"/>The physicians, doubtless, did their part, and nothing that science or devotion could suggest was withheld; but neither science nor devotion expected or produced the resurrection and return of him whose very tomb had been prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5027"/>It was the sense of humiliation that had stricken him and had more to do with his prostration than disease; and when this was removed, he rose from the embrace of the <rs>King</rs> of Terrors, and flung himself for a while into new toils and battles, and, though wounded and bleeding, refused to die.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5028"/>On the <dateStruct value="-06-16"><day reg="16">16th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> he was removed to <placeName reg="Mount McGregor">Mount McGregor</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Schuylerville, Saratoga, New York" key="tgn,7014490">Saratoga</placeName>, where a cottage had been offered him by its <pb id="p.457" n="457"/> owner, <persName n="Drexel,Mister,Joseph,W.,," id="n0262.0049.00457.04186" reg="default:Drexel,Joseph,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Drexel</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5029"/>His strength had so far lapsed that the physicians afterward declared he could not have lived a week longer in the heats and sultriness of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5030"/>When the fatigues of the journey were over, however, and there was time for the fresh and reviving air of his new situation to affect him, his spirits rallied, and he resumed his literary labor with extraordinary energy for a man in his condition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5031"/>I was not with him at <placeName reg="Mount McGregor">Mount McGregor</placeName>, but I know that his effort there must have been prodigious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5032"/>He probably dictated or composed more matter in the <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> after the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> than in any other <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> of his life; while in the <measure n="8weeks" type="date">eight weeks</measure> immediately preceding that date he did not compose as many pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5033"/>But the dying General seemed to summon back his receding powers, and expression, memory, will, all revived and returned at his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5034"/>His voice failed him, however, after a while, and he was obliged to desist from dictation and to use a pencil, not only in composition, but even in communicating with his family and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5035"/>This was doubtless a hardship at the moment, but was fortunate in the end for his fame; for the sentences jotted down from time to time were preserved exactly as they were written, and many of them are significant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5036"/>They especially indicate his recognition of the magnanimous sympathy offered him by Southerners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5037"/>This recognition was manifest in a score of instances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5038"/>He was visited at <placeName reg="Mount McGregor">Mount McGregor</placeName> by <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00457.04187" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, the <rs>Confederate</rs> commander who had surrendered to him at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, and he declared to his former enemy, <q direct="unspecified">I have witnessed since my sickness just what I wished to see ever since the war&mdash;harmony and good feeling between the sections.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5039"/>To <persName n="Douglas,Doctor,,,," id="n0262.0049.00457.04188" reg="mostcommon:Douglas,J.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Douglas</surname></persName> he expressed the same sentiment in nearly the same words: <q direct="unspecified">I am thankful for the providential extension of my time, because it has enabled me to see for myself the happy harmony which so suddenly sprung up between those engaged but a few short years <pb id="p.458" n="458"/> ago in deadly conflict.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5040"/>These utterances were not left to a fading or faulty memory to gather up, but remain legible in the handwriting of their author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5041"/>They form a fitting sequel to the acts of <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00458.04189" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5042"/>Certainly it never happened to a conqueror before to reap such a harvest of appreciation and even affection from the men that he subdued; to accomplish in his death more of the aim of his life than even the victories of his life had achieved.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5043"/>He saw few friends at this time, and did little besides write and obey the directions of his physicians, or submit to the attentions of his family and nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5044"/>His suffering, fortunately, was not greater than that of a patient in any ordinary lingering illness; it proceeded principally from weakness, for the opiates always controlled the excruciating pains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5045"/>These he was spared to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5046"/>He perhaps once or twice had a glimmer of hope, but the rays were faint and quickly faded back into the obscurity of despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5047"/>He felt that he was working only to finish his self-appointed task.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5048"/>For he had an intense desire to complete his <q direct="unspecified">Memoirs.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>It was upon the sale of his book that he counted for the future fortune of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5050"/>It was indeed for his family, not for his fame, that he was laboring now; his fame he felt was secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5051"/>But at his death his army pay would cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5052"/>There would remain to <persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0049.00458.04190" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> and his children, it is true, the <orgName n="Trust Fund" type="fund">Trust Fund</orgName>, the income of which he had authority to dispose of by will; but besides this and the mortgaged house in <address><street n="66 Street">Sixty-sixth street</street></address>, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> inconsiderable properties elsewhere, there was nothing; and <num value="3">three</num> families depended on him. His Personal Memoir, it was hoped, would bring in half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars; but when he had ceased to work in the winter, this was little more than half completed, and the monetary value of the book would be greatly depreciated, if it must be concluded by any hand but his own. This was the consideration that strengthened the sinking soldier, that gave him courage to contend with fate and despair, and, <pb id="p.459" n="459"/> stricken as he was by <num value="1">one</num> of the most terrible of maladies, to check the advance of Death himself, while he made his preparations under the very shadow of the wing and the glare of the scythe of the <name>Destroyer</name>, to secure a competence for his family after he himself should have left this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5053"/>The spectacle of the hero who had earned and worn the highest earthly honors, working amid the miseries of a sick-chamber to glean the gains that he knew he could never enjoy,&mdash;the fainting warrior propped up on that mountain-top to stammer out utterances to sell for the benefit of his children,&mdash;is a picture to which history in all her annals can find no parallel.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5054"/>Indeed, this simple, plain, and undramatic man, who never strove for effect, and disliked the demonstration of feeling as much as the parade of circumstance and power, was performing the most dramatic part before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5055"/>His whole life had been a drama, in spite of him, full of surprises and startling results and violent contrasts, but nothing in it all was more unexpected than this last scene, this eager haste, not in business nor in battle, but in literary labor: this race with Death, this effort to finish a book in order to secure a fortune for his family.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5056"/>But there was a key to the mystery, a solution of the riddle, and it is the explanation of every apparent mystery in the character of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00459.04191" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5057"/>His character at bottom was like that of other men. He loved and hated; he suffered and enjoyed; he appreciated what was done for and against him; he relished his fame and his elevation, he felt his disappointments and his downfall; his susceptibilities were keen, his passions strong; but he had the great faculty of concealing them so that those closest and acutest could seldom detect their existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5058"/>I sometimes wondered whether he was conscious of his own emotions, they were so completely under control; but they were all there, all alive, all active, only enveloped in a cloak of obstinate reserve and <pb id="p.460" n="460"/> majestic silence which only at the rarest intervals was torn aside by misfortune or lifted for a moment to a friend.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5059"/>And now he may himself have been but half aware of the sentiment that inspired him; but since he had discovered that his personal honor was as clean, and his military fame as brilliant in the eyes of men as either had ever been, he determined that his reputation for wordly sense and shrewdness should also be redeemed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5060"/>He would not die without regaining a fortune equal to that which had been wrung from him by fraud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5061"/>No man should say that after all <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0049.00460.04192" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> left his children penniless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5062"/>Away down in the depths of his nature where neither affection nor friendship ever penetrated, except by the intuitions of a life-long intimacy,&mdash; this was the incentive that poured oil on the flames which the disease was quenching, this was the fuel that kept the worn-out machine still in motion, to the amazement of a world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5063"/>When the work was over, the energy expired; when the motive was withdrawn, the effort ceased; when the influence that was the impetus of the machine was exhausted, will and strength alike failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5064"/>Immediately after the end of the book was reached, the other end was seen to be at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5065"/><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> spasmodic bursts of life flared up, like gusts of an expiring fire, but they probably deceived not even himself, and certainly no <num value="1">one</num> besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5066"/>His former indifference to life returned as soon as his task was accomplished.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5067"/>The country too had no wish that he should linger on in agony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5068"/>If he could have been restored to health and strength, nothing that the nation could have done to secure that end would have been lacking, or been thought too costly; but now that he could never be more than a sufferer, prostrate and hopeless, there was no desire to retain him. Reverent sorrow and sympathy had long ascended from every quarter of the land toward the cottage on that mountain-top, but there were no prayers uttered for protracted days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5069"/><pb id="p.461" n="461"/></p> 
<p>The final crisis was neither long nor painful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5070"/>On the <dateStruct value="-07-21"><day reg="21">21st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> the country was informed that he was failing again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>For <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> his symptoms indicated increasing depression and exhaustion, and on the <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num> came the end. There was no renewed struggle, no distinct consciousness on his part that his feet were wet with the waters of that river which we all must cross; he made no formal parting again with his family; he endured no pangs of dissolution, but passed away quietly without a groan or a shudder, with no <num value="1">one</num> but his wife and children and his medical attendants by his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>He had done most of the great things of his life with calmness and composure, and in the same way he entered the long procession in which <persName><foreName>Alexander</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00461.04193" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00461.04194" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n0262.0049.00461.04195" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:3"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> had preceded him. </p></div1>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>I was so closely and almost incessantly by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0050.00462.04199" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s side in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of our intercourse that I received hardly any letters from him during that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5075"/>Our correspondence can hardly be said to have begun until I went to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1869--"><year reg="1869">1869</year></dateStruct>, immediately after he became <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5076"/>Even then his letters were infrequent; I wrote to him, except when I was in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, once or twice a month during his Presidential terms, but I always sent my letters unsealed and under cover to his private secretaries, <persName n="Porter,General,,,," id="n0262.0050.00462.04200" reg="mostcommon:Porter,Horace,,,:7"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> and <persName n="Babcock,General,,,," id="n0262.0050.00462.04201" reg="mostcommon:Babcock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Babcock</surname></persName>, and his reply was usually contained in the letters they wrote to me; of these I have several <num value="100">hundred</num>, but they of course are in the language of the writers, and comprise many other matters besides the messages of <persName n="Grant,President,,,," id="n0262.0050.00462.04202" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5077"/>But after his arrival in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> his intimacy with me was renewed and deepened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5078"/>He passed several weeks at my house, and I accompanied him, with rare exceptions, wherever he went, both in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, and during his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Continental tour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5080"/>During this period he gave me <pb id="p.463" n="463"/> more of his confidence than ever before, and treated me with a familiarity I had not enjoyed either during the war or in the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> afterward in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName>, or during my visits to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> while he was <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5083"/>We were often among those whose language he did not speak; his son <persName n="Jesse,,,,," id="n0262.0050.00463.04204" reg="mostcommon:Jesse,nomatch:0"><surname>Jesse</surname></persName>, who was of the party, was too young to be really a companion, and for months I was the only man who could talk with him on terms of intimacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5084"/>We discussed all his military record hundreds of times, and he read and revised repeatedly the portions of his history on which I was then engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5085"/>We talked of his political career, and he told me many of the events of his Presidency that had occurred while I was separated from him. He understood fully my intention to write his civil history, and allowed me to ask any questions upon disputed points; and I could never perceive that he withheld a complete reply, or was unwilling to give me his opinion on any public event of his career, or his judgment of any man with whom he had ever been associated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5086"/>But it was in purely personal matters that I got closer still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5087"/>In what affected his character or feeling he allowed me to probe him strangely, as well as to suggest an isolated step or outline a general conduct for the present or future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5088"/>Of course he often did not follow my suggestions, but he was never offended at them, and I felt that in many matters I was able to influence his action, both during his <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> tour and in the years that I passed in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> after his and my return.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5089"/>These letters are the proof and illustration of what I say, as well as of what has preceded in this volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5090"/>I give them in their chronological order, prefacing or adding such remarks <pb id="p.464" n="464"/> of my own as may be necessary to explain the circumstances under which they were written or the opinions they contain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5091"/>They may sometimes suggest to me other facts or utterances of importance or interest, and these comments of mine will serve, I trust, as a thread to bind the letters together and give a certain unity to the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5092"/>About half a dozen of the letters have already been printed entire in the earlier pages of this volume, where they peculiarly illustrate the theme or vindicate its treatment; but I have thought it better to repeat them in the complete series than to interrupt the continuity, for toward the close the letters will be found almost to form a connected narrative.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5093"/>They contain so many references to my own affairs that in order to make them intelligible I have been obliged to say more of myself and my concerns than would otherwise be delicate or desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5094"/>But whatever explains or elucidates <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0050.00464.04205" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s language I have supposed would be interesting to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5095"/>In the same spirit I have left unchanged a few passages that may give pain, rather than mutilate his letters or misrepresent his feelings or opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5096"/><persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0050.00464.04206" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> will be so prominent a figure in history that personal considerations become insignificant in the attempt to portray him in his habit as he lived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5097"/>There are few men, however, whose private letters would bear such public inspection, or in whose intimate thoughts and expressions the world can find so little to criticize or friends so little to wish unsaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5098"/>This disclosure will reveal nothing to <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0050.00464.04207" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s dishonor, and no more faults will be found than every <num value="1">one</num> has already known that he possessed as the common lot of humanity; while no <num value="1">one</num> can read this correspondence carefully without obtaining not only a better insight into his character, but a profounder impression of his personal and public virtues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5099"/>To me the more intimately I knew him the more he became the object of affection and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5100"/>His very weaknesses made him <pb id="p.465" n="465"/> seem more human, and his excellences were never diminished by being studied close at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5101"/>He was greater and better in my eyes than to any of those who stood further off and were blinded either by the mists of their own passions or the halo of his position and deeds.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5102"/><num value="1">One</num> word more: although <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n0262.0050.00465.04208" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was so reticent and almost secretive with individuals, he was not so with the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5103"/>He was willing for much to be known about himself that he could not bring himself to utter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5104"/>He never suggested that <num value="1">one</num> word I wrote about his personal characteristics in my <q direct="unspecified">Military History</q> or in a political memoir on which this work is founded, should be omitted or changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5105"/>He listened in advance to an article in <hi rend="italics">The Century Magazine</hi> for <dateStruct value="1885-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct>, in which I disclosed and discussed many of his most peculiar qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5106"/><persName n="Grant,Mrs.,,,," id="n0262.0050.00465.04209" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Nellie,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> suggested and he sanctioned a paragraph for that article, about his family relations, which was so personal that the editor struck it out and refused to publish it, although I protested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5107"/>He read and revised the paper I wrote for the <hi rend="italics">New York Mail and Express</hi> in <dateStruct value="1885--"><year reg="1885">1885</year></dateStruct>, describing the origin of his <q direct="unspecified">Memoirs</q>; and in those memoirs themselves he showed himself willing to disclose details of his life and character and sentiment quite as sacred as any that I have revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5108"/>I believe that, with the portraiture which this volume affords the subject himself would be satisfied, could he know its character and its effect upon his fame.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6867"/>The letter referred to reached my office in my absence from the city, and was placed in a private desk and never came to my attention until it was handed to me by a staff-officer on the cars whilst on my way to <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> early in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6868"/>I put the letter in my pocket expecting to answer it while in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6869"/>Not finding time there, however, the letter remained pocketed and has either been mislaid or lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6870"/>I will answer the letter from memory, as far as possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6871"/>I have no recollection of any conversation in <placeName reg="Springfield, Hampden, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014531">Springfield, Mass.</placeName>, or elsewhere during last summer, in which your name was mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6872"/>I am often questioned, however, about this officer and that <num value="1">one</num> and in such cases endeavor not to do them injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6873"/>Conversations are rarely quoted correctly and in the case referred to by you I know could not have been, for I am made to say things which I never believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6874"/>For instance in regard to your want of ability to command in the presence of an enemy or in battle.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6875"/>I have always thought, and frequently expressed the opinion that in that precise case you would do as well as almost any General that could be selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6876"/>I did receive a telegraphic dispatch from <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n0262.0051.00575.05227" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName>, dated more than <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> before the attack at <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburgh Landing, Tenn.</placeName>, from which or from the courier bringing it I gathered the idea saying that you were within <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> march of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and would be up in that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6877"/>That dispatch was telegraphed to your care, if I remember rightly, and sent by you to me by courier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6878"/>At all events, the dispatch came by way of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> to the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> commanded by you and thence to me by courier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6879"/>This fact I may have mentioned and drawn the conclusion that if you had been up in the time mentioned or double the time, that instead of being attacked I would have taken the initiative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6880"/>On the subject of your heart never <pb id="p.576" n="576"/> having been in the cause I must certainly have been entirely misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6881"/>I supposed you to be as earnest at the beginning of the war, and whilst in command, as any other officer engaged in it in the maintenance of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6882"/>Your own letters published since have rather given the idea that you wanted the <rs>Union</rs> saved in a particular way, and that way different from the <num value="1">one</num> which was being pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6883"/>I drew such a conclusion from them and state so frankly, although I have no recollection of ever having mentioned the fact in such a way as to have my opinion get into print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6884"/>But if I did, what I may have said was based upon your own writing, or what purported to be, and which the whole community had access to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6885"/>I do not remember any of the other points alluded to in the newspaper article which you sent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6886"/>I have in the course of the war been the subject of very severe newspaper criticisms, and never appealed to the press for vindication and now very much dislike to be called on to deny or affirm the statements of some irresponsible reporter without the slightest idea of who he is. But I shall always be much more ready to correct an injustice done another than if I were the injured party.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6901"/>For <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0262.0051.00577.05242" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> was always anxious about the effect of his rhetoric, although the anxiety never induced him to restrain its violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6902"/>He was somewhat hysterical, even womanish in his temperament, as men of his type of genius often are. He suffered and enjoyed acutely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6903"/>An orator, a student, a lover of pictures and books and society, he was confident in the graces and charms of his person and behavior, and both were distinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6904"/>His face and form were full of noble, <pb id="p.578" n="578"/> manly beauty, and his manner was attractive and sometimes irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6905"/>In the latter part of his life he was used to the adulation of a select circle which wafted incense to him as worshipers do to a demi-<name n="God" type="God">god</name>, and he snuffed it up eagerly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6906"/>I have seen clever women&mdash;women with names that are known in literature and society, literally sitting at his feet and waiting to catch every syllable that dropped from his lips&mdash;lips full of elegant and sometimes eloquent language, in conversation as well as public speech.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6907"/>He had a certain flow of not very original ideas and images, an impassioned, though somewhat stilted manner and utterance, and a rhetorical arrangement of expression that captivated many and deceived himself as well as others into the belief that his oratory was of a higher order than was really the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6908"/>It smelt too much of the lamp.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6909"/>His history also excited an interest that was adventitious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6910"/>He had been ostracized in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> society, and for a long time in <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 27" reg="washington, district of columbia">Washington</placeName> as well, because of his anti-slavery sentiment, and to the last there were many who refused to receive or invite him&mdash;even after his marriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6911"/>But the dastardly attack of <persName n="Brooks,,,,," id="n0262.0051.00578.05243" reg="mostcommon:Brooks,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooks</surname></persName> evoked a general sympathy which the continued suffering of the victim kept alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6912"/>Then when the war broke out and the opinions that <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0262.0051.00578.05244" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> had advocated became triumphant he was naturally looked upon as a leader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6913"/>But he was never fitted for more than oratory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6914"/>He was no statesman, no practical man in affairs, and as opposite as possible in quality and character to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0051.00578.05245" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6915"/>Neither indeed could fully understand or appreciate the other, although each had originally respected the achievements or acquirements that were so unlike his own. But when the egotism of <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n0262.0051.00578.05246" reg="nearbymention:Sumner,Charles,,,"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> came in contact with the stubbornness of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0262.0051.00578.05247" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> the result was inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6917"/>It was a pity that men who had both done <pb id="p.579" n="579"/> honor to the <rs>State</rs> at the critical hour of its existence should afterward have been thrown into such antagonism; but their strife was so bitter and their passions became so aroused that the excellence of each was obscured to the other's view; and neither at last could admit or perceive the merit of him with whom he contended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6918"/>Nevertheless of the <num value="2">two</num>, the man of deeds did far more justice to his antagonist than the man of words; and naturally the man of action conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7006"/>It is an undisputed principle of International law that a nation cannot blockade its own ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7007"/>Blockades can only be established against an <hi rend="italics">Enemy</hi>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7008"/>We denied the right of the <rs>French</rs> to blockade a port where they exercised sovereignty; their answer was that the coast blockaded was subject to the sovereign of Morocco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7009"/>It was a small matter, and was referred to the king of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>; but the principle was admitted.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7010"/>When the report of your blockade was received in this country, application was made by merchants to the <rs>Government</rs> to know whether they might proceed to the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, and whether they would be protected if they did so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7020"/>The course we did take avoided all risk of such a crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7021"/>We acknowledged the belligerent rights of the <rs>South</rs>, and that <hi rend="italics">acknowledgment</hi> enabled us to acquiesce in your blockade, and to give the immediate answer to our merchants that they were entitled to no protection if they attempted to break the blockade.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7022"/>Surely, so far from our conduct having given any cause of complaint, it ought to have been accepted as the most convincing proof of our anxiety to avoid any risk of rupture with the <rs>North</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7028"/>Unless, however, my memory fails me, she had been employed as a vessel of war, and she left <num value="1">one</num> of your ports fully manned, armed, and equipped for war, proceeded to <placeName key="tgn,2204227" n="1.000 10" reg="Buenos Aires, Pima, Arizona">Buenos Ayres</placeName>, <pb id="p.586" n="586"/> was sold to the <rs>Insurgent Government</rs> ready armed and manned, and acted at once as a Buenos Ayrean vessel of war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7029"/>This your courts decided to be, so far as the equipment, manning, and arming in an <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> port and sale of the vessel so equipped is concerned, to be a legitimate commercial transaction.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7030"/>How far short of this are the circumstances of the <rs>Alabama</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7031"/>She was partly fitted for carrying guns, as any merchantman may fairly be; she was only partly manned when she left <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, apparently for a trial or short trip.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7032"/>It was only after she had got out of <name>English</name> jurisdiction that she was put into that state of full equipment for war in which the <rs>Santissima Trinidad</rs> actually was, when she left the port of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7033"/>Evidently anything which would have brought the <rs>Alabama</rs> within the law was very doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7034"/>There cannot be better proof of this than that when we seized the <rs>Alexandra</rs> we were unable to make our case good in a court of law. We subsequently seized the <name>Rams</name>, of whose warlike character there could be no doubt&mdash; but the proceeding was so questionable in the opinion of the lawyers, that we ultimately bought them in order to avoid going into court.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7035"/>Now, surely it is no just cause of serious complaint that in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> case of the kind with which we had to deal we should have been cautious in taking a step which would in all probability have turned out to be an illegal measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7036"/>That is the <hi rend="italics">utmost</hi> that can be alleged against what we did. Our illegal seizure of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> and of the <name>Rams</name> is proof enough that we had no indisposition to interpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7037"/>Am I unreasonable in thinking that the <rs>Government</rs> of <num value="1">one</num> free country might judge less harshly the conduct of the <rs>Government</rs> of another free country when it hesitates to overstep the boundary of the law.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7038"/>I will not add an unnecessary word to a letter already too long, beyond the assurance of my sincere esteem, and of the pleasure which it would give me if I succeed in showing you how anxious we were to act in such a way as to preserve that attitude of complete neutrality which it was our duty to maintain.</p>
