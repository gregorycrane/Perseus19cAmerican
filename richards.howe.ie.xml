<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Alas! the tender father meant to cherish a vestal flame in a vase of alabaster; in reality, he was trying to imprison the lightning in the cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>When our mother wrote the words above quoted, on the power of music over sensitive natures, she was recalling these days, and perhaps remembering how, denied the society of her natural mates, her <num value="16">sixteen</num>-year-old heart went out in sympathy and compassion to the young harper who came to take part in the trios and quartets, and who fell desperately in love with her and was summarily dismissed in consequence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>It was characteristic of her that the plan once made, the resolve taken, it became an obsession, a thing that must be done at whatever cost.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>She asked her father if she might invite a few friends for a certain evening: he assented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>She engaged the best caterer in New York; the most fashionable musicians; she even hired a splendid cut-glass chandelier to supplement the sober lighting of the yellow drawing-room.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>She could think of nothing but her father's displeasure, of the words he might speak, the glances he might cast upon her. During the whole evening, the cup of trembling was at her lips.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2036"/>It was an heroic time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2037"/>The <rs>Doctor</rs> was in constant touch with the events of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2038"/>When he entered the house, we all felt the electric touch, found ourselves in the circuit of the great current.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2039"/>So, these <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> were notable for us all, especially for our mother; for beside these vital interests, she was entering upon another phase of development.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2040"/>Heretofore her life had been domestic, studious, social; her chief relation with the public had been through her pen. She now felt the need of personal contact with her audience; felt that she must speak her message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2041"/>She says in her <quote>Reminiscences</quote> : <quote>In the days of which I now write, it was borne in upon me (as the <name>Friends</name> say) that I had much to say to my day and generation which could not and should not be communicated in rhyme, or even in rhythm.</quote></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2042"/>The character of the message, too, was changing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2043"/>In the anguish of bereavement she sought relief in study, her lifelong resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2044"/>Religion and philosophy went hand in hand with her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2045"/>But it was not enough for her to receive; she must also give out: her nature was radiant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2046"/>She must formulate a philosophy of her own, and must at least offer it to the world.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2048"/>Too much of my life, indeed, runs in this channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4104"/>The record of this year and the next is a chronicle of arduous work, with the added and ever-deepening note of anxiety; it was only for a time that the visit to <placeName reg="Samana, Republica Dominicana, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005416">Samana</placeName> checked the progress of the <rs>Doctor</rs>'s physical failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4106"/>He felt that this would probably be his last earthly task; yet the following summer found him again taking up the familiar work, laboring with what little strength was left him, and when eyes and hand refused to answer the call of the spirit, dictating <pb id="p.1.355" n="355"/> to his faithful secretary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4107"/>It has been told elsewhere how in this last summer of his life he labored to make more beautiful and more valuable the summer home which had become very dear to him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4109"/>The city had decided to put a street through <placeName reg="Green Peace">Green Peace</placeName>: already workmen were digging trenches and cutting trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4110"/>Our mother went to the authorities, and told them of his feeble condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4111"/>The work was stopped at once, and not resumed during his lifetime.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4112"/>Through these years her time was divided between the invalid and the many public duties which had already taken possession of her life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4113"/>Little by little these were crowded out: instead of lecture or concert came the ever-shortening walk with the <rs>Doctor</rs>, the evening game of whist or backgammon which lightened a little his burden of pain and weariness.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4132"/>With the latter object in view the memoir was necessarily brief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4133"/>The labor of condensing into a small space the record of a long and super-active life was severe, but it was the tonic she needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4161"/>The new domain was that of true womanhood, woman no longer in her ancillary relation to man, but in direct relation to the divine plan and purpose, as a free agent fully sharing with man every human right and every human responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4162"/>This discovery was like the addition of a new continent to the map of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4163"/>It did not come all at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4172"/>In our own and other countries a host of earnest souls were awake, pressing eagerly forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4173"/>In quick succession came the women's clubs and colleges, the renewed demand for woman suffrage, the <name>Association</name> for the <name>Advancement</name> of Women, the banding together of women ministers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4174"/>The hour had come, and the women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4187"/>The idea of woman suffrage had long been repugnant to our mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5949"/>They are liable to be regarded as a non-producing class, supported by those to whom, in the order of nature, their life is a necessary condition of existence itself .... Exhibits like the present, then, are useful in summing up much of this undervalued work of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5950"/>A greater moral use they have in raising the standard of usefulness and activity for the sex in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5951"/>Good work, when recognized, acts as a spur to human energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5952"/>Those who show how women can excel are examples to shame those who do not try. They lay upon their sex an obligation to stronger endeavor and better action, and society gains thereby.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5953"/>Still more have I at heart the association, in these enterprises, of women who are not bound to each other by alliance of blood, or affinity of neighborhood.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9550"/>These sittings were on what she called her boulevard, a grassy space in front of the house, bordering on the road, and taking the full strength of the morning sun. Here, with the tall screen of cedars behind her, and a nut tree spreading its golden canopy over her head, she would sit for hours, drinking in the sweet air that was like no other to her.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9551"/>A companion picture to this is that of the twilight hour, when she would sit alone in the long parlor, looking out on the sunset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9552"/>Black against the glowing sky rose the pines of the tiny forgotten graveyard, where long-ago neighbors slept, with the white rose tree drooping over the little child's grave; a spot of tender and melancholy beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9553"/>All about were the fields she loved, fragrant with clover and wormwood, vocal with time-keeping crickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9554"/>Here she would sit for an hour, meditating, or repeating to herself the <name>Odes</name> of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, or some familiar hymn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9556"/>She knew many of the <name>Odes</name> by heart, and was constantly memorizing new ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9557"/>They filled and brightened many a sleepless or weary hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9559"/>Now and then she wrote down a meditation; here is <num value="1">one</num>:--<quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9560"/></p> 
<p>A thought comes to me to-day which gives me great comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9561"/>This is that, while the transitory incidentals of our life, important for the moment, pass out of it, the steadfast divine life which is in our earthly experience, perseveres, and can never die nor diminish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9562"/>I feel content that much of me should die. I interpret for myself <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0221.0032.00002.03370" reg="nearbymention:Christ,Jesus,,,"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>'s parable of the tares sown in the wheat field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9563"/>As regards the individual, these tares are our personal and selfish traits and limitations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9564"/>We must restrain and often resist them, but we cannot and must not seek to eradicate them, for they are important agents not only in preserving, but also in energizing our bodily life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9565"/>Yet they are, compared with our higher life, as the tares compared with the wheat, and we must be well content to feel that, when the death harvest comes, these tares will fall from us and perish, while the wheat will be gathered into the granary of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9566"/>I do not desire ecstatic, disembodied sainthood, because I do not wish to abdicate any <num value="1">one</num> of the attributes of my humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9567"/>I cherish even the infirmities that bind me to my kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9568"/>I would be human, and American, and a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9569"/>Paul of <placeName key="tgn,7002623" n="1.000 1" reg="tarsus,icel ili,akdeniz kiyisi,turkiye,asia">Tarsus</placeName> had <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> ecstasies, but I feel sure that he lived in his humanity, strenuously and energetically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9570"/>Indeed, the list he gives us of his trials and persecutions may show us how much he lived as a man among men, even though he did once cry out for deliverance from the body of <pb id="p.2.384" n="384"/> death, whose wants and pains were a sore hindrance to him in his unceasing labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9571"/>That deliverance he found daily in the service of Truth, and finally once for all, when <name n="God" type="God">God</name> took him.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9572"/>Another thought upholds me. With the recurrence of the cycle, I feel the steady tramp and tread of the world's progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9573"/>This Spring is not identical with last Spring, this year is not last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9574"/>The predominant fact of the <name>Universe</name> is not the mechanical round and working of its forces, but their advance as moral life develops out of and above material life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9575"/>Mysterious as the chain of causation is, we know <num value="1">one</num> thing about it, viz.: that we cannot reverse its sequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9576"/>Whatever may change or pass away, my father remains my father, my child, my child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9577"/>The way before us is open -the way behind us is blocked with solid building which cannot be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9578"/>And in this great onward order, life turns not back to death, but goes forward to other life, which we may call immortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9579"/>If I would turn backward, I stand still in paralyzed opposition to the mighty sweep of heavenly law. It must go on, and if I could resist and refuse to go with it, I should die a moral death, having isolated myself from the movement which is life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9580"/>But, do what I will, I cannot resist it. I am carried on perforce, as inanimate rocks and trees are swept away in the course of a resistless torrent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9581"/>Shall I then abdicate my human privilege which makes the forces of nature Angels to help and minister to me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9582"/>Let me, instead, take hold of the guiding cords of life with resolute hands and press onward, following the illustrious army whose <pb id="p.2.385" n="385"/> crowned chiefs have gone before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9583"/>They too had their weakness, their sorrow, their sin. But they are set as stars in the firmament of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and their torches flash heavenly light upon our doubtful way, ay, even upon the mysterious bridge whose toll is silence.
