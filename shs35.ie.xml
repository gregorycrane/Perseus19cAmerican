<p>When, on the <dateStruct value="1864-05-5"><day reg="5">5th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month>, <year>1864</year>,</dateStruct> the disturbing news was brought to the city of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 5" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> that a formidable army, with <persName n="Butler,General,Benjamin,F.,," id="n0293.0002.00002.00011" reg="default:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Benjamin</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> as its commander, had landed at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundred, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2110639">Bermuda Hundred</placeName>, within a few hours' easy march of the town, the greatest consternation prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The practically defenceless situation of the town, guarded, as it was, by a few <num value="100">hundred</num> regular soldiers, and about the same number of untried and raw militia, was well calculated to excite the worst apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The reputation and character of the <rs>Federal</rs> general enhanced the universal feeling of alarm.</p></div1>

<head>Everybody to help.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In the emergency every man capable of bearing, arms was called upon to aid in the general defense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In a few hours I found myself with several <num value="100">hundred</num> citizens reporting for duty on <address><street n="Bank Street">Bank Street</street></address>, opposite the <orgName><rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>'s office</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As speedily as possible, we were supplied with such arms and accoutrements as were then available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The muskets were chiefly old <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName> flint-locks, which had recently been altered to percussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They had, in all probability, seen service in the <rs>War</rs> of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, for although percusion caps had been invented by a Scotch parson and patented by him in <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct>, they had not been generally adopted by the armies of the world until about <dateStruct value="1840--"><year reg="1840">1840</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They were dangerous weapons at close quarters, but at modern rifle range, to use the late <persName n="Keiley,,A.,M.,," id="n0293.0003.00002.00012" reg="expanded:Keiley,Anthony,M.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Keiley</surname></persName>'s suggestive similitude, <q direct="unspecified">not worth a tinker's imprecation.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/></p> 
<p>Armed with these antiquated firearms, we marched down the <rs type="place">City Point Road</rs> to <placeName reg="Jordan's Farm">Jordan's Farm</placeName>, some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We were a motley crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>No uniforms, battleflags, or shimmering bayonets invested us with the pomp, pride and circumstance of war. There were wanting even the shrill tootings of the fife and the taps of the drum to excite our martial enthusiasm, but there existed in the breasts of all, not that ardor which seeks only the <q direct="unspecified">bubble reputation,</q> but what was better, the earnest and determined resolve at all hazards and at all odds to defend their homes, their altars and their firesides. </p></div1>

<head>Getting in trenches.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Jordan's Farm">Jordan's Farm</placeName>, we entered upon an open field extending from some hilly ground on our right over towards the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A line of entrenchments thrown up at an earlier period of the war ran across this open space till they touched the riverside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was now apparent we had to defend this line of works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>As yet we had seen no sign of cannon or regular soldiers to reinforce our band of untried men, but we prepared ourselves for the worst that might happen.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was understood that a night attack might be made, and as the shades of night drew on we were formed into line, and the command given: <q direct="unspecified">Forward, men, into the trenches.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> signal to us to contribute our mite in deadly earnest to the war that was waging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>That night we slept on our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Overcome by fatigue, our slumbers were profound.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>During the night I heard the calm, authoritative voice of some general officer giving orders, but nothing happened to disturb our dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Fortunately, it was the balmy month of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and which we had no canopy over our heads, save the blue vault of heaven, with its pyramids of stars looking down upon us, we suffered no ill effects from the exposure, though many had passed the meridian of life.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The enemy had not put in an appearance, and many succeeding days passed before we heard the sound of his guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We were now told off into companies, and were regularly installed into camp life, drilled in company evolutions and exercised in the manual of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In the organization thus effected I found myself attached to <orgName type="company" n="Company B">Company B</orgName>, <persName n="Wolfe,Captain,James,E.,," id="n0293.0004.00003.00013" reg="default:Wolfe,James,E.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Wolfe</surname></persName>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-class militia.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He soon found he had caught a Tarter in <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n0293.0005.00003.00017" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and after the severe defeat he sustained at his hands, the military nerves of our modern <persName n="Achilles,,,,," id="n0293.0005.00003.00018" reg="mostcommon:Achilles,nomatch:0"><surname>Achilles</surname></persName> were so unstrung that he had no stomach for any further fighting at that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <orgName n="Richmond Examiner" type="newspaper">Richmond Examiner</orgName> of the day indeed <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> aptly compared <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n0293.0005.00004.00019" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> to a <q direct="unspecified">turkey buzzard matched against a great gyr falcon,</q> and the result proved the truth of its prognostications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Finding that the enemy did not appear to be disposed to molest us, many went back to their various occupations, but ready to be called upon at a moment's warning, and so it happened that on the fateful day our force was considerably diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>During this time, however, we were marched from <num value="1">one</num> point to another on the lines, finding ourselves at last doing duty on the farm of <persName n="Rives,Mister,Timothy,,," id="n0293.0005.00004.00020" reg="default:Rives,Timothy,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Timothy</foreName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>, on the <rs type="place">Jerusalem Plank Road</rs>, south of the town.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>During the interim we were employed in the usual avocations of camp life-drilling, doing guard and picket duty; when not thus engaged, amusing ourselves as best we might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Quoit throwing was a favorite pastime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I do not remember that cards were indulged in our company at least, as there was amongst us quite a sprinkling of elderly men, deacons and elders of churches, not usually given to such worldly recreations.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>News regularly reached us, of course, of the heroic deeds of that noble <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, whose wonderful victories against tremendous odds excited our unbounded admiration and the wonder of the civilized world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We had an oracle in camp whose fertile brain found ample scope for the exercise of his peculiar talents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He could draw diagrams, locate armies, make flank movements, and show to a very sympathetic audience how <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n0293.0005.00004.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> would whip them again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Indeed, many believed that that peerless commander would hurl back his enemies once more to the <rs>Potomac</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><num value="1">One</num> night when on picket near &mdash; the railroad, sitting around a blazing camp-fire, our oracle exclaimed with unwonted enthusiasm: <q direct="unspecified">I could take a dozen of you fellows over to your breastworks and keep back a whole regiment of <placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This was very amusing, but it seems something like prophecy as to what did occur later on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The fateful day at length drew near.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>That the very safety of the homes of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 5" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Petersburg</placeName> was imperiled, if not their lives, the following extract from orders given to the <rs>Federal</rs> <persName n="Hicks,General,,,," id="n0293.0006.00005.00027" reg="mostcommon:Hicks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName> by <persName n="Gilmore,General,,,," id="n0293.0006.00005.00028" reg="nearbymention:Gilmore,Q.,A.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gilmore</surname></persName> will abundantly prove: <q direct="unspecified">Should you penetrate the town before <persName n="Kautz,General,,,," id="n0293.0006.00005.00029" reg="nearbymention:Kautz,August,V.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Kautz</surname></persName>, who is to attack on the <rs type="place">Jerusalem Road</rs>, the public buildings, public stores, bridges across the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, depots and cars are all to be destroyed.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Whether the destruction was to be accomplished by the torch or by explosives, it is evident that a universal conflagration might have ensued during the general distress and confusion.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The camp was immediately in commotion, and by the orders of our commandant, <persName n="Archer,Colonel,Fletcher,H.,," id="n0293.0007.00007.00044" reg="default:Archer,Fletcher,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Fletcher</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName>, the men quickly fell into their places.

The news had reached the city ahead of me; the bells had just ceased ringing the tocsin of alarm and the city was being thoroughly aroused, but as we had often been deceived by false reports, some were disposed to treat the matter lightly, and while some believed and hastened to put their armor on, others believed not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In common with many others, they had returned to their professional duties, ready to be called upon at a moment's notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>School was in session, and as I approached the house, I heard the sound of busy voices within, and when the next moment I stood at the open door, gun in hand, reciting the news, every boy and girl was hushed into silence as they craned their necks <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> to hear what was being said about the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>On the way I met <num value="2">two</num> Confederate soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>From them I derived the information that an attack already had been made and repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I asked them why they didn't stay to help; they gave me as a reason that it was not their company that was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I suspected that, being old veterans and probably foreseeing the result, the real reason was they had no stomach for the fight.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Further on as I reached the cedar lane leading from what was known as the <rs type="place">Ragland House</rs>, to the <rs type="place">Plank Road</rs>, a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in the rear of the works, I saw galloping towards me a youth mounted on a fine-looking mare, and leading by the bridle a large heavy-built, dark horse, with foreign-looking accoutrements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The contrast between the spirited animal he was riding and the other lumbering, clumsy animal, was quite striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>This, I understood afterwards, was gallant young Wales Hurt, lieutenant in <persName n="Jarvis,Captain,,,," id="n0293.0008.00008.00056" reg="mostcommon:Jarvis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Jarvis</surname></persName>' Junior Reserves, on his way for reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>This was the last I saw of him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The news considerably excited me, and I pushed on. It was now very near the middle of the day. On turning into the main road and nearing our camp, which was immediately on the <rs type="place">Plank Road</rs>, and a short distance in the rear of the breastworks, I saw our attenuated line of about <num value="125">one hundred and twenty-five</num> men spread out along the trenches from the salient, or redoubt, in front of or near <placeName reg="Timothy Rives' house">Timothy Rives' house</placeName> on our left, across the <rs type="place">Jerusalem Plank Road</rs>, to a short distance on our right, in front of a pine grove.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>There was no artillery then in position, and I instinctively felt it was a forlorn hope.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I found the men considerably elated at the result of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack, as they described with what beautiful precision the attacking party of cavalry had advanced in front of our works, wheeled and retreated on being fired into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>However, the fiery ordeal had yet to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It was apparent that our commandant, <persName n="Archer,Major,Fletcher,H.,," id="n0293.0008.00009.00060" reg="default:Archer,Fletcher,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Fletcher</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName>, had nevertheless, the utmost we could hope to accomplish was to hold our position until reinforcements arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>At that moment we were the only barrier, feeble as it was, between the city and destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The enemy, now finding we were not be frightened off by the mere brandishing of the weapons of war, proceeded to invest our position according to the most approved military methods, and now opened upon our centre at the <rs type="place">Jerusalem Road</rs>, shelling us vigorously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>At this movement we had no gun in position wherewith to respond to the <name>Rives</name>' salient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Presently the commandant came over and asked for volunteers to help defend the centre of our position, as he expected a fresh dash of the enemy would be made there, which was cheerfully compiled with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>A dozen or <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> so sprang up and went with him. This brought me close to the <rs type="place">Plank Road</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>It took position to the right of the <rs type="place">Plank Road</rs>, and it was with much satisfaction we saw its shells exploding in the midst of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>In order to barricade the roadway more effectually, a number of rails taken from a fence just outside the lines had been placed in and across a wagon drawn across the road at the opening through the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>This was done in full view and easy range of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The enemy having thrown out a line of sharphooters in our front, where they had ample protection behind the bushes and fences, kept our men busily employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>We very shortly noticed the enemy running out to overlap us on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It is well known, and has been well described, what the results of this movement were; how our men at the <name>Rives</name>' salient had to stand a murderous fire upon them on their flank and rear, while facing the enemy in front.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1026"/><rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs> and comrades,&mdash;I have long thought that I would make record of the character and virtues of the negroes before and during the war, and I take advantage of the opportunity afforded me as a member of the <rs>History Committee</rs> to do so as far as I am able.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1027"/>Should I leave the task undone&mdash;or rather did I fall to bear testimony in a public way to the fidelity of the negroes to their masters' familiar at all times, and specially during those dreadful days of the war&mdash;I would not fulfill an obligation to a loyal and devoted people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1028"/>My own experience and that of my father and family and friends was so closely associated with the negroes, and those experiences were so satisfactory and pleasant, I feel impelled by every sense of duty, appreciation and love for my dear old black mammy, as well as for many of the other negroes, old and young, to record such facts as I can. I think it is but simple justice, because I do not believe that any people at any time ever proved themselves more loyal than the negroes did under the temptations that beset and tried them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1029"/>I do not intend to say that all the negroes were good, but in most cases where they were unfaithful they were either wrought up by harsh and cruel treatment by heartless owners, or were incited by evildis-posed, envious, intermeddling incendiaries from the <rs>Northern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1030"/>There was a natural desire, too, upon the part of some of the more intelligent negroes to throw off the yoke of slavery and be free, but as a rule the negroes were loyal to their masters' families and respected and loved them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1031"/>The masters were, as a rule, <pb id="p.61" n="61"/> considerate and just to their slaves, and no stronger proof could be desired than was afforded by the conduct of the slaves generally during the war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1032"/>For months at a time there were numerous families of women and children wholly dependent on the negroes for support and protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1033"/>Those women and children were cut off from their male relations and friends, and yet from the beginning to the end of the war no such thing as an insurrectionary movement was known or heard of, nor the use of any incendiary language whatever charged, reported or hinted against the negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1034"/>As a matter of fact the commands of the smallest child in the master's family were obeyed without a murmur.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1035"/>True, a number of them left or were carried or enticed away and many who went enlisted in the <rs>Federal Army</rs>, but on the other hand, a large majority of them remained at home and actually hid themselves and the stock of their masters whenever they heard the cry, <q direct="unspecified"><placeName reg="Yankees">Yankees</placeName> coming!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1036"/></p> 
<p>This is positively true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1037"/>I could cite numerous instances and name parties were it necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1038"/>Not only did a large majority of the negroes remain at their homes, but they took care of the property and families of their masters, raised crops, and did all other customary and necessary work just as they had before the war, when owners and overseers watched over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1039"/>I personally know instances where the negro men alternately slept on the gallery or before the door of their master's home in order to protect the family against all harm.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1040"/>These are facts that flatly contradict and give the lie direct to the oft repeated assertions of the <name>Abolitionist</name> (slanders on the negroes) that the negroes hated the whites of the <rs>South</rs> and only worked for and obeyed them because they were compelled to do so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1041"/>These are facts, and no matter what may be the outcome of the developing of the future, as a race the negroes by their conduct and their fidelity in times and under circumstances that might well have and did put their allegiance and fidelity to the severest test, earned and entitled themselves to the kind consideration, the friendship and love of our people.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1042"/>True, after the war had ended and they became free their ignorance was imposed upon and many of them allowed themselves <pb id="p.62" n="62"/> to be duped and misled into a feeling of distrust and a course of antagonism to their former owners, and the people of the <rs>South</rs> generally, which came very near causing a rupture that might have resulted in the destruction of all confidence, the severance of all ties and creating a permanent animosity between them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1043"/>I do not envy the men, or fiends, who could take advantage of the ignorant negroes and turn them against the white people and expose them to the possible dangers and evils of a bloody race conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1044"/>The infamies practiced by the carpetbagger engendered the feeling of hatred in the negro's breast, and I firmly believe that but for this we would not have felt the horrors of the so-called <q direct="unspecified">Reconstruction,</q> and that we would have no negro question now. I do not believe that the effect those teachings had on the negroes then will ever be eradicated from the present or future generations, but whatever the future may develop, we must remember the loyalty of our good slaves.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1051"/>Some of the officers claimed their negro servants as personal property, and took them along to prison with them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1052"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName>, the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities assured the negroes they were as free as their masters had been, and were not prisoners of war; that they would give them no rations <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> and no rights as prisoners of war if they went in the prison, but they all elected to go in, and declared to the <rs>Yankees</rs> they would stick to their young masters to the end of time, if they starved to death by doing so.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1053"/>Those Confederate officers, of course, shared their rations and everything else with their servants.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1054"/>When we went in prison in <dateStruct value="1863-08-"><month reg="08">August</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, there was a sutler's shanty in the grounds, where those who had money could purchase what they wanted to eat.

They had failed to influence the negroes, and decided to confine us strictly to prison rations, which were very scant.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1055"/>It was then that the devotion and fidelity of the negroes was put to a test, but without exception, master and servant clung together in heroic sacrifice, and no more wonderful magnetic tie ever existed than that between those Southern officers and their slaves.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2563"/>The historical explanation of the use of this language, disclosed by the work under review, is much more satisfactory.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2564"/>The reasoning of the author, based on the <name>Federalist</name>, the <rs>Madison</rs> papers, the debates of the convention and on what was at the time of such convention know of the history, compacts between, and confederations of, sovereign States, seems conclusive of the proposition that the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> was formed by a compact between the original acceding States, in their capacity as sovereign States, acting for themselves and for the people of the several States, respectively; and that such Constitution was not formed by the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as a whole, acting individually and nationally, with respect to the nationel powers delegated.</p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4553"/>The plain truth is that I had no mission at all, or, if for want of another word it must needs be called so, its conception involved nobody but myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4554"/>The genesis of it and its development are set forth in the following narrative:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>After the successful issue of the <rs>Louisiana</rs> campaign in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, there being no prospects of a speedy renewal of hostilities, and the division I then commanded being in the highest state of efficiency, it occurred to me that I might do some good by conveying information abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4556"/>Letters which I received about that time, having strengthened this opinion, I repaired to <placeName key="tgn,7014504" n="1.000 68" reg="shreveport, caddo, louisiana">Shreveport</placeName> in .the winter of <dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, and suggested to <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n0293.0066.00327.03995" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> the advisability of granting me a <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> leave of absence for the purpose of going abroad and of availing myself of the curiosity and interest which the presence of an active participant in the great struggle now going on could not fail to awaken in foreign parts, in order to enlist sympathy with the <rs>Southern Cause</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4557"/>Nor was my purpose as vague and indefinite as might appear thus far. There was <num value="1">one</num> circumstance which gave it substantiality&mdash;<num value="1">one</num> man who was, so to say, the pivot of my self-imposed task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4558"/>This man was not the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, far less <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, but the <rs>Duke</rs> of Morny, an intimate confidant and devoted friend of the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4559"/><pb id="p.328" n="328"/> As a statesman, he was credited with some shrewdness&mdash;practical, self-possessed, as devoid of enthusiasm as free from prejudice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4560"/>I had some acquaintance with him. I had met him privately several times before leaving <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4561"/>I had introduced to him <num value="1">one</num> of the delegates whom, at an early stage of the conflict, some of the <rs>Southern States</rs> had sent abroad (I believe it was the delegate from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>), and had noticed on every occasion his readiness to receive information and the unbiased, practical view he took of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4562"/>With him I could talk without hindrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4563"/>I could see him privately, informally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4564"/>He could listen to me day after day without in any manner committing his government, ask any questions he liked, and elicit every information more freely from a mere eye-witness, bearing no credentials, than he could do from an authorized representative of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4565"/>Here, then, was an advantage which I intended to turn to account during a temporary absence from the field.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4570"/>It is true that as to the intrinsic nature and merits of the conflict I could only repeat what others had said, yet both <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0293.0066.00328.03998" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> and <persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n0293.0066.00328.03999" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> concurred in the opinion that my acquaintance with the <rs>Duke de Morny</rs> was an interesting feature, which I might well try to turn to good account during a period of anticipated calm, in which my presence among my troops did not appear of absolute necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4571"/>None of us <num value="3">three</num> was over sanguine about the result of my undertaking, and in our wildest flights of fancy never looked to an armed intervention as within the range of human possibilities; but it did not seem impossible to obtain a modification of a sham neutrality, which worked <pb id="p.329" n="329"/> entirely in favor of the <rs>North</rs>, to which a stream of mercenaries from all parts of the world was constantly flowing, and to secure something like equal treatment to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, especially as regarded their navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>He bade me sit opposite him, and during the conversation which ensued evinced much interest in the progress of the war, made many remarks on details connected with the operations in the field, but the political side of the contest was never touched upon.

<p>So much for history!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4612"/>The wonderful array of political intrigues, negotiations, conflicting efforts, and warlike demonstrations, supposed to have taken place in the space of a few weeks, perhaps only of a few days, does infinite credit to the dramatic imagination of the author, as well as to the spirit of enterprise which distinguished this dramatic personage.

<div1 id="c.1.65.85" type="section" n="c.1.65.85"> 
<head>Slavery a Bar to foreign aid.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4620"/>I should feel inclined to think that it is the dream of a dreamer, and that the correspondent of the <orgName n="Washington Post" type="newspaper">Washington Post</orgName> has dreamed it, for I have known all the most prominent men of the <rs>South</rs> and many others who might well come within the designation of <q direct="unspecified">some of the ablest men,</q> and never heard any <num value="1">one</num> of them as much as hint at such a venture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4621"/>Indeed, many of them knew too well that the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> proved the greatest bar to every hope of foreign assistance, and that the establishment of a new slaveholding community with the aid of a foreign power an absolute impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4622"/>But apart from this negative objection, I am able to give information of a positive nature which will point to the same conclusion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4623"/>I have said that while I was at <placeName key="tgn,7014504" n="1.000 68" reg="shreveport, caddo, louisiana">Shreveport</placeName>, preparing for my journey, <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0293.0066.00333.04026" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> had imparted to me a scheme he was then revolving in his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4624"/>I will now disclose it. Seeing that the <rs>South</rs> could not replace its fallen combatants, whereas the <rs>North</rs> disposed of an ever-increasing army of foreign mercenaries; moreover, that whenever the <rs>Federals</rs> obtained temporary possession of Southern soil, they kidnapped the negroes and pressed them into military service, <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0293.0066.00333.04027" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>'s idea was to arm the negroes, and as a consequence to give them their freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4625"/>I remember his very words: <q direct="unspecified">Of course,</q> he said, <q direct="unspecified">we must give them their freedom.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4626"/>Such a plan is obviously incompatible with the notion of a retrocession of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> as a slaveholding community, and some interesting conclusions can be drawn from it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4627"/>In the first place, it shows that a prominent Southern man, thoroughly acquainted with all the conditions of political and social life in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, felt a perfect confidence in the loyalty of the black population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4628"/>Many Northern men would, <pb id="p.334" n="334"/> no doubt, have considered the arming of the slaves as a risky undertaking on the part of the <rs>South</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4629"/>But the history of the war bears out <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0293.0066.00334.04028" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>'s confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4630"/>During the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> the contest lasted no negro outrage or disturbance arising out of the circumstances has to my knowledge been recorded, nor is it possible to deny that the total want of effervescence in the black population in times where every facility for revolt was afforded them bears testimony to and throws light upon the way in which the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> was understood and put into practice in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4631"/>On the other hand, it is impossible to admit that <persName n="Allen,Governor,,,," id="n0293.0066.00334.04029" reg="nearbymention:Allen,H.,W.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName> should have brooded over such a scheme as I have stated had he not conceived at least the possibility of its adoption, and this points to the conclusion that the leading minds in the <rs>South</rs> were, to his knowledge, very far from identifying slavery, in the abstract, with the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4632"/>In corroboration of this inference I would recall:</p>
