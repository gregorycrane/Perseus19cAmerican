<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>Accordingly, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>, I pushed forward <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n0122.0002.00002.00018" reg="nearbymention:Hoke,R.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName>, who upon his arrival at Bachelor's creek, <placeName><distance reg="9miles">nine miles</distance> from <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName></placeName>, was met in strong force by the enemy, although they were evidently surprised; still the night being dark, and the enemy being posted in a strong position, and having destroyed the bridge, it was impracticable for <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n0122.0002.00002.00019" reg="nearbymention:Hoke,R.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName> to force a passage till after daylight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>This he did in most gallant style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>At this time the enemy, reinforcing heavily by railroad and trying to rake our lines with the guns on the steam iron-clads, they attempted to turn my right flank with these reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I threw <persName n="Corse,,,,," id="n0122.0002.00002.00020" reg="mostcommon:Corse,M.,D.,,:1"><surname>Corse</surname></persName> forward to drive them in, which he did handsomely, and <persName n="Clingman,,,,," id="n0122.0002.00002.00021" reg="mostcommon:Clingman,nomatch:0"><surname>Clingman</surname></persName>, with his <num value="2">two</num> regiments, following <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n0122.0002.00002.00022" reg="nearbymention:Hoke,R.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>After effecting the crossing the enemy were hotly pursued, but having no cavalry, and the men much worn by the long night's march, and not having been allowed fires, we were unable to press our advantage as we would have done had there been fresh troops on hand; in fact it was <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> before <persName n="Corse,General,,,," id="n0122.0002.00002.00023" reg="mostcommon:Corse,M.,D.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Corse</surname></persName> could come to the crossing of the <placeName key="tgn,1127725" n="1.000 47" reg="neuse, north carolina, united states">Neuse</placeName> road with the railroad, some <num value="2">two</num>-and-a-half miles from the town; there was unfortunately no co-operation, the other parties having failed to attack, and I found we were making the fight single-handed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Thus the earliest possible moment at which he could have joined me, would have been on the evening of the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d instant</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I could not thus have attacked before the <dateStruct value="--4"><day reg="4">4th instant</day></dateStruct>. <persName n="Barton,General,,,," id="n0122.0002.00003.00035" reg="nearbymention:Barton,J.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Barton</surname></persName> afterwards informed me, verbally, that he could, positively, have done nothing on his side of the river.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I could, however, hear nothing from him for some time, and when I did, it was the unsatisfactory note I have alluded to.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>On the night of the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">1st instant</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Wood,Commander,,,," id="n0122.0002.00003.00037" reg="mostcommon:Wood,John,Taylor,,:3"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> gallantly attacked and took the <num value="6">six</num>-gun steamer <quote><persName n="Underwriter,,,,," id="n0122.0002.00003.00038" reg="mostcommon:Underwriter,nomatch:0"><surname>Underwriter</surname></persName>,</quote> but was compelled to burn her, thus losing us her invaluable services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The enemy having had ample time to reinforce, both by water and railroad, the trains running in constantly, night and day, from <placeName reg="Morehead City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075757">Morehead City</placeName>, and in fact, the whole plan by which the place was to be reduced having failed, I deemed it prudent, after consulting with my officers, to withdraw, which we did at our leisure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The result may be summed up as follows, viz.: <hi rend="italics">Killed</hi> and <hi rend="italics">wounded</hi>, about <num value="100">one hundred</num>; <measure n="13" type="captured">captured thirteen</measure> officers, <num value="284">two hundred and eighty-four</num> privates, <num value="14">fourteen</num> negroes, <num value="2">two</num> rifle pieces and caissons, <num value="300">three hundred</num> stand of small arms, <num value="4">four</num> ambulances, <num value="3">three</num> wagons, <num value="103">one hundred and three</num> animals, a quantity of clothing and garrison equipage, and <num value="2">two</num> flags.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Our loss about <measure n="45" type="killed and wounded">forty-five killed and wounded</measure>. A correct list will be forwarded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I found the ground in my front swept by half a dozen forts, <num value="1">one</num> of them mounting <num value="7">seven</num> rifle guns, with which they fired at pleasure over and into our line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Had I have had the whole force in hand, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/>I have little doubt that we could have gone in easily, taking the place by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I would not advise a movement against <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName> or <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> again until the iron-clads are done.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In the meantime, having received dispatches that the enemy were in force at <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>, and advancing on <placeName reg="Blackwater Creek, Virginia Beach, Virginia" key="tgn,2178820">Blackwater</placeName>, I deemed it prudent to send <persName n="Clingman,General,,,," id="n0122.0002.00004.00041" reg="mostcommon:Clingman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Clingman</surname></persName> back to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</p>

Had he done so, the enemy being fully employed by me, he would probably have carried out this part of the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>At any rate it was worth the trial, and I respectfully ask an investigation of his want of cooperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>From all that I can learn, no infantry were over on that side of the river.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The present operation I was afraid of from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as there were too many contingencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>I should have wished more concentration, but still hope the effect produced by the expedition may prove beneficial.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>These reinforcements were pushed rapidly forward, and, as I anticipated, reached the field at the moment when the line was most heavily pressed, and at a time when their presence gave confidence to our men, and discouragement to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>I had scarcely put my command in double quick, when the report of artillery in my front indicated that the fight had opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Quickening our pace we moved on until within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the place where the road we were upon crossed the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>About this time the engagement became general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>In a few moments I was informed by <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Colquitt,General,,,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00260" reg="nearbymention:Colquitt,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Colquitt</surname></persName>'s staff that I was in proper position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Being now at long range (<measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure>) I advanced in conjunction with the right of the line to about <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of the enemy, who stubbornly stood their ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In about this position the field was hotly contested by both parties for about <num value="1">one</num> hour, when the enemy gave slowly away before the close pressure of our gallant men. (It was during this, while riding with my staff down the line from the left toward the center, that my ordnance officer, <persName n="Dancy,,R.,T.,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00261" reg="default:Dancy,R.,T.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Dancy</surname></persName>, was instantly killed, and my aid-de-camp, <persName n="Clark,Lieutenant,Horace,B.,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00262" reg="default:Clark,Horace,B.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>Horace</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, and <num value="1">one</num> of my couriers had their horses shot under them).</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But soon a new line of the enemy appeared, and our advance was checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>His resistance now seemed more stubborn than before, for more than <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, when the enemy suddenly gave back, apparently to seek a better position, but still held us at bay.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Now the result of the day seemed doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It was whispered down the lines (particularly in the <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num> and <num value="30">Thirty</num>second <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> regiments) that our ammunition was failing, and no ordnance train in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>This I immediately reported to <persName n="Colquitt,General,,,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00263" reg="nearbymention:Colquitt,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Colquitt</surname></persName>, who urged that we hold our ground, stating that our ammunition would certainly reach us directly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>This, I am proud to say, was heroically complied with by my command, many of them for <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> standing their ground without a round of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Seeing the critical state of affairs, I dismounted myself, placed <num value="1">one</num> of my staff, whose horse had been disabled, upon mine, who, together with the remainder of my staff and couriers was employed in conveying ammunition from a train of cars, some half mile or more distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It was in the discharge of this duty that <persName n="Blount,Lieutenant,George,M.,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00264" reg="default:Blount,George,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Blount</surname></persName>, my acting assistant adjutantgeneral, was shot from his horse, but not seriously wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>By several trips, they succeded in supplying sufficient ammunition to our line, to enable a reopening of a rapid and effective fire, before which the enemy had commenced to retire slowly, still keeping up their fire upon us, when the <orgName type="regiment" key="1FLBattalion">First Florida battalion</orgName>, under command of <persName n="Hopkins,Lieutenant-Colonel,C.,F.,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00265" reg="default:Hopkins,C.,F.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Hopkins</surname></persName> and a section of <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Guerard,,,,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00266" reg="nearbymention:Guerard,Jonathan,M.,,"><surname>Guerard</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> under <persName n="Geguillist,Lieutenant,W.,Robert,," id="n0122.0003.00024.00267" reg="default:Geguillist,W.,Robert,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Geguillist</surname></persName> arrived from the entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>These reinforcements, with some that arrived upon the right, served to embolden our men and intimidate the enemy, for their retreat now became more hurried, and their fire less rapid and effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="--20"><day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct>, it being reported that the enemy were advancing in the direction of <persName n="Sanderson,,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00309" reg="mostcommon:Sanderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Sanderson</surname></persName>, I received orders from the <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs> commanding to advance and meet them, for the purpose of ascertaining their position and number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>I accordingly moved up with all the cavalry force then available, which consisted of <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> (<num value="250">250</num>) men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="4GACav">Fourth Georgia cavalry</orgName>, <persName n="Clinch,Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00310" reg="nearbymention:Clinch,Duncan,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Clinch</surname></persName> commanding, and of <num value="202">two hundred and two</num> (<num value="202">202</num>) men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2FLCav">Second Florida cavalry</orgName>, <persName n="McCormick,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00311" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName> commanding.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>This they did in good order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The enemy then moved forward with his whole force, skirmishing on our rear, which we resisted with our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, keeping him in check, while the cavalry retired in line and in perfect order.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The skirmishing was kept up until we reached the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> crossing of the railroad from <placeName key="tgn,7017483" n="1.000 111" reg="olustee, union, florida">Olustee</placeName>, there I found our infantry and artillery under the command of <persName n="Colquitt,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00313" reg="nearbymention:Colquitt,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Colquitt</surname></persName>, from whom I received orders to dispose the cavalry on the right and left wings of our army, to prevent any flank movements of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>I accordingly ordered <persName n="Clinch,Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00314" reg="nearbymention:Clinch,Duncan,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Clinch</surname></persName> to occupy the left with his regiment, and <persName n="McCormick,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00315" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName> with the <orgName type="regiment" key="2FLCav">Second Florida cavalry</orgName> to take position on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Early in the action <persName n="Clinch,Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00316" reg="nearbymention:Clinch,Duncan,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Clinch</surname></persName> received a severe wound in the leg, which made it necessary for him to retire from the field, and the command of his regiment then devolved upon <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00317" reg="nearbymention:Brown,R.,A.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, who kept an efficient guard on the left flank, while <persName n="McCormick,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00027.00318" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName> protected the right.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>On <num value="2">two</num> occasions I discovered that the enemy was attempting to cross the railroad on the right of our infantry, evidently for the purpose <pb id="p.28" n="28"/>of turning that wing, when I directed <persName n="McCormick,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00319" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName> to dismount a portion of his regiment and drive them back, which he did effectually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Thus by the vigilance of the cavalry on the right and left, the enemy was prevented from deploying his large force so as to turn either flank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="5FLBattalionCav">Fifth Florida battalion cavalry</orgName>, <persName n="Scott,Major,G.,W.,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00320" reg="default:Scott,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> commanding, was not brought upon the field until late in the evening, in consequence of the jaded condition of the men and horses from hard service for the <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> preceding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>He, .however, joined with <persName n="McCormick,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00321" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName> on the right, about the middle of the contest, and rendered him prompt assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The fight terminating right, and our infantry lines not being perceptible to me through the woods, and the face of the country being cut up by snaps, making it very favorable for ambushing under the cover of night, I deemed it inadvisable to press forward with the whole cavalry force until further information could be had of the position of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>In addition to this, after the order forward was being executed, another order was received to the effect that we were getting under the fire of our men, and also that I should beware of an ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>I attached the more importance to this order, because it had already been discovered that a large body of the enemy's cavalry were resting on the opposite side of the swamp from us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The cavalry however, as soon as possible, followed up the enemy, and gathered a number of prisoners, amounting to about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>In addition to this, several prisoners were taken by <persName n="McCormick,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00322" reg="mostcommon:McCormick,Thomas,,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>McCormick</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scott,Major,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00323" reg="nearbymention:Scott,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, while protecting the right flank.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>I have to report that <persName n="Clinch,Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00324" reg="nearbymention:Clinch,Duncan,L.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Clinch</surname></persName>, and <num value="3">three</num> men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="4GACav">Fourth Georgia cavalry</orgName>, were wounded--<num value="1">one</num> of the wounded men missing, and reported now to be dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It is due to the companies of <persName n="Stephens,Captain,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00325" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,A.,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> and <persName n="Maxwell,Captain,,,," id="n0122.0003.00028.00326" reg="mostcommon:Maxwell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Maxwell</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2FLCav">Second Florida cavalry</orgName>, to state that the conduct of the men and officers, while acting as the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> of the cavalry, as we were falling back before the enemy, was highly satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They behaved with the coolness and deliberation of veterans.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>My reasons I will concisely state, and leave you to judge whether they are or not founded upon just premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>It was not known to me whether he had made the appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>In case I had waited upon him, and the office of governor of New Orleans not filled, it would have been perhaps construed as the call of a courtier; and of all characters on earth my feelings despise a man capable of cringing to power for a benefit or office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>And such characters as are capable of bending for the sake of an office are badly calculated for a representative system, where merit alone should lead to preferment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>These being my sensations and believing that a call upon him under present existing circumstances might be construed as the act of a courtier, I traveled on, engaging my own feelings; and let me declare to you that before I would violate my own ideas of propriety, I would yield up any office in the government, were I in possession of the most honorable and lucrative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>I never had any sanguine expectations of filling the office; if I should, it will be more than I expect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>But permit me here again to repeat that the friendly attention of my friends, and those particularly that I am confident acted from motives of pure friendship to me (among whom I rank you), never shall be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Gratitude is always the concomitant of a bosom susceptible of true friendship, and if I know myself my countenance never says to a man that I am his friend but my heart beats in unison with it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1006"/>Nevertheless, when we reached the right of the enemy's fortifications the men were almost completely exhausted and not in a condition to make an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1007"/>Skirmishers were thrown out and moved up to the vicinity of the fortifications.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>These we found to be very strong and constructed very scientifically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>They consist of a circle of enclosed forts, connected by breastworks with ditches, palisades, and abattis in front, and every approach swept by a cross-fire of artillery, including some heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>I, therefore, reluctantly determined to retire, and as it was evident preparations were making to cut off my retreat, and while troops were gathering around me, I would find it difficult to get supplies, I determined to retire across the <rs>Potomac</rs> to this county before it became too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>I was led to this determination by the conviction that the loss of my force would have had such a depressing effect upon the country and would so encourage the enemy as to amount to a very serious, if not fatal disaster to our cause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1152"/>The <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> had lately made some grants to favorites for immense tracts of land in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1153"/>As to the treaty, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were to pay to their citizens <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of dollars for <persName><foreName>Spanish</foreName></persName> spoilations out of the proceeds of the sales of land in that province; it was insisted on their part that those grants should be annulled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1156"/>He was bearer of <num value="2">two</num> letters certifying this declaration to be consistent with the intention of the negotiators, <num value="1">one</num> signed by <persName n="Onis,Mister,,,," id="n0122.0020.00086.01019" reg="mostcommon:Onis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Onis</surname></persName>, the other by <persName n="Neuville,Mister,Hyde,,,de" id="n0122.0020.00086.01020" reg="expanded:Neuville,Hyde,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Hyde</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Neuville</surname></persName>, who, by order of his government, had acted in the negotiation as a common friend, and in the character of an inofficial mediator.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1158"/>That government is also well apprised of the determination of ours not to give the explanation they require on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1165"/>We paid for the soil of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> much more than it was worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1691"/>Out of ammunition, the men supplied themselves from the boxes of the dead and wounded, and held this position until dark, when they fell back and reformed on the right of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 33">Thirty-third regiment</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/>We have all the time been straitened and embarrassed for lack of the means of properly prosecuting our work, and have constantly seen how we could enlarge our usefulness if we only had the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/>Our success thus far has been beyond the most sanguine expectations of our friends, and while many similar enterprises have failed, we have lived, and expect to live, even without an endowment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>We see frequent notices of large donations to colleges, charitable institutions, &amp;c., and always rejoice when men or women are wise enough to make such judicious use of their money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>But we really do not know of a better investment that <num value="1">one</num> of our rich men could make than to endow this Society, which, in the years to come, will hand down to posterity the true history of our Southern land &mdash; the true story of the deeds of her sons in Colonial, Revolutionary, and Confederate times.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/>And if some rich man wishes to build for himself a monument <quote>more lasting than brass,</quote> we do not know how he can better do it than by linking his name with this Society, and having it handed down as the patron of this effort to vindicate the name and fame of our people, and preserve for the future historian the material for their history.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2763"/>I felt that our cause was then the <rs>Lost Cause</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2764"/>Many of the scenes witnessed by me as I went to and fro through the streets of that good old city were heartrending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2765"/>The bad news had spread with lightning speed all over town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2767"/>The men, generally, were on the street, and large numbers of the ladies stood in the doors and on the steps of their houses, many bathed in tears, making inquiries and giving utterance to woeful disappointment and anguish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2769"/>The scene, as a whole, was <num value="1">one</num> of bitterest sadness, such as I trust never again to behold; such as, I am sure, I shall never again witness, since such scenes rarely occur in the lifetime of any people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2771"/>About nightfall I took my seat in a car of the train at the <rs type="place">Danville depot</rs> preparing to start southward with its sad and disappointed human freight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2774"/>My fellow-passengers, both male and female, in the crowded car were very much in the same plight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2775"/>I never knew so little conversation indulged by so large a number of acquaintances together, for we were nearly all acquainted with each other, and, I may say, fellow fugitives driven by the same great calamity and wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2971"/>It may contain reflections and speculations which will seem novel, curious, and perhaps absurd, to the reader of to-day, especially in the light of subsequent events; and doubtless there are many crudities which <num value="1">one</num>, ambitions for the reputation of a fine writer, would not willingly submit to public criticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2972"/>But it may be that those very reflections which appear the least reasonable to the reader who was not familiar, from personal experience, with the tone of thought and feeling, the hopes and fears and aspirations of the soldiers and citizens of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, will serve, in some measure, to give the truest pictures of the <rs>South</rs> under the old regime, and were I to undertake to re-write the narrative, the temptation might prove too strong, I fear, to fashion some of its features more in accordance with results, or to sacrifice historical accuracy to the prevailing sentiments of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2975"/>I have not learned that the <rs>South</rs> could have refused, with manliness, to accept the war which was forced upon her, or that she did anything, in its inception, in its conduct, or after its conclusion, which could tarnish the escutcheon of a brave, noble, and enlightened people.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3387"/>Shortly, however, the booming of cannon on our left, and the screaming of shells over our heads, announced that victory was yet to be won.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3797"/>But the contents of the book itself would have been welcomed even if coming in rough garb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3798"/>As a story of a great revolution, told by its leading actor, it would command attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3799"/>When this actor is a man of great ability, of unspotted character; a high-toned <name>Christian</name> gentleman; as true a patriot as ever drew sword in freedom's cause, and the master of a terse, classic English which has long been the admiration of scholars and the delight of those who have heard him or read his State papers, it were superfluous to add that we <hi rend="italics">expected</hi> a book of rare power and deep interest, and that we have not been disappointed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3801"/>We have neither time nor space now for any elaborate review of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3802"/>We propose in future to give a series of papers on its several parts, with liberal extracts from its pages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3803"/>We can only give now some idea of its scope and the value of its contents.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3804"/>Part I is a very able sketch of the origin of slavery in this country and the process by which our friends at the <rs>North</rs>, who were mainly instrumental in establishing it, discovered that it was <quote>the sum of all villianies</quote> <hi rend="italics">after</hi> they had sold their slaves and pocketed the money, and begun that sectional agitation which culminated in the election of a sectional <rs type="role2">President</rs> and the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3805"/>He ably shows that slavery was not the cause, but an incident of the separation, and that for the secession movement the <rs>North</rs>, and not the <rs>South</rs>, was responsible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3806"/>Part <num value="2">II</num> is a forcible, clear and unanswerable constitutional argument for the <name>Sovereignty</name> of the <name>States</name>, and the <name>Right</name> of Secession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3807"/>Part <num value="3">III</num> gives a deeply interesting narrative of <quote>Secession and Confederation,</quote> showing the steps by which the <rs>Southern States</rs> seceded, the formation of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the provisions of the <rs>Confederate Constitution</rs>, &amp;c. He clearly sets forth that the <rs>Confederates</rs> were for peace, not war &mdash; that they exhausted every means of pacification, while their commissioners at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> awaited the pleasure of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and were amused by the perfidious assurances of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n0122.0079.00286.03419" reg="mostcommon:Seward,W.,H.,,:1"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> would be evacuated at the very time when the <rs>Government</rs> was fitting out an expedition to reinforce it &mdash; and that the cry against the <rs>South</rs> for <quote>firing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun</quote> is as senseless and false as to charge a man with being the aggressor who disarms the assassin advancing on him with drawn weapon instead of waiting for him to strike.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3808"/>Part <num value="4">IV</num> embraces the history of the war and of the civil administration during the <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of the great struggle for constitutional freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3809"/>He shows the difficulties with which the <rs>South</rs> had to contend, brings out clearly the fact that from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> we fought against overwhelming numbers and resources, shows the ability of our generals, the heroism of our soldiers, the patriotism of our people, and the devotion of our noble women; and writes a story of which we may well be proud, and which we may, without a blush, hand down to generations yet unborn.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3810"/>He does not go into full details of battles, but gives rather general outlines and results; but on all of our great campaigns he sheds light, which his position enabled him to give, and adds interesting personal anecdotes and incidents to our previous stock of information, which makes us regret that he did not make another volume, and treat this part of his narrative more fully.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3811"/>He brings out very clearly that in the general <quote>conduct of the war,</quote> so far as observing the <quote>humanities</quote> of modern civilization, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has a far better record than the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and that (despite of widely circulated <pb id="p.287" n="287"/>slanders to the contrary) in the matter of the exchange and treatment of prisoners, conduct of our troops in the enemy's country, &amp;c., our record is <num value="1">one</num> which might well elicit the tribute of the <rs>English</rs> poet: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3812"/></p><l>No nation rose so pure and fair</l> <l>Or fell so free of crime.</l></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3813"/>The impression made by the book on intelligent and fair-minded men on the other side may be gathered from the following extract from a review in the <orgName n="New York Sun" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi></orgName>: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p><persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0122.0079.00287.03420" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> frankly and emphatically acknowledges the <rs>Union</rs> of these States to be indissoluble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3815"/>He admits that secession has been demonstrated once for all to be impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3816"/>For good or for evil, the lot of the <rs>South</rs> is inextricably coupled with that of the <rs>North</rs>; and whatever perils shall hereafter menace the people of the whole country in their political and civil liberties, will be those engendered not of disintegration but of consolidation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3817"/>For these very reasons many generous and upright men of all parties will concur with <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0122.0079.00287.03421" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> in thinking the time has come to weigh dispassionately the character of the motives and the soundness of the arguments which led the <rs>Southern States</rs> to form an independent federation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3818"/>If it be true that the <rs>Union</rs> is henceforth indestructible, it has clearly become our paramount duty to see to it that the common flag is what it once was, a symbol of sympathy and fraternity, and not the detested emblem of compulsory aggregation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3819"/>We must no longer permit ourselves to think or speak of the late Confederates as <quote>rebels,</quote> for the term begs the whole question, hinging on the purport of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and is really inapplicable to men who simply held and applied a conception of that instrument, which was not even disputed for many years after the formation of the <rs>Union</rs>, and to which Northern advocates of secession had recourse long before the project of separation was mooted at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3820"/>We must not forget that even after the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States had seceded and formed a new Confederacy, so careful a student of <orgName type="college" n="American college">American</orgName> constitutional history as <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0122.0079.00287.03422" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> acknowledged that the right of peaceful withdrawal seemed to lie by implication at the root of the powers and guarantees reserved to the individual Commonwealths, and that he could discern no power in the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to coerce a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3821"/>We must bear these things in mind; we must forego ugly epithets, which only serve to breed bad blood and befog the intellect; we must admit freely that, from their point of view, the <rs>Southern States</rs> had as much right to resist the attempt to force men back into the <rs>Union</rs> as the majority of the <rs>Northern</rs> people had to exercise coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3822"/>Each party, in a word, was equally <quote>loyal</quote> to that theory of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which was dominant in its locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3823"/>Without a general recognition of this truth, it is impossible for the <num value="2">two</num> sections to understand and appreciate each other's motives and actions, and such an understanding is indispensable to the reestablishment of mutual confidence, esteem and amity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3824"/>We do not envy the man who can dispose of all the equities involved in a constitutional problem with a jeer or a taunt, who has no comment but <hi rend="italics">voe victis</hi> for the devotion of a brave people to the principle of State Rights, and who still in his heart surveys the <rs>South</rs> as a conquered country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3825"/>Such a man's notion of the <rs>Union</rs> is <pb id="p.288" n="288"/>indeed a sordid and hateful thing; it has nothing in common with the benignant conception of concord and fraternity, which the fathers sought to embody in the <rs>American Constitution</rs>, and which it is the duty and the hope of patriots to restore.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3826"/>The impression has been current at the <rs>North</rs> that the secession of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States was not the outcome of a popular movement, but the result of a so-called conspiracy, in which many of the <rs>Southern Senators</rs> and Congressmen took part, and in which <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0122.0079.00288.03423" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> himself was a chief promoter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3827"/>This view can scarcely be sustained hereafter in the face of the overwhelming evidence brought forward in these volumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3828"/>As regards the part taken by himself, <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n0122.0079.00288.03424" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> proves, by the written testimony of eye-witnesses, that he was <num value="1">one</num> of the last men among those prominent in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> politics to approve the secession of his State, and that from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> he never shared the prevailing opinion that a withdrawal from the <rs>Union</rs> could be peacefully accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3829"/>Not, of course, that he doubted the abstract right of secession, but he long questioned the expediency of its exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3945"/>The excellent effects of this gentle policy were soon manifest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4360"/>The brigade was not engaged during the day, being posted to the right of the road as a support to the <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4361"/>Early on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th instant</day></dateStruct> that brigade moved nearer the town, throwing out skirmishers, and I also moved forward, and in the afternoon, farther to the right, next to the <rs type="place">Berryville turnpike</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4362"/>At dark, I was directed by the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> commanding, to move down the road towards <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName>, and after marching several miles (a guide afterwards coming up to show the way) the brigade took a circuitous left-hand road, passing by <placeName reg="Jordan Springs, Montgomery, Tennessee" key="tgn,2427470">Jordan's Springs</placeName>, and was halted just before daybreak, on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="15">15th instant</day></dateStruct>, at the small bridge where <pb id="p.331" n="331"/>the road crosses the <orgName n="Winchester and Potomac Railroad" type="railroad">Winchester and Potomac railroad</orgName>, about <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName></placeName>, and a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> from the <rs type="place">Martinsburg turnpike</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4363"/>Wagons were heard moving along the pike, and, after a few minutes halt, the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> commanding, who had gone forward to reconnoitre, gave orders to move into the woods to the right of the road between the railroad and turnpike, and, just as the head of the column was crossing the bridge, it was fired into, causing momentary confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4364"/>Notwithstanding the difficulty of crossing in the dark, fences to the right and left of the road, line of battle was soon formed along the railroad cut, the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA10">Tenth Virginia</orgName> to the right of the bridge, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName> to the left, where there was no wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4365"/>Skirmishers were thrown forward, and a brisk fire commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4366"/>The enemy advanced in line of battle, cheering and driving in our skirmishers, but were soon themselves, in turn, driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4367"/>Receiving information that an attempt was being made to turn our left flank, I threw out <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName> to protect it. <persName n="Andrews,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03896" reg="mostcommon:Andrews,H.,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Andrews</surname></persName>, commanding the artillery battalion attached to this division, had previously placed a piece of the <rs>Maryland</rs> artillery on the bridge, and the other pieces of that battery, and a section from each of the batteries of <persName n="Rains,Captain,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03897" reg="mostcommon:Rains,M.,L.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Rains</surname></persName> and <persName n="Carpenter,Captain,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03898" reg="mostcommon:Carpenter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Carpenter</surname></persName>'s, on the rising ground in rear of my left, rendering most valuable support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4368"/>A column of the enemy was now observed passing round to our left and rear, and I directed the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC3">Third North Carolina</orgName> to repel the attack, but, finding that <num value="2">two</num> regiments of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Nichols,,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03899" reg="mostcommon:Nichols,nomatch:0"><surname>Nichols</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> were coming up, that regiment was returned to its original position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4370"/>Just before this, the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> commanding, with the aforementioned regiments of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Nichols,,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03901" reg="mostcommon:Nichols,nomatch:0"><surname>Nichols</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, attacked and pursued most vigorously that portion of the enemy, who were passing to our left and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4371"/>After a while I was informed that the ammunition of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA10">Tenth Virginia</orgName> was all expended but <num value="1">one</num> round held in reserve, and that the other <num value="2">two</num> regiments of my brigade had only a few rounds left; also that the ordnance wagons were behind, and after sending repeatedly, I found it impossible to get more ammunition.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4372"/>Several attempts were made by the enemy to carry the bridge, and almost all the cannoneers of the piece placed there were killed or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4373"/>The gallant <persName n="Contee,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03902" reg="mostcommon:Contee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Contee</surname></persName> was also wounded, and I must here mention the gallant conduct of <persName n="Morgan,Lieutenant,John,A.,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03903" reg="default:Morgan,John,A.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="1NCRegiment">First North Carolina regiment</orgName>, who, with <persName n="Owens,Private,,,," id="n0122.0083.00331.03904" reg="mostcommon:Owens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Private">Private</roleName> <surname>Owens</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Maryland</rs> <pb id="p.332" n="332"/>artillery, and some occasional assistance, manned the piece most effectively, driving the enemy back from the bridge at a most critical moment, as the regiments near, from want of ammunition, were unable to render any assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4374"/>Up to this time my brigade (with assistance from the artillery) had alone sustained the attack upon the front and right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4394"/>The gunboat ran off wsthout firing a shot, and both boats being out of reach, I directed some shells to be thrown at a squadron of cavalry which having been picketing up the river while the boats were loading, and hearing our artillery, were now endeavoring to get back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4395"/>Attempting to run by within range of our guns, a few shells exploding in their midst unhorsed several and scattered the rest in all directions.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4396"/>The men who were unhorsed, were afterwards captured by some of my skirmishers (who crossed the river in a dug-out for this purpose) and proved to be negro troops.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4397"/>Being convinced that the enemy would again advance very soon, en route for <placeName reg="Yazoo City, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057820">Yazoo City</placeName>, I examined the river banks and selected <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> <pb id="p.334" n="334"/>as the most suitable place at which to fight them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4398"/>At this point the banks are high and the hills extend down to within musket range of the river, which would enable me to use small arms and artillery at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4399"/>The bed of the river is also partially obstructed opposite <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> by a sunken steamboat, to pass which would require the enemy to move very slowly and carefully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4400"/>On the <dateStruct value="-02-2"><day reg="2">2d</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> their boats again appeared; this time <num value="11">eleven</num> (<num value="11">11</num>) in number with formidable <term type="ship">gunboats</term> <rs type="ship">Nos</rs>. <num value="3">3</num>, <num value="5">5</num>, and <num value="38">38</num>, in advance.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4401"/>They were evidently anticipating resistance at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> and therefore passed the entire day in reconnoitering, but kept beyond the range of our guns, occasionally throwing shells at our scouts and skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4402"/>No effort to pass was made, nor did any boat get within reach of our artillery until the morning of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>; <num value="3">three</num> gunboats then moved up to within range.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4408"/>The enemy charged and were driven back, rallied, charged the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time and were again repulsed with <num value="6">six</num>-shooters at <num value="25">twenty-five</num> paces distant, and this time so signally and effectually that they could not be checked again until they were safe on board their boats.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4409"/>Their killed and wounded, with many arms that were thrown away in their flight, were all left in our possession and were collected after the fight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4410"/>The enemy made no further effort to dislodge us, but late in the evening about-faced and moved off down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4411"/>I did not conclude that they had given up the expedition entirely, and was not surprised when at daylight the next morning their gunboats again appeared in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4412"/>I had, however, exhausted almost all my artillery ammunition and determined to husband the remainder for an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4413"/>No resistance to the boats passing was therefore attempted, but as the transports went <pb id="p.335" n="335"/>by with troops and horses, entirely exposed, the <orgName type="regiment" key="9TXCav">Ninth Texas cavalry</orgName> lined the banks and poured into them several volleys, which must have done much execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4414"/>As soon as they were passed, I moved my command direct to <placeName reg="Yazoo City, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057820">Yazoo City</placeName>, determined to intercept them again at that place and prevent their landing or expend my last shot in the effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4415"/>Arrived at <placeName reg="Yazoo City, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057820">Yazoo City</placeName> on the evening of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4417"/>My position had already been chosen and artillery posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4418"/>The bank of the river was lined with my sharpshooters concealed by the rough and broken surface of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4419"/>When the advance boat, which proved to be the <num value="38">No. 38</num>, had arrived to within a few yards of the landing, <num value="1">one</num> of my rifle pieces opened fire at short range; almost every shot taking effect and some of them passing entirely through the boat into the water beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4420"/>The enemy promptly returned our shots, but in a few moments the <num value="38">No. 38</num> was disabled and began, with great difficulty to drop back down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4421"/>The other boats, halting beyond the range of our guns, shelled us for an hour or <num value="2">two</num>, and then drew off to their transports, <num value="4">four</num> (<num value="4">4</num>) miles below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4422"/>I now made disposition of my forces for resisting a land attack, suspecting the enemy of an intention to again send out his infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4423"/>Indeed, several regiments had already landed and deployed in line, but showed no desire to come within range of our muskets.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4424"/>Evidently intimidated by the rough handling they had received the day before, at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName>, the whole force re-embarked late in the evening, and moved off down the river, closely followed by my scouts, and reported passing Sataritia at <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> next morning.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4864"/>There is, of course, no danger that the great political and military events connected with the war between the <name>States</name> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> will be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4865"/>History will forever keep alive the memory of these, but the little details and incidents, too trivial for the historian to recount, are liable to melt away gradually in the mists of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4866"/>Yet these trifles may be not without some importance, as they may tend to throw a faint light upon different phases of the great contest, and may, for this purpose, prove worthy of perusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4867"/>It is only on this ground that I venture to record some of my recollections of that momentous period.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4868"/>I was merely a private in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, but as I was a Southerner neither by birth, blood, nor residence at the commencement of the war, my experiences may be in some respects exceptional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4869"/>If you ask, kind reader, how it happened, that under such circircumstances, I became a Confederate soldier, I answer you in this wise: I was born in a Northern State--was young and ardent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4870"/>I had the good or evil fortune, as you may choose to consider it, of being a gentleman, and had fair prospects in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4871"/>My education had been completed &mdash; I was intended for the profession of law. Through my studies and my family surroundings I had imbibed the <name>States</name>-Rights view of the great Constitutional questions then agitating the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4872"/>This was not surprising, although such an opinion was at variance with the centralizing tendencies of the then dominant party at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4873"/>States-Rights doctrines, in a more or less thorough form, were not at <pb id="p.370" n="370"/>that time uncommon in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4874"/>The relations of the <name>States</name> under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs> were more generally regarded as Federal, than National; the words <quote>Nation</quote> and <quote>National</quote> were then not of general use, for the political ideas implied in the use of these terms were not generally current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4875"/>In fact, from time to time, nearly every Northern State had shown its teeth, and growled about <quote>reserved rights,</quote> when the shoe of Federal legislation threatened to pinch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4876"/>Less than <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> before this time the <orgName n="Hartford Convention" type="convention">Hartford Convention</orgName> had declared the right and intention of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, if the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, deemed by them detrimental to their commercial interests, was not terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4877"/>The ink was not then long dry in the declaration penned by <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n0122.0088.00370.04332" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, that the <rs>Southern States</rs> had the legal right to secede, and that the <rs>Northern States</rs> had no right to resist forcibly their secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4878"/>When, at present, such ridiculously inapplicable misnomers, as <quote>disloyalty</quote> and <quote>treason,</quote> <quote>rebels</quote> and <quote>traitors</quote> are so freely applied by the popular voice to the adherents of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, it is very difficult to realize that a few years ago States-Rights views were largely entertained throughout the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4879"/>To understand this apparent contradiction it is only necessary to remember, that people are generally influenced in their opinions by what they believe at the time to be their interests, and that they now hold that their material interests are centered in the <rs>Union</rs>, whereas formerly they attached great importance to local government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4880"/><hi rend="italics">Ergo</hi>, States-Rights doctrines are now at a discount, but that does not prove that they were not correct, or that <num value="1">one</num> was wrong in entertaining them in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1865--"><year reg="1865">1865</year></dateStruct>, If, however, it be a true saying that <quote>nothing is more successful than success,</quote> it is equally true that nothing is more unsuccessful than failure.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4882"/>The war had been raging for about <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, a time of suffering and of carnage for the participants on both sides, but also a period replete with wretchedness for the Peace-party at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4883"/>Their political world had entered upon a new and violent geological period; the earthquake of war, and the volcano of revolution were daily effecting sudden, vast, and startling changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4884"/>This Peace-party was essentially conservative in its nature, and comprised many of the best and purest men, as well as of the highest, intellectually and socially, in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4885"/>These people believed that the <rs>South</rs> had a legal right to sustain their secession by force of arms against the aggression of the central Government <pb id="p.371" n="371"/>of the other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4886"/>They conscientiously believed that the <rs>South</rs> was right, and that she was fighting for constitutional liberty against most dangerous revolutionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4887"/>Such being their convictions, the members of this party necessarily could not sympathize with the successes of the northern armies, nor deplore the victories of the southern troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4888"/>From this state of affairs arose very bitter personal and political animosities between the advocates of the prosecution of the war and the opposers of it. The result was frequent violent quarrels between near relatives, and the angry disruption of many life-long and hereditary friendships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4889"/>Believing themselves right, only wishing to put a stop to bloodshed, and to preserve liberty and law for both sections, yet these people were constantly denounced by their opponents as traitors of the deepest dye, plotting with armed rebels for their country's ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4890"/>As they had been after the commencement of the war in a minority, they were debarred politically from preferment, and their exertions in private pursuits were much handicapped by the ostracism of the greater number of their neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4891"/>Meantime battle succeeded to battle, usurpation to usurpation, an endless, hopeless night of misery seemed to envelope the entire land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4892"/>Altogether the Peace-party had a wretched time of it; their only consolation being their conviction that they were right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4893"/>Had it been a foreign war, their hearts would have been with their countrymen &mdash; right or wrong &mdash; for <quote>blood is thicker than water;</quote> but it was a civil war; the southern armies were composed of men of the same blood as themselves, worthy descendants of the grand liberty-loving, hard-fighting, Anglo-<persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n0122.0088.00371.04333" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4894"/>How then could they glory in their sufferings?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4895"/>And yet, for not doing so, they were stigmatized by the War-party as traitors.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4896"/>To this Peace-party I belonged, enthusiastically, devotedly adherred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4897"/>I clung to the hope that forcible opposition at home might eventually compel the <name>Revolutionists</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> to stop the wild orgy of war. I longed to draw my maiden sword on the soil of my native State, to do, or die for her dear sake, striking for civil liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4898"/>Months passed by and weariness in waiting was well nigh succeeded by despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4899"/>Daily would friends meet, discuss the situation, and groan at their inability to effect any good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4900"/><num value="1">One</num> large hotel was the chief rendezvous for meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4901"/>Here at any hour of the day you could find acquaintances who would tell you the latest current news, and also in mysterious whispers impart the gossip from <placeName reg="Fort Dixie">Dixie</placeName>, the hopes and fears, the joys and sorrows, or stories of mutual acquaintances, who were there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4902"/>At length the time came when the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName> found the volunteer system (though supplemented by enormous bounty-giving) <pb id="p.372" n="372"/>no longer adequate to supply fresh food for gunpowder to her depleted legions, and she was compelled to resort to stringent conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4903"/>This was believed by very many to be illegal and unconstitutional, and a disposition to forcibly resist the conscription was evinced in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4904"/>Then, indeed, seemed to have dawned at last the day for action, and gladly was it welcomed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4905"/>The people turned out in the streets in large numbers, overpowered guards, destroyed and burned conscription bureaus, threw up barricades, and hemmed in the police within their station-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4906"/>Very soon, however, this movement degenerated into a mere riot; the mob took possession of the city; professional thieves thronged from neighboring cities for purposes of plunder; property and life were unprotected; anarchy reigned for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4907"/>Finally order was restored by the military, after some loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4908"/>I soon saw that no good could come out of this movement and of course had no part in the misdeeds of the rioters; my mortification and disgust were only equaled by my disappointment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4909"/>The consequence of the enforcement of the conscription was, that I had to take my chances of being drafted into the <rs>Northern</rs> army, or of buying a substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4910"/>The latter I was pecuniarily able to do, but there was, in my opinion, no difference morally in fighting in <num value="1">one</num>'s own person for an unjust and detested cause, or in sending a hireling to fight for you; no more difference morally than there would be between hiring an assassin to commit a murder for you and doing the deed yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4911"/>At all events, that was the view which I took of it, and I determined neither to fight against my principles in person or by proxy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4912"/>Hitherto I had been permitted by the government, at <placeName reg="Washington, Wilkes, Georgia" key="tgn,2024666">Washington</placeName>, to remain neutral in action, and so long as such was the case, it might be my duty to remain at home, as thus I might, by some possibility, be able to be of use to my own State and my own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4913"/>But now the alternative was presented to me of either fighting for or against the principles which I held sacred; I choose the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4914"/>In making this decision, I believed I was right, and have never since seen reason to doubt it. I determined to leave at once for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, turning my back on ambition as well as upon home, as the family influence, which might have pushed me along, was, of course, confined to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4915"/>I was to go by <name>British</name> steamer from New York to <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0124	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, running the blockade from there into <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4916"/>To get across the military land-lines to the <rs>South</rs> at that time was an equally uncertain undertaking, and moreover, I wished to carry with me a good out-fit for the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4917"/>I had not been long in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> before I became aware that the bringing of an out-fit was not necessary, as <num value="1">one</num> could procure <pb id="p.373" n="373"/>easily very good ones there, and at not very high prices either, if calculated in gold, though overwhelmingly high, if estimated in paper currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4918"/>Naturally, the little circle of my friends knew of my proposed journey, and much was the sympathy which I experienced from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4919"/>During my last evening before starting, so many of my friends dropped in to say good-bye and <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-speed, that I had quite a little levee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4920"/>Nearly every <num value="1">one</num> presented me with some little gift supposed to be suitable for the out-fit of a cavalryman, which I intended to be, so that my trunk became quite a respectable sized arsenal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4921"/><num value="1">One</num> had given me a sabre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4922"/>It was so ponderous and formidable in appearance that we christened it in joke <quote>Durandal,</quote> after the far-famed brand of the redoubtable <rs>Taladin Roland</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4923"/>The only mode of concealment, when going aboard ship, which I could think of for this unwieldly instrument of destruction, was to tie it up with an umbrella in a roll of army blankets, which was supposed to look to the uninitiated like an ordinary traveling-rug with umbrellas thrust into it innocently; but in point of fact, it did not look a bit so. Why the detectives, of whom there were several unmistakably peering around inquisitively on the wharf, did not bag me, I do not comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4924"/>I had been a Confederate soldier but a short time before I discovered that this much beloved <quote>Durandal,</quote> the bringing of which with me from New York, had given me a world of trouble, was rather an <quote>elephant</quote> on my hands, the use of cold steel having been almost superseded by <quote>villanious saltpetre,</quote> and that a sword could at any time be had for the asking.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4925"/>Soon, however, in spite of my suspicious-looking luggage, I found myself aboard the good steamer <quote><placeName key="tgn,7001093" n="1.000 3" reg="corsica">Corsica</placeName>,</quote> safe from molestation, under the flag of Old England.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4926"/>After leaving I hobnobbed a good deal with an Englishman, an exofficer in the <name>Horse</name>-Guards, who had given up his commission for a time to enter the service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, whither he was now bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4927"/>A nice, plucky fellow he was, of gigantic, athletic build.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4928"/>He served the war out like a man, as I afterwards heard, and then returned to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, having gained no distinction for his trouble, but perfectly satisfied with his adventures nevertheless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4929"/>I was told that he never complained of the hardships and privations of campaigning, but only grumbled at the difficulty of procuring mounts suitable to his unusual weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4930"/>My other fellow-travellers were bent on pleasure, or business; among them were no other recruits for the <rs>Southern</rs> army, so far as I knew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4931"/>After a short and pleasant voyage we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.082 000000.1636	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.006 000000.0124	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4933"/>We found the place teeming with business and speculative excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4934"/>Previous to and after the war it was an insignificant little town, situated on an unproductive island of very limited extent, but during the times of which I am speaking it was the point of arrival and departure for the blockade runners plying constantly between there and <placeName reg="Wilmington River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2775185">Wilmington</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and occasionally other southern ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4938"/>The speculators never lost sight of the cardinal principle of their occupation, to buy cheap and to sell dear, so that a few successful ventures often made them a fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4943"/>I had been provided with a letter of introduction, and credit by a New York house on the principal firm in the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4944"/>These I presented and requested assistance in procuring a passage by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blockade-runner for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4945"/>This they arranged for me by a steamer to leave <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4946"/>I was informed that the usual fare charged for the trip was <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> in gold, but the price was fixed for me at <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> in gold, because I was going as a recruit to the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4947"/>As the premium <pb id="p.375" n="375"/>on gold in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at that time was <num value="15">fifteen</num> to <num value="18">eighteen</num> for <num value="1">one</num>, this sum amounted to <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> to <measure n="1800dollars" type="currency">$1,800</measure>, and being a <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi> export duty on food for gunpowder, struck me as an excessive charge to be made by such kindly disposed, unselfish people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4949"/>We afterwards learnt that our captain was greatly disgusted at the small amount of fare received from us, as the larger portion of the passage money, it seems, was his perquisite.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4950"/>In due course we embarked on our steamer for the short voyage to <placeName reg="Wilmington River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2775185">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4951"/>A trial trip of about an hour's duration was made round the delicately blue transparent waters of the harbor; caution being observed of course to keep well within the marine league from shore &mdash; the limit of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s juridiction &mdash; in the meantime the passengers and some invited friends of the captain or agents were being regaled with ale and champagne, of very inferior quality, in which was drunk success to the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4952"/>This was done to test machinery and to make sure that everything was in perfect order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4953"/>This was a very sensible precaution, for the <rs>Federal</rs> cruisers might be met at any moment lurking in the offing, and then it was a race to escape &mdash; the blockade runners being merchantmen entirely without armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4954"/>Our vessel was painted of a bluish-white color to make her less likely to be seen at sea, especially at night, but other than this I could perceive no attempt at concealment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4955"/>Our trial trip ended, we put to sea in a very matter offact manner &mdash; no hostile cruisers being visible &mdash; so we were disappointed of the excitement of a chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4956"/>Indeed, during the entire voyage only <num value="1">one</num> vessel was sighted at sea; she was quite distant, and we did not have the impoliteness to approach any nearer to ask inquisitively about her nationality.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4957"/>It was intended to reach Wilmington Bar somewhat after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, when the moon would be up. This surprised me, as I thought a dark night would have been preferred for making the attempt to run past the <rs>Blockading Fleet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4958"/>It seems, however, that it was considered the lesser of <num value="2">two</num> evils to run the risk of being seen and chased, rather than to take the certain danger of being wrecked, when running in with insufficient light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4959"/>After a favorable voyage we reached the desired point off <placeName reg="Wilmington River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2775185">Wilmington</placeName> at the proper time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4960"/>A brief stoppage was made, when soon the final preparations were completed for running the gauntlet of the <rs>Federal Blockaders</rs>, who would become visible shortly, as we approached nearer shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4961"/>All the lights in the steamer were extinguished, <pb id="p.376" n="376"/>and all passengers were ordered below, only officers and crew being permitted on deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4962"/>The furnaces were replenished with carefully selected coal, which would give the greatest amount of heat, and make the least possible smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4963"/>The last orders were given; every man was at his appointed place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4964"/>Presently the boilers hissed, and the paddlewheels began to revolve faster and faster, as the fleet little steamer rose higher and higher in the water from the immense force of the rapid strokes; she actually felt like a horse gathering himself up under you for a great leap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4965"/>After a little while the few faint sounds from the deck, which we could hitherto faintly catch in the cabin, ceased altogether, and there was the stillness of death, except for the sounds necessarily made by the movements of the machinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4966"/>Then we realized that we were running for our lives past the line of cruisers, and that at any moment a big shell might come crashing through our cabin, disagreeably lighting up the darkness in which we were sitting.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4967"/>Our suspense was prolonged for some minutes longer, when speed was slackened, and finally we stopped altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4968"/>Even then we did not know whether we were safely through the lines, or whether we had been brought &mdash; to under the guns of a hostile ship, for we could distinguish nothing whatever through the port-holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4969"/>However, we were soon released from the cabin, and walked out on deck to find ourselves safely through the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4970"/>In the offing could be descried several of the now harmless blockaders, and near at hand lay the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4971"/>Soon the gray of dawn was succeeded by a brilliant, lovely sunrise, which lighted up cheerfully the low-lying shores and earthworks bristling with artillery, whilst from a fort near by floated the <rs>Southern Cross</rs>, the symbol of the glorious cause for which we had come to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4972"/>Then we felt, with a thrill of joy, that we were at length within the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and would soon be launched amid stirring adventures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4973"/>I say <hi rend="italics">we</hi>, but of the passengers the only <num value="1">one</num> besides myself to whom the term was applicable was the quondam Horse-Guardsman, for the rest were business people, seeking no <quote>adventures</quote> except in a commercial sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4975"/>The military element was here predominant, and the surroundings partook of the dignity of actual war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4977"/>Cold must have been the heart of that man, and dead must he have been to every exalted sentiment, who could gaze for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time on the veteran columns, the dear grey-jacketed ranks, of the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, without feeling his soul expand with enthusiasm.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4978"/>We were anxious to get to the front, so after waiting a few hours for a train at <placeName reg="Wilmington River, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,2775185">Wilmington</placeName>, my <name>English</name> acquaintance and I had to part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4980"/>I journeyed into the interior to consult an old family friend as to the best place at which <quote>to pitch into the fight.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4981"/>Arrived at his house, I met the warmest of welcomes only tempered by kindly anxiety on my account, and grave regrets for the excellent prospect of my being speedily knocked on the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4982"/>On my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reaching his residence, my friend was not at home, but came in a few minutes afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4983"/>He had been drilling in a company formed for State defence, intended for local purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4985"/>Shortly after my arrival dinner was announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4988"/>For my appetite, unhappily usually <num value="1">one</num> of the best I have ever met with, was then stimulated to great hunger by long fasting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4989"/>But with the joyful thought of dinner flashed across my mind, the accounts, which we were constantly reading in the <rs>Northern</rs> newspapers of the great scarcity of food in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4990"/>According to these, not only were the armies in the field destitute almost always of rations, but throughout the country, even in rural districts, far remote from military posts, the people everywhere were starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4991"/>To a great extent, I credited these statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4992"/>I therefore thought it would be brutally inconsiderate in me to allow myself to consume more than a very moderate portion from my friend's larder; I felt that that even was almost unfair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4993"/>I determined to do my plain duty by comparative abstinence, but I could not cease regretting the sacrifice even in the charming society of the ladies of the household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4994"/>Of all feasts, the <name>Barmecide</name> style was the only kind I did not fancy: however, I comforted myself as far as possible by reflecting that it was well for me to have a good deal of practice in fasting to prepare myself for the field.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4995"/>We sat down to table to a meal rather moderate in quantity, and I <pb id="p.378" n="378"/>refrained with Spartan fortitude from indulging my desire to eat ravenously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4996"/>Presently, however, other courses followed, and I found that a. plentiful supply of good plain food was around me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4997"/>After this dinner I was not slow in discovering that the newspapers had, as usual, grossly exaggerated and falsified in their accounts of the food-scarcity at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4998"/>Among forces in the field, among persons living in districts, which had been overrun by the armies, and among refugees from homes occupied by the enemy, there were frequently distressing privations, but elsewhere throughout the country there was not, as a rule, an insufficient supply of plain food, say of the homely but sustaining <quote>hog and hominy.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5071"/>Already its collection contains well-nigh everything necessary to a true history of the late war, and much that pertains to the <name>Colonial</name>, Revolutionary, and Civil history of the country, and especially of the <rs>South</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5072"/>But the <orgName n="Executive Committee" type="committee">Executive Committee</orgName> are exceedingly anxious to continue their work on an enlarged scale, and to prosecute yet more vigorously the great objects of the <name>Society</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5073"/>Without the means of purchasing a book, or paying for a manuscript, the <pb id="p.383" n="383"/>Society has obtained by the voluntary contributions of its friends, a collection which has a very large pecuniary value, but which is beyond price in <hi rend="italics">real historic value</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5074"/>The time has come, however, when we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have a larger income to meet the necessary expense of carrying on our work, and the committee have ordered a special effort to be made to raise by the <dateStruct value="-11-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> at least <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">$2,000</measure>, to meet a pressing need, and also a fund for <hi rend="italics">permanent endowment</hi>, which shall be safely invested and only the interest used for the annual wants of the <name>Society</name>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5646"/>But in spite of this, the conviction had become established in the minds of a large majority of our best officers and men that the army, in its extremely reduced state, could not be extricated from its perilous condition, surrounded by the immense force of the enemy, and without subsistence for men or animals, unless with frightful bloodshed, and to scarcely any purpose: as its remnant, if thus rescued, must be too much enfeebled for efficient service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5658"/>The column reached the <rs type="place">Courthouse</rs> about light and took position on a ridge a little beyond the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5659"/>The infantry, barely <num value="2000">two thousand</num> strong, was deployed to the right of the road, while I directed about <num value="30">thirty</num> pieces of artillery, consisting of part of the battalions of <persName n="Carter,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05056" reg="nearbymention:Carter,Thomas,H.,,"><surname>Carter</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pogue,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05057" reg="mostcommon:Pogue,nomatch:0"><surname>Pogue</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05058" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Duke,,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stark,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05059" reg="mostcommon:Stark,nomatch:0"><surname>Stark</surname></persName>, to support it. A considerable body of the enemy's cavalry, with a battery of artillery, was discovered holding the road, under cover of a wood, about half a mile in our front, which a spirited fire of our artillery quickly dislodged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5660"/>Our infantry then advanced, while the artillery covered it from the enemy's cavalry, which still threatened its flank and rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5661"/>Our advance was soon arrested by the appearance of heavy columns of the enemy's infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5663"/>The retrograde movement of our infantry was almost immediately followed by an attack upon <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Armistead,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05061" reg="mostcommon:Armistead,nomatch:0"><surname>Armistead</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName> of <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Starke,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05062" reg="mostcommon:Starke,P.,B.,,:4"><surname>Starke</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> from the enemy's dismounted cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5664"/>I at once ordered a section of a battery that was at hand to the support of <persName n="Armistead,,,,," id="n0122.0093.00423.05063" reg="mostcommon:Armistead,nomatch:0"><surname>Armistead</surname></persName>, who was gallantly defending himself with canister and schrapnel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5667"/>While this cannonade was in progress I received a message, through a staff officer of <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n0122.0093.00424.05067" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,John,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s, to cease firing as a flag of truce had been sent to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5668"/>I immediately sent to the different batteries this order, with directions to withdraw the artillery towards the <rs type="place">Courthouse</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5669"/>On my way to that point I observed a battery to the south of the road, on an eminence near the village, firing rapidly across a ravine at an advancing line of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5670"/>I proceeded to the battery and directed the <rs>Captain</rs> to cease firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5671"/>He seemed surprised, and ventured some remonstrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5672"/>I could only say it was necessary to change the position of the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5673"/>The order was reluctantly obeyed and the battery was slowly withdrawn to the place indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5674"/>I regret I do not recollect what battery this was.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5675"/>On the last day of our great sectional struggle the artillery moved to the contest with the same alacrity that had characterized it on more hopeful fields, and when the last blow was struck the veterans of a <num value="100">hundred</num> battles did not conceal the manly tears that flowed in sorrow for the lost cause.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5799"/>The text, however, of the last <num value="3">three</num> of the acts will destroy forever any doubt that may have heretofore lingered in the reader's mind, even if he were <persName n="Story,Judge,,,," id="n0122.0098.00435.05164" reg="mostcommon:Story,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Story</surname></persName> <hi rend="italics">redivivus;</hi> who, it is clear to my mind, (if he was sincere in his theory) could never have read and made a study of these <num value="5">five</num> acts grouped together in <num value="1">one</num> body, as it were, and separated from the many other acts that lie between them, but have no bearing on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5800"/>Had he done so, he, even if he had been only a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate lawyer, would have seen that they constituted a fatal obstacle to the validity of his theory.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5801"/>The mention of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> by name in the title of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of these acts, (viz.: that of Febuary <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>,) while <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> is not mentioned in that title, would naturally not be suggestive of anything of the slightest importance to any <num value="1">one</num> searching for information on this subject, inasmuch as he would infer from <hi rend="italics">the date</hi> of the act (over <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> after <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> had ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs>), and from the mention of that State only in the title, that the act had reference only to the entrance of that State into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5802"/>While the act does provide for extending the laws of the <rs>Union</rs> over <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, it, at the same time, makes in its text most unqualified admissions of the independent nationality of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, (reciting her name,) and of her entire independence of and political alienation from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5803"/>From the beginning of the government, in <dateStruct value="1789-04-"><month reg="04">April</month>, <year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, down to the <dateStruct value="-07-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, of that year, there was no revenue law whatever of the <name>United State</name> in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5804"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act laying <quote>duties on goods, wares and merchandizes,</quote> (being the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> act of any kind ever passed by Congress) although enacted on the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, yet, by its own terms, was not nor could it become an operative law until the <dateStruct value="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> next following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5805"/>The next revenue act, being the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> act ever passed by Congress, was enacted on the <dateStruct value="1789-07-20"><day reg="20">20th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month>, <year>1789</year>,</dateStruct> and it imposed duties not on the cargoes, but on the tonnage only of ships or vessels coming into the ports of the <num value="11">eleven</num> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; but this act, by its own terms, could not become operative law until the <dateStruct value="-08-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> next <pb id="p.436" n="436"/>following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5806"/>The above mentioned <num value="2">two</num> acts were the only revenue acts that were passed during the year <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5807"/>And now the time has arrived, I conceive, for us to enquire why did Congress postpone the operation of the act of <dateStruct value="-07-4"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct> to the <dateStruct value="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, and the act of <dateStruct value="-07-20"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="20">20th</day></dateStruct> to the <dateStruct value="-08-15"><day reg="15">15th</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5808"/>No reason for this postponement is apparent on the face of either of the acts, and, so far as I know, history assigns no cause for it. Readers of American history well know that there was very strong reason for those <num value="2">two</num> laws to have been passed <hi rend="italics">early in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct></hi>, and to have gone into operation immediately on their passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5809"/>The <num value="11">eleven</num> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of that day were as a Confederacy, utterly impecunious and in very urgent need of immediate revenues, and yet we have before us the strange spectacle of Congress idly waiting, without any visible cause, from <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct> to <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> before putting into effect any measures for raising much needed revenues.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5810"/>I have a theory, <rs type="role" reg="Mister-Secretary">Mr. Secretary</rs>, which explains, I think, this otherwise unaccountable delay of Congress, and furnishes, doubtless, the true reason for it. It is well known that the <rs>Congress</rs> of the summer of <dateStruct value="1789--"><year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct> and all their constituents were exceedingly desirous that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> should enter the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5811"/>Notwithstanding that each of these <num value="2">two</num> States had already held its own separate convention and had therein refused to ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs>, yet Congress knew that numerous and able friends of the <rs>Union</rs> were then, and had been during the prior <rs type="season">winter</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs>, diligently at work within each of the <num value="2">two</num> States, urging the early assembling of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> convention; and it was known that there was a very fair prospect of such convention being called soon.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5812"/>[<placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> did, indeed, call her <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> convention in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> of that year, and ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="2">29th</day></dateStruct> of that month.]</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5813"/>Now if the <num value="2">two</num> States could be induced to ratify the <rs>Constitution</rs> <hi rend="italics">before</hi> any legislation of Congress should be effected of a character bearing on them as countriesforeign <hi rend="italics">to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi>, the friends of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could say in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as well as in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> that there had been no disruption of the <rs>Union</rs> when Congress assembled in <dateStruct value="1789-04-"><month reg="04">April</month> <year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>, and no secession of <num value="11">eleven</num> States from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> union; and that the delay of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> in ratifying the new Constitution would be spoken of merely as the exceeding caution of those <num value="2">two</num> States, as manifested by their taking ample time to deliberate and decide on a matter of so great importance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5814"/>But time wore on, and when the <dateStruct value="-07-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> day of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> arrived, (<num value="1">one</num> day only, mind you, before the act of <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> would begin to operate,) and <pb id="p.437" n="437"/>neither of the <num value="2">two</num> States had yet called their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> convention, Congress saw that they were then compelled to take action, and the law of the <dateStruct value="-07-31"><day reg="31">31st</day> <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> was the result of that action.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5815"/>And now, mark you, how tenderly and in what a conciliatory spirit Congress treated the <num value="2">two</num> recusant sisters in that act while being under the necessity of legislating towards each of them as towards any other foreign country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5816"/>Congress well knew, in fact they virtually say so in the act, that unless something were done at once, the <rs>General Revenue Act</rs> of <dateStruct value="-07-4"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="4">4th</day></dateStruct>, would begin at once, i. e. on <dateStruct value="-08-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>, to take effect on the products and manufactures of the <num value="2">two</num> States when imported into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, for that act excepted no country that was outside of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> of that date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5830"/>This provision of the act in question shows, by <pb id="p.439" n="439"/>the way, how the revenue act of the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> was brought into operation on <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, although neither of those <num value="2">two</num> States is mentioned either in the title or in the text of that act.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5831"/>When we come, however, to analyze the <hi rend="italics">whole</hi> phrase, including the <num value="8">eight</num> words before referred to, and taken in connection with the entire section, we see at once what Congress meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5832"/>The entire phrase, including the <num value="8">eight</num> words referred to, does not describe, nor was it meant to describe the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of <hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="1789-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1789">1789</year></dateStruct>,</hi> but that geographical area on the <name>Continent</name> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> had acknowledged, in the <rs>Treaty</rs> of Peace, to be free from her jurisdiction in <dateStruct value="1782--"><year reg="1782">1782</year></dateStruct>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5833"/>Why Congress employed this peculiar and cumbersome phraseology in section <num value="39">39</num> is, I think, very apparent Out of a kind regard for the feelings of their late <num value="2">two</num> political associates they desired, even when framing revenue laws designed to tax goods coming into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from those former associates, to employ, and they deemed it politic to employ, language that would, as much as possible, disguise and soften the situation, which it was hoped would be of but short duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5834"/>In accordance with this view we find Congress using, in section <num value="38">38</num>, such mollifying phrases as <quote>for the present</quote> and <quote>as yet.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5835"/>But as time rolled on and the <num value="2">two</num> States still kept out of the <rs>Union</rs> we find Congress, in the act of <dateStruct value="-09-16"><month reg="09">September</month> <day reg="16">16th</day></dateStruct>, throwing aside this sentimentality, and speaking right out in church, when they commenced in that act to call things by their plain every-day names without employing any roundabout, namby-pamby phraseology.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5945"/>This right, this inestimable possession, is the very foundation-stone, or, to change the figure, the tap-root, the great and only source upon and from which all the other powers of inherent, original and undelegated sovereignty spring and depend for their vigor and existence.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5946"/>A monarchy, an oligarchy or a republic that does not by virtue of this great right own the soil which it occupies, cannot be in possession of inherent, original sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6245"/>It has never been questioned by those most conversant with the facts, that she was sunk by a torpedo, but there has always been some doubt as to whether that torpedo was <num value="1">one</num> of those planted by the <quote>rebels,</quote> or was attached to a spar rigged out from the bow of the <rs>Tecumseh</rs>, and whose explosion was caused by her coming in contact with a large iron buoy, anchored near <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName> to indicate the channel to blockade-runners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6246"/>It is a well-known fact that the commander of that ill-fated vessel had asked it as a special favor of <persName n="Farragut,Admiral,,,," id="n0122.0101.00472.05479" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Farragut</surname></persName>, before entering the bay, to let him take care of the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, and I can testify to the fact that he had <pb id="p.473" n="473"/>reserved his fire up to the moment of the sinking of his vessel, although then within <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> of his intended victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6247"/>Whether this was done for the purpose of trying the effect of the torpedo he is believed to have had suspended from his bow before using his <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15-inch</measure> guns, is more than any <num value="1">one</num> now living can positively know, but the probabilities point so plainly in that direction that I am convinced of the justice of this belief.</p>

As for catching a vessel going at a speed of <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> an hour with <num value="1">one</num> utterly incapable of more than half that speed, it is to be presumed that even <persName n="Kinney,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0122.0101.00473.05481" reg="mostcommon:Kinney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Kinney</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> <orgName n="Signal Corps" type="corps">Signal Corps</orgName>, is seaman enough to comprehend the impossibility of such a feat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6249"/>While endeavoring to cross the course of the <rs>Hartford</rs> and run into her, the bow gun of the <rs>Tennessee</rs> (a <measure n="7inch" type="distance">7-inch</measure> rifle) was fired at her twice, at point-blank range, but from some unaccountable cause, both shots failed to do any execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6250"/>The <rs>Hartford</rs> had avoided the blow by slightly changing her course, and had passed beyond the ram into the bay without having received any material damage.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6251"/>Just at this moment of supreme disappointment the crew of the <rs>Tennessee</rs> began to cheer, and upon inquiring the cause my attention was directed to the leading monitor of the fleet, and looking through <num value="1">one</num> of the narrow slits in the side of the pilot-house, I discovered her to be in the act of going down, bottom upward, and <num value="1">one</num> of her boats engaged in rescuing those who had managed to escape from her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6256"/>The <term type="ship">gunboat</term> <rs type="ship">Gaines</rs> was run on the beach near the <rs>Fort</rs> early in the action to prevent her from sinking, having received several shots below her waterline, but she had done her duty nobly up to this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6260"/>When the <rs>Tennessee</rs> had approached a point within a mile of the fleet, the entire number of vessels composing it seemed to vie with each other in the rapidity of their firing, and in efforts to prove their efficiency at rams, by endeavoring to sink the devoted <quote>Rebel,</quote> who had failed to exhibit his qualities in this modern style of warfare, from lack of the important element of speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6261"/>It afterward appeared that in their zeal and haste some of the vessels of the fleet came near sinking their own flag ship, as she was rammed twice by the <rs>Lackawana</rs>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6262"/>The result of such a contest could not have been changed except by the miraculous destruction of the opposing fleet, and if, as <persName n="Kinney,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0122.0101.00474.05484" reg="mostcommon:Kinney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Kinney</surname></persName> states, there ever was a <quote>moment when he hesitated (<persName n="Farragut,,,,," id="n0122.0101.00474.05485" reg="mostcommon:Farragut,nomatch:0"><surname>Farragut</surname></persName>) the fortune of the day must have been against us.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6263"/>I feel quite sure that were the distinguished officer to whom he refers now living, he would scout the idea of such a possibility having ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6264"/>The forts had virtually been passed without sustaining any injury, save the sinking of the <rs>Tecumseh</rs> by a torpedo, and nothing remained for the fleet to do but to capture or destroy <num value="3">three</num> little hastily improvished wooden gun-boats and <num value="1">one</num> iron-clad, with a force <num value="10">ten</num> times their superior in every possible element, excepting only the daring and patriotism which impelled <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0122.0101.00474.05486" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,Franklin,,,"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> with his single vessel of <num value="6">six</num> guns and <num value="170">170</num> men to attack such a fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6267"/>He was singularly insensible to the grandeur of the position he occupied professionally, and in his personal character as gentle and unobtrusive as a woman, while possessing all the qualifications of a naval officer of the highest class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6268"/>There were but few of those under his command who had been favored with a more intimate acquaintance with him, or cherished more kindly personal feelings toward him than myself, and far be it from me to attempt to pluck <num value="1">one</num> leaf from the laurel crown which victory placed upon his brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6269"/>But while awarding a just meed of praise to his merits, let it not be said of those who should, with equal pride, remember his gallant and distinguished adversary on the occasion under review, that sectional feeling blinded their eyes to the equally grand and noble qualities of that adversary, especially as they were both Southern men.</p>
