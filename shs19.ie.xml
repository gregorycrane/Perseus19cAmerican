<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>To these notes the attention of the reader is invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>But as the <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> book is not always accessible, and such versions of occurrences of the war as this of <persName n="Porter,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00016" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> sometimes find their way into crude histories of the day, I deem it proper to present the subject from another point of view, with evidence..</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Early in <dateStruct value="1861-06-"><month reg="06">June</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00017" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Navy, asked me to design an iron-clad.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea presenting itself was a shield of timber <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> thick, plated with <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure> of iron, inclined to the horizontal plane at the least angle that would permit working the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This shield to be supported by a hull of equal length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But it was apparent, on inspection, that to support the massive shield the ends of the vessel would be so full and bluff as to prevent the attainment of speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It then occurred to me that fineness of line, buoyancy, and protection of hull could be obtained by extending the ends of the vessel under water beyond the shield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>To prevent the banking up of water on these submerged ends I erected upon them a superstructure of shipiron, corresponding in form with the hull below, but not higher than would permit the free use of bow and stern guns; these superstructures to be decked.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Of this design I submitted outline drawings&mdash;body, sheer, and deck-plans&mdash;to <persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00018" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, who approved and adopted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I then asked that <persName n="Williamson,Chief-Engineer,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00019" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Chief-Engineer">Chief Engineer</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Porter,Constructor,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00020" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Constructor">Constructor</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> should be sent for from the <rs>Norfolk</rs> navy-yard to put the plan in execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This the <rs>Secretary</rs> declined doing, but ordered a practical mechanic to be sent up from the <rs type="place">Norfolk yard</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The mechanic came, aided in the statement of timber, etc., but was unable to make the working drawings, and was permitted to return to the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><persName n="Porter,Constructor,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00021" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Constructor">Constructor</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> and <persName n="Williamson,Chief-Engineer,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00022" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Chief-Engineer">Chief Engineer</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> were then ordered to report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They came, and we met in consultation with the <rs>Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><persName n="Porter,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00023" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> brought and presented for consideration a model of an iron-clad of the same form as that which I had rejected for reasons above stated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>When we had examined the model, the <rs>Secretary</rs> said he wished to show <persName n="Porter,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00024" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> and <persName n="Williamson,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00025" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Williamson</surname></persName> a plan proposed by <persName n="Brooke,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00026" reg="nearbymention:Brooke,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Brooke</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The plan was then placed before them, and the reasons for extending the ends of the hull beyond the shield and under water were stated, and they approved the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It had been, as stated above, previously adopted by the <name>Department</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><persName n="Mallory,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00027" reg="nearbymention:Mallory,S.,R.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName> then directed <persName n="Williamson,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00028" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Porter,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00004.00029" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Porter</surname></persName> to ascertain if suitable engines and boilers could be had. To me he said: <q direct="unspecified">Make a clean drawing in ink of your plan, to be filed in the department.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>As I placed the paper on the table and was about to begin, <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> <persName n="Porter,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00030" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> said to me: <q direct="unspecified">You had better let me do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I am more familiar than you are with that sort of work.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Accepting his offer I went with <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00031" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName> to the <orgName n="Tredegar Works" type="works">Tredegar Works</orgName>, where we learned that no suitable engines could be had. <persName n="Williamson,,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00032" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><surname>Williamson</surname></persName> then said that the engines of the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00033" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi> could, he thought, be put in working condition, but that the vessel would necessarily have as great a draught as the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00034" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi>, and that it would be useless to build a new hull, as the lower part of the old <num value="1">one</num> had not been destroyed, and the plan could be applied to her. In view of these facts, <persName n="Porter,Constructor,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00035" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Constructor">Constructor</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, who also knew what the condition of the vessel was, agreed with us that the plan could be carried out on her. We all thought the draught too great, but we could not do better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We reported verbally to the <rs>Secretary</rs>; the subject was discussed, and his opinion coincided with ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He then, in order that a record might be preserved, directed us to make a written report in accordance with the results of the discussion.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>As the plan proposed by me had been adopted, I thought it but proper that I should leave the wording of the report to <persName n="Williamson,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00036" reg="nearbymention:Williamson,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Williamson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Porter,Mister,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00037" reg="nearbymention:Porter,John,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Porter</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I noticed that in designating the plan to be adopted the expression used was <q direct="unspecified">the plan submitted for the approval of the <name>Department</name>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><hi rend="italics">Which</hi> plan was not stated.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I now pass to a later period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The action in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> had been fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He had been associated with me in ordnance work, and was fully informed as to the facts in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>From him I received the following letter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It was a great victory, though the odds were nearly <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="1">one</num> against us in guns and in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But the iron and the heavy guns did the work, handled by such a man as glorious old <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n0277.0002.00005.00040" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,F.,,,:1"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> and with such officers and men as we had.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Sir:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In obedience to your order, we have carefully examined and considered the various plans and propositions for constructing a shot-proof steam battery, and respectfully report that, in our opinion, the steam <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs>, which is in such condition from the effects of fire as to be useless for any other purpose without incurring a very heavy expense in her rebuilding, can be made an efficient vessel of that character, mounting <num value="10">ten</num> heavy guns&mdash;<num value="2">two</num> pivot and <num value="8">eight</num> side guns of her original battery; and, from the further consideration that we cannot procure a suitable engine and boilers for any other vessel without building them, which would occupy too much time, it <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> would appear that this is our only chance to get a suitable vessel in a short time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The bottom of the hull, boilers, and heavy and costly parts of the engine being but little injured, reduce the cost of construction to about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the amount which would be required to construct such a vessel anew.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>We cannot, without further examination, make an accurate estimate of the cost of the proposed work, but think it will be about <measure n="110000dollars" type="currency">one hundred and ten thousand dollars</measure>, the most of which will be for labor, the materials being nearly all on hand in the yard, except the iron plating to cover the shield.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>dear Sir:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>I have observed, with surprise and regret, certain articles in the newspapers relating to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></hi> and the origin of the plan upon which she is constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>I shall leave to those qualified to judge the question of whose plan was adopted; for the facts are accessible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But meanwhile I beg leave to call your attention to <num value="1">one</num> remark of your published letter, which is rather obscure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>You say: <quote rend="blockquote"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/></p> 
<p>After the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Merrimac,,,,," id="n0277.0002.00014.00120" reg="mostcommon:Merrimac,nomatch:0"><surname>Merrimac</surname></persName></hi> was in progress some time, <persName n="Brooke,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0002.00014.00121" reg="nearbymention:Brooke,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Brooke</surname></persName> was constantly proposing alterations in her to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Navy">Secretary of the Navy</rs>, and as constantly and firmly opposed by myself, which the <rs>Secretary</rs> knows.</p></quote> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>This paragraph conveys the impression that I proposed alterations which were opposed and rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>As the alterations alluded to affect very materially the efficiency of the ship, I propose to mention them now.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> alteration proposed by me was the substitution of <num value="1">one</num> plate of <measure n="2inch" type="distance">two-inch</measure> iron for <num value="2">two</num> of <measure n="1inch" type="distance">one-inch</measure>; the removal of the ceiling or inner planking of the shield, and the application of <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> of oak outside under the iron, leaving the wood of the shield of the same aggregate thickness; and this alteration was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I subsequently recommended the substitution of <measure n="2inch" type="distance">two-inch</measure> plates.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> proposition made by me was to pierce the shield for bow and quarter ports, for you had omitted them, leaving <num value="4">four</num> points of <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> approach without fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>An accident to the engine, propeller or rudder would have placed the ship at the mercy of an antagonist; and this alteration was made.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> alteration was the removal of the wheel-ropes&mdash;chains&mdash; from beneath the plates outside, where they were liable to be jammed by a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The alteration was not made, however, until <persName n="Jones,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0002.00015.00123" reg="nearbymention:Jones,J.,William,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> called your attention to it a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> alteration was the making of <num value="2">two</num> additional hatches&mdash;your plan of detail providing for only <num value="2">two</num>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> suggestion was that arrangements should be made to permit the use of small-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>You were left to your discretion, but a plan was given, if you could not think of a better <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>You replied at length; the arguments were not considered good, and the alteration would have been made but for the delay which would have attended it. The ship is now deficient in that respect.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> proposition was to put <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> of iron on bow and stern.

I do not doubt the statements of the <rs>Secretary</rs>, but no such plans were submitted to the board; and from the fact that the master-carpenter had returned to this yard without completing any plan as the vessel shows, and myself being sent for immediately, and from the further fact that the <rs>Secretary</rs> presented us no plans from this source, I stated in my last communication that <persName n="Brooke,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0002.00019.00155" reg="nearbymention:Brooke,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Brooke</surname></persName> failed to produce anything after a week's trial; and I am still of that opinion, so far as anything tangible is concerned.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The nature of my invention consists in so constructing the hull of the vessel that her bow and stern <hi rend="italics">A</hi> and <hi rend="italics">B</hi>, Figures I and <num value="2">II</num>, shall each extend beyond the forward and after ends of the shield C, which protects crew and guns, sufficiently to give the sharpness necessary to the attainment of high speed, and the buoyancy to support the weight of iron covering the shield and sides of the vessel <pb id="p.29" n="29"/> without increase of draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Being submerged, all that part of the hull not covered by the shield is protected by the water from the projectiles of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>To divide and prevent the water over the submerged part of the vessel from banking up at the forward or after ends of the shield in going ahead or astern, thereby retarding her progress and perhaps preventing the use of the bow or stern gun, a false bow and stern or tanks are constructed upon the submerged portion of the vessel corresponding more or less in form with the hull below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The false bow and stern may be decked, in which case they should not be so high above water as to interfere with firing of the bow and stern guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>These tanks may be used as reservoirs of water by which the draft of the vessel may be regulated at will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We feel assured their contributious will be perused with pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>In our miscellaneous columns we will have extracts from authors which will be interesting and edifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>In our poetical column will be found gems from celebrated authors, male and female, whose reputation is becoming known; so far as we can we will publish selections that have not appeared in print.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Jumping up, still half asleep, we came on deck, and sure enough, there was the enemy heading for the <q direct="unspecified">passage</q> past the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1184"/>Our coxswain, a burly, gamy Englishman, who by gesture and loud word, was encouraging the crew, steering by the tiller between his knees, his hands occupied in holding his pistols, suddenly fell forward on us dead, a ball having struck him fairly in the forehead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1185"/>The rudder now having no guide, the boat swerved aside, and instead of our <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> bows striking at the gangway, we struck the wheelhouse, so that the next boat, commanded by <persName n="Loyall,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0013.00096.00775" reg="mostcommon:Loyall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Loyall</surname></persName>, had the deadly honor of being <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>Leading his crew, as became his rank, duty and desire, he jumped and pulled into the gangway&mdash;now a blazing sheet of flame, and being nearsighted, having lost his glasses, stumbled and fell prone upon the deck of the gunboat, the <num value="4">four</num> men who were following close up on his heels falling on top of him stone dead, killed by the enemy's bullets; each <num value="1">one</num> of the unfortunate fellows having from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="6">six</num> of them in his body, as we found out later.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>I then jumped down on the deck, and as I struck it, I slipped in the blood, and fell on my back and hands; rising immediately, I caught hold of an officer standing near me, who with an oath collared me, and I threw up his revolver just in time to make myself known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>Following him a short distance in the darkness, I examined a youth who was sitting in the lap of another, and in feeling his head I felt my hand slip down between his ears, and to my horror, discovered that his head had been cleft in <num value="2">two</num> by a boarding sword in the hands of some giant of the forecastle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1193"/>After having finished my examination, <num value="0.5">a half</num> an hour had elapsed, and when ascending to the deck again I heard the officers of the various corps reporting to <persName n="Wood,Commander,,,," id="n0277.0013.00096.00781" reg="nearbymention:Wood,J.,Taylor,,"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName>; for immediately after the capture of the vessel, according to the orders, the engineers and firemen had been sent down to the engine-room to get up steam, and <persName n="Loyall,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0013.00096.00782" reg="mostcommon:Loyall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Loyall</surname></persName> as executive officer, with a number of seamen had attempted to raise the anchor, cast loose the cable which secured the <pb id="p.97" n="97"/> ship to the wharf just under the guns of <placeName key="tgn,7015315" n="1.000 1" reg="sandusky, erie, ohio">Fort Stephenson</placeName>, while the marines in charge of their proper officers were stationed at the gangways guarding the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1194"/>The lieutenants, midshipmen and others manned the guns, of which there were <num value="6">six</num> <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure>, as it was the intention to convert her at once into a Confederate manof-war, and under the captured flag to go out to sea, to take and destroy as many of the vessels of the enemy as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>But all our well-laid plans were abortive; the engineers reported the fires out, and that it would be futile to attempt to get up steam under an hour, and <persName n="Loyall,Lieutenant,,,," id="n0277.0013.00097.00783" reg="mostcommon:Loyall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Loyall</surname></persName>, too, after very hard work, reported it useless to spend any more time in trying to unshuckle the chains, as the ship had been moored to a buoy, unless he could have hours in which to perform the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>Just at this moment, too, to bring things to a climax, the <rs>Fort</rs> under which we found that we were moored bow and stem, opened fire upon us with small arms, grape and solid shot; some of those who had escaped having reported the state of affairs on board, and this was the result.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>In about <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> a solid shot or <num value="2">two</num> had disabled the walking-beam, and it then became evident to all that we were in a trap, to escape from which depended on hard work and strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>How to extricate ourselves in safety from the thus far successful expedition, was the question; but events proved that our commander was equal to the emergency.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>Very calmly and clearly he directed me to remove all dead and wounded to the boats, which the several crews were now hauling to the lee side of the vessel, where they would be protected from the the shots from the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1200"/>The order was soon carried out by willing hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1201"/>They were distributed as equally as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>Each boat in charge of its own proper officer, and subjected under that heavy fire to that rigid discipline characteristic of the navy, manned by their regular crews, as they laid in double lines, hugging the protected lee of the ship as closely as possible, it was a splendid picture of what a a body of trained men can be under circumstances of great danger.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>After an extended search through the ship's decks, above and below, we found that we had removed all the dead and wounded, and then, when the search was ended, reported to <persName n="Wood,Captain,,,," id="n0277.0013.00097.00784" reg="nearbymention:Wood,J.,Taylor,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wood</surname></persName> on the quarter-deck, where, giving his orders where the fire from the fort was very deadly and searching, he called up <num value="4">four</num> lieutenants to him, to whom he gave instructions as follows: <num value="2">two</num> of them were to go below in the forward part of the ship, and the other <num value="2">two</num> below in the afterpart, where from their respective stations they were to fire the vessel, and not to leave her until her decks were all ablaze, and then at that juncture they were to return to their proper boats and report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/><pb id="p.98" n="98"/></p> 
<p>The remainder of us were lying on our oars while orders for firing the ship were being carried out; and soon we saw great columns of red flames shoot upward out of the forward hatch and ward-room, upon which the <num value="4">four</num> officers joined their boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1205"/>Immediately, by the glare of the burning ship, we could see the outlines of the fort with its depressed guns, and the heads and shoulders of the men manning them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>As the blaze grew larger and fiercer their eyes were so dazzled and blinded that every <num value="1">one</num> of our <num value="12">twelve</num> boats pulled away out into the broad estuary safe and untouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1207"/>Then we all realized fully our adroit and successful escape.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>Some years after the affair I met <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Federal</rs> officers who was in the fort at the time, and he told me that they were not only completely blinded by the flames, which prevented them from seeing us, but were also stampeded by the knowledge of the fact that there were several tons of powder in the magazine of the vessel, which when exploded would probably blow the fort to pieces; so, naturally, they did not remain very long after they were aware that the ship had been fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>This all occurred as we had expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>We in our boats, at a safe distance of more than half a mile, saw the <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Underwriter,,,,," id="n0277.0013.00098.00785" reg="mostcommon:Underwriter,nomatch:0"><surname>Underwriter</surname></persName></q> blow up, and distinctly heard the report of the explosion, but those at the fort, a very short distance from the ship, sought a safe refuge, luckily for them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>Fortunately there was no causalities at this stage of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>I boarded boat after boat in my capacity as surgeon, attending to the requirements of those who demanded immediate aid, and I witnessed many amusing scenes; for among the prisoners were some old men-of-war's men, former shipmates of mine in the <rs>Federal</rs> navy years before, and of the other officers also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>Their minds were greatly relieved when I made known to them who their captors were, and that their old surgeon and other officers were present, and as a natural consequences they would be treated well.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>Continuing to pull for the remainder of the night, we sought and found by the aid of our pilot, a safe and narrow creek, up which we ascended, and at sunrise hauled our boats up on a beach, there we carefully lifted out our wounded men, placed them under the shade of trees in the grass, and made them as comfortable as possible under the circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>Then we laid out the dead, and after carefully washing and dressing them, as soon as we had partaken of our breakfast, of which we were in so much need, all hands were called, a long pit was dug in the sand, funeral services were held, the men buried and each grave marked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>We remained there all that day recuperating, and when night came again embarked on our return trip; all through that night and the <num value="4">four</num> succeeding ones, we cautiously <pb id="p.99" n="99"/> pulled up the rapid <rs>Neuse</rs>, doing most of our work in the darkness, until when nearing <placeName reg="Kingstown, Cleveland, North Carolina" key="tgn,2438682">Kingston</placeName> we could with impunity pull in daylight.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1217"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Kingstown, Cleveland, North Carolina" key="tgn,2438682">Kingston</placeName>, the boats were dragged up the hill to the long train of gondola cars which had been waiting for us, and then was presented an exhibition of sailors' ingenuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>The boats were placed upright on an even keel lengthwise on the flat cars, and so securely lashed by ropes that the officers, men, even the wounded, seated and laid in them as if on the water, comfortably and safely made the long journey of a day and <num value="2">two</num> nights to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>Arriving, the boats were unshipped into the <placeName key="tgn,1121283" n="1.000 30" reg="appomattox, virginia, united states">Appomattox river</placeName>, and the entire party floated down it to <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName> where it debouches into the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>It was contemplated that when <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 1473" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> was reached to make a dash at any <num value="1">one</num> Federal gunboat, should there be the slightest prospect of success; but learning from our scouts, on our arrival after dark, that the gunboats and transports at anchor there equalled the number of our own boats at least, we had to abandon our ideas of trying to make a capture, and were compelled to hug the opposite banks very closely, where the river is nearly <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> wide, and in that manner slip up the <rs>James</rs> pulling hard against the current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>By the next evening we arrived, without any further adventure, at <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>, where we disembarked; our boats shown as mementoes of the searching fire we had been subjected to&mdash;for they all were perforated by many minnie balls, the white wooden plugs inserted into the holes averaging <num value="14">fourteen</num> to each boat engaged; they were all shot into them from stem to stern lengthwise.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>Among the many incidents that occurred on the trip there were <num value="2">two</num> which left a lasting impression on my mind, and to this day they are as vivid as if they had happened yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>As we were stepping into the boats at the island that night, the lights of the gunboat plainly visible from the spot on which we stood, a bloody, serious action inevitable, several of the midshipmen, youth-like, were gaily chatting about what they intended to do&mdash;joyous and confident, and choosing each other for mates to fight together shoulder to shoulder&mdash;when <num value="1">one</num> of them who stood near me in the darkness made the remark, as a conclusion as we were taking our places in the boats:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/><q direct="unspecified">I wonder, boys, how many of us will be up in those stars by tomorrow morning?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>This rather jarred on the ears of we older ones, and looking around to see who it was that had spoken, I recognized the bright and handsome <persName n="Sanders,,Palmer,,," id="n0277.0013.00099.00786" reg="default:Sanders,Palmer,,,"><foreName>Palmer</foreName> <surname>Sanders</surname></persName>.

<p>On our route down to <placeName reg="Kingstown, Cleveland, North Carolina" key="tgn,2438682">Kingston</placeName> by rail we were obliged to make frequent stops for wood and water, and at every station the young midshipmen swarmed into the depots and houses, full of their fun and deviltry, making friends of the many pretty girls gathered there, who asked all manner of questions as to this strange sight of boats on cars filled with men in a uniform new to them.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>The young gentlemen explained very glibly what they were going to do&mdash;<q direct="unspecified">to board, capture and destroy as many of the enemy's gunboats as possible.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/><q direct="unspecified">Well, when you return,</q> replied the girls, <q direct="unspecified">be sure that you bring us some relics&mdash;flags, &amp;c.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/></p> 
<p>With blushes and much confusion, the girls consented, and in a few moments we were off and away on our journey again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>On the return trip the young men, never for an instant forgetting the bargain they had made, manufactured several miniature flags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>We old ones purposely stopped at all the stations we had made coming down in order to see the fun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>dear&mdash;&mdash;:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>I am glad to say I am in excellent health, and have been, except for a few days, ever since I have been in the service, and the sick of our company and regiment are improving.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>Last evening was a joyful <num value="1">one</num> to the <orgName type="regiment" key="1NCRegiment">First North Carolina Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>Near night I heard loud shouting throughout the entire camp, and on inquiring the cause, found it was because of the arrival of our much-loved <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0277.0031.00240.02437" reg="nearbymention:Hill,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, who has been absent from us some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, trying to regain his health, which had been much impaired by his constant and arduous duties at <placeName key="tgn,2115169" n="1.000 5" reg="yorktown, york, virginia">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>He looks quite feeble, but I find him early this morning on his horse, and I venture to say that horse will not be unsaddled until his rider has carefully examined every nook and corner in and around <placeName reg="Ship Point, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2659792">Ship Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>Last night about <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> the <rs>General</rs> found his tent literally surrounded by over <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men, who gave <num value="3">three</num> loud, long and lasting cheers for <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n0277.0031.00240.02438" reg="nearbymention:Hill,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, and then called him out. He said he had been outflanked and surrounded, and must surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3197"/>He was glad to be with us once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3198"/>In his late sickness he had probably suffered more than he had in all his life before; but nothing troubled him more than his being compelled to be away from his regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3199"/>He wanted to be with them in their sickness and camp trials, and if they got into an engagement, he wanted to be there to <hi rend="italics">show them how to dodge</hi>. We had whipped the <rs>Yankees</rs> once, and could do it again, if we put our trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and keep our powder dry. He was afraid there was too much disposition to place our trust in man. Too many said I will do this; we can do that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3200"/><pb id="p.241" n="241"/> This was all wrong, for if we did not trust in Him who does all things well, bravery and daring would avail but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3201"/>It was true we had bad news from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>; but this must not discourage us, for we must learn to expect and endure reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3202"/>We had been too prone to underrate the courage of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3203"/>Their cause was bad; <hi rend="italics">that</hi> alone made them cowards, and in such a cause we, too, would be cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3204"/>He knew the commander at <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, and a braver man he never knew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3205"/>After a few other well-timed remarks, he closed by thanking us for the honor we had done him. <num value="3">Three</num> cheers for <persName n="Lee,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n0277.0031.00241.02439" reg="nearbymention:Lee,C.,C.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> were then given, and he, too, favored us with a few remarks, saying that he had been with us <hi rend="italics">every day</hi>, and that we had done our duty while under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3206"/>He was glad to be an officer of the <orgName type="regiment" n="NC1">North Carolina First</orgName>; and if in the future we did as well as we had done in the past, he would always be proud of us. Had <persName n="Lane,Major,,,," id="n0277.0031.00241.02440" reg="nearbymention:Lane,J.,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Lane</surname></persName> been here, he, too, would have been called out, for <hi rend="italics">everybody</hi> likes <persName n="Lane,,,,," id="n0277.0031.00241.02441" reg="nearbymention:Lane,J.,H.,,"><surname>Lane</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3207"/>Like <persName n="Marion,General,,,," id="n0277.0031.00241.02442" reg="mostcommon:Marion,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Marion</surname></persName>, he is a little man, but he has a big soul.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3208"/>We are much tickled to see how certain newspapers in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> represent us as in a destitute and starving condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3209"/>You ought to be here to see how <hi rend="italics">fast</hi> we are starving, with plenty of flour, meal, rice and bacon, to say nothing of potatoes and fish of all kinds, both plenty and cheap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>The truth is, I have just eaten so heartily of fine large sheep-head (equal to our finest shad) that I am almost too lazy to finish this letter.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3211"/>The sick of our regiment are surprised to find the papers place them in such a destitute condition; neglected by their officers and uncared for by the physicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3212"/>This is news to them, for no man who has ever seen service can say that the sick of this regiment have not fared as well and better than is usual in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3213"/>Since we have been here, every <num value="2">two</num> companies have a physician specially detailed for service in those companies alone, and this, too, in addition to the regular physicians of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3214"/>They have all done their duty nobly, and deserve and will receive the lasting thanks of the men. Another item of news is, we have been over-worked and compelled to endure long marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3215"/>Like the rest, I have only to say our friends in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> found this out <hi rend="italics">before we did</hi>. Since the <rs n="Battle of Bethel" type="battle">battle of Bethel</rs> we don't mind a little dirt digging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3216"/>It is a good sauce for our rations, and besides, too, these embankments are sometimes very convenient, and we dig at them with a hearty good will, for we did not come to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to keep our hands in our pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3217"/><pb id="p.242" n="242"/></p> 
<p>We have another item of late and reliable news from these same papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3218"/>Some scribbler from <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName> tells us that we have never received our pay because of the ignorance or neglect of the officers of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3219"/>Now, the truth is, the officers are the only men in the regiment who draw <hi rend="italics">no rations</hi>, and have been compelled to pay their way ever since they left home, to say nothing of a <num value="100">hundred</num> other petty expenses to which they have been subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3220"/>The author of such a contemptible charge has either told a wilful falsehood, or is guilty of <hi rend="italics">pitiable ignorance</hi>. Our regiment has fared as well as any in the field, for we have in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> friends who have been liberal and kind, and if the <rs>Yankees</rs> give us a chance, we will try to exhibit our gratitude in a <hi rend="italics">striking manner</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3221"/>I am glad to have to add that <persName n="McL,Doctor,D.,,," id="n0277.0031.00242.02443" reg="default:McL,D.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>McL</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3223"/>I like to see privates elevated, who started from home on <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">$11</measure> per month, and did not wait, like some, to get offices before they started.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3227"/>It is with mingled feelings of pride and pleasure that I find myself addressing a <orgName type="mil" key="NCRegiment">North Carolina regiment</orgName> upon the soil of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>&mdash;the home of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n0277.0031.00242.02448" reg="mostcommon:Washington,George,,,:4"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>&mdash;and that, too, near the battle-field of <placeName key="tgn,2115169" n="1.000 5" reg="yorktown, york, virginia">Yorktown</placeName>, where in the days of the <name>Revolution</name> the clarion voice of the <rs>Father</rs> of his Country was heard, leading our noble sires to glory, to <pb id="p.243" n="243"/> victory and renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3228"/>Aye, it was on this spot, in the days that tried men's souls, that the smoke of battle might have been seen ascending from the valley and the hill top; it was here that <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>, the pet of the lion <rs>King</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, surrendered his sword to the leader of that little <orgName n="Spartan Band" type="band">Spartan band</orgName> who were then in mortal strife for their homes, their firesides and for liberty, that inestimable boon which they have given us as an inheritance, and which we so highly prize, that anathema would be pronounced upon any degenerate son who would essay to name its equivalent.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3229"/>Is it not, my friends, a remarkable coincidence that you are here to-day, in this boasted age of progress in civil and religious liberty, near the same spot, prompted by the same motives and actuated by the same feelings that animated the breasts of your noble ancestors, in making red with blood the field of <placeName key="tgn,2115169" n="1.000 5" reg="yorktown, york, virginia">Yorktown</placeName> and consecrating it to liberty, and as it was their mission then so it is yours to-day to lay bleaching upon the plains of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> the bones of the invader who is seeking to rob you of your birthright, to subjugate, devastate, lay waste and utterly destroy, aye, everything that is near and dear to the heart of an American freeman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3230"/>Continue, my friends, to meet them as you have begun upon the threshold; meet them, as I know you will do, like men; let their blood be upon their own hands; let their graves be in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 19" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3231"/>As to how you have acquitted yourselves as soldiers thus far, I must be permitted to say that you have discharged your every duty with a conscientious regard for the welfare of your country, which will ever endear you to every true Southron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3232"/>With characteristic patience and cheerfulness you have submitted to the many hardships and inconveniences which must ever be attendant upon the tented field; and you have yielded implicit confidence and obedience to the orders of your superior officers, which is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty of soldiers, and by so doing you have gained the applause of our entire army as being <num value="1">one</num> of the best disciplined, best officered regiments now in the tented field; and your many friends at home feel that while you have a Magruder, a Hill, a Lee, a Lane, <hi rend="italics">et als</hi> of the same stamp to lead you, that they have nothing to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3277"/>This was the question that occupied officers and crew on watch and off watch continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3278"/>What was to be done with the <q direct="unspecified">Monitor?</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3279"/>Well, I'll tell you what we decided to do with her, <hi rend="italics">capture her alive</hi>! With this express object in view, and for this very purpose, we organized a boarding party, consisting of <num value="4">four</num> divisions, and each division assigned to its own special part of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3280"/>Volunteers were called for to join in the undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3281"/>So daring was the enterprise regarded that no <num value="1">one</num> was compelled to join in it.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3282"/>I can remember now, through the mists of <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, how we younsters in the midshipmens' mess confidently expected to return from our next engagement with the <q direct="unspecified">Monitor</q> <hi rend="italics">in tow as our prisoner</hi>!

Inspired by this hope, and full of confidence, we exerted ourselves to the uttermost, and spared no pains to make the expedition a success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3283"/>The boarding party numbered <pb id="p.248" n="248"/> about <num value="50">fifty</num>, and every man was drilled in his own particular part like a veteran, during all the time we spent in the dry-dock.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3284"/>The plan was very simple, and seemed entirely practicable, provided we should not all be blown out of the water before it could be carried into execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3285"/>Any how we were prepared to try it; and it was this: We had <num value="4">four</num> of our smaller gunboats ready to take the party, some of each division on each vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3286"/><num value="1">One</num> division was provided with grappling-irons and lines; another with wedges and mallets; another with tarpaulins, and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> chloroform, hand grenades, etc. I venture the assertion that no other expedition ever started into battle similarly armed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3287"/>Well, the idea was for all <num value="4">four</num> of these vessels to pounce down on the <q direct="unspecified">Monitor</q> at the same time; on a given signal, and from different directions, all hands were to rush on board, wedge the turret so as to prevent its revolving, then scale its sides, deluge the interior with chloroform by breaking the bottles on the upper deck, and then cover the turret and pilot-house with tarpaulins, and wait for the crew to surrender.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3298"/> If there be an ambition in the soul of man more prominent or more esteemed among men than another, it is that of deep and earnest gratitude for blessings vouchsafed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3299"/>It is that <num value="1">one</num> universal thread which binds all hearts in <num value="1">one</num>, uniting that <num value="1">one</num> to the heart of Him who sits the enthroned Potentate of the <name>Universe</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3300"/>If ever there was a time which called loudly for the exhibition of this holy emotion, it is the great and illustrious present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3301"/>If ever there were individuals or a people who should anxiously desire to manifest it in words and deeds by some public and appropriate exercise, <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are the men; <hi rend="italics">we</hi>, the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>, are the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3302"/>The present is undoubtedly an occasion when, after some special manner, we should render to Him who presides over the destinies of nations, and who is the <rs>Sovereign Ruler</rs> of events, the sacrifical offering of praise and grateful adoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3303"/>For, over and above the ordinary occurrences of this most wicked and unrighteous war which call forth our gratitude to the great <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of heaven and earth, this is a signal mercy&mdash;an extraordinary, if not miraculous deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3304"/>And as we set up in conspicuous places the statues of heroes and of illustrious patriots who have well deserved the praise and honor of their fellow-countrymen, thus upholding their memory to future generations, and inciting others to the imitation of their valorous deeds, just so should we, as it were, in the loftiest and securest apartments of the soul, erect mementoes of the gracious dealings of a kind and watchful <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, in order that our spirits, surveying the brilliant record of past distinguished services, <pb id="p.250" n="250"/> may be kept always attuned to praise and gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3305"/>Then, undoubtedly, as we have already stated, the mercy for which we are at this time assembled to express our thanksgiving with the voice of grateful adoration deserves to be classed amongst the special and extraordinary mercies of Jehovah's merciful and gracious providence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3306"/>When, a few days ago, at the suggestion of our highly-esteemed <rs type="role2">President</rs>, we observed a day of solemn fasting, humiliation and prayer, on account of our recent disasters, men's hearts sank within them, and there was a dread at every throb of the electric wire, lest it should bring to us fresh tidings of calamitous reverse and defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3307"/>We had heard of the surrender of our little army and the destruction of a portion of our utterly inadequate fleet at <placeName reg="Roanoke, Roanoke, Virginia" key="tgn,7014343">Roanoke</placeName>, while the dispatches from the far <rs>West</rs> were sadly disheartening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3308"/>Truly were our spirits downcast and disquited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3309"/>But now, now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3310"/>how suddenly all is changed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3311"/>The sunshine of a favoring <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> beams upon every countenance!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3312"/>Our arms have been marvellously crowned with a brilliant success!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3313"/>A handful of men, as it were, have defeated <num value="1000">thousands</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3314"/>Heroes have suddenly arisen who have made themselves names high up on the monuments of fame, which shall never, never perish!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3315"/>Officers and crews have alike shown themselves equal to the most fearful emergencies!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3316"/>And the happy result is that the fierce weapons of our insolent invaders are broken; the enemies' mighty ships are spoiled; our long-blockaded port is once again thrown open, and our hearts are filled with joy and gratitude at the great and glorious victory!</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3317"/>And now, whom are we to thank for all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3318"/>Doubtless I may take upon myself the liberty of expressing, on the part of the people, their acknowledgment to you, individually and collectively for this distinguished and valorous deed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3319"/>Our Government cannot be too lavish in tendering the thanks of the nation to the wise and gallant men who, by their undaunted bravery and their prudential counsels and by their unhesitating devotion to their country's sacred cause, have rolled back the tide of invasion from our immediate shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3320"/>But thine hand, O <name n="God" type="God">Lord God</name> Almighty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3321"/>and Thine alone hath really brought about this happy result!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3322"/>Thine, O <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, is the greatness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3323"/>Thine, O <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, is the power!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3324"/>Thine, O <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, is the victory!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3325"/>Thine, O <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, is the majesty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3326"/>And, therefore, are we now assembled to bring before the <rs>Lord</rs> our <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the glorious tribute of our praise and thanksgiving.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3327"/><q direct="unspecified">I invite you, therefore, my brave friends, without any further remarks, to join me in this act of gratitude to the <name>Almighty</name>, who has <pb id="p.251" n="251"/> afforded you the opportunity to render such distinguished service to your country, and to the cause of justice and true liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3328"/>Lift up your hearts in sincerity and truth, that the words of your mouth may be acceptable in the sight of the <rs>Lord</rs>, your Saviour and vindicator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3329"/>In his infinite mercy and goodness the most blessed and glorious <name n="God" type="God">Lord God</name> has preserved your life from every harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3330"/>When death-shots were falling around you thick and fast and heavy, He rescued you from the jaws of fearful destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3331"/>Let us, therefore, humbly present ourselves before His Divine Majesty to offer the sacrifice of grateful praise and adoration, remembering in your prayers your own individual preservation, and forgetting not the sufferings of your wounded officers and companions in arms, and the sorrows of the afflicted friends and relatives of those who have gallantly fallen upon the altar of their country.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3332"/></p> 
<p>Hereupon followed suitable prayers;(original and from the <rs>Book</rs> of Common Prayer) of Thanksgiving for the victory; of supplication in behalf of the wounded, and the bereaved friends and relatives of the heroic dead; and a general prayer in behalf of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, their rulers, and their valiant men of war&mdash;all falling to the deck upon their knees and bowing their heads in reverance and godly fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3333"/>During this solemn and most impressive scene, while the earnest voice of the young divine was pouring forth eloquent words of gratitude and praise into the ear of the <name n="God" type="God">Lord God</name> of Sabbaoth, the weather-beaten faces of many of the gallant seamen were observed to be bathed in tears, and trembling with emotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3334"/>Surely, I thought, as I turned away from such an affecting scene, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> cannot refuse to accept such an act of thanksgiving; our cause cannot but prosper when the men who are engaged in it recognize the hand of the <name>Almighty</name> in each event, and trust entirely to His guidance, protection, and blessing. </p><closer><signed>spectator.</signed></closer></body></text> </p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3956"/>Nearly every shot must have told, for the line of battle halted, wavered, and fell back in disorder.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3968"/>While the interesting preliminary engagement which I have attempted to describe was going on in our front an important movement was in progress on our left, which was to end disastrously to our little army on that eventful day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3970"/>But even then no disposition that I could see was made to meet this flank movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3971"/>Perhaps there were no troops to spare for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3972"/>The heavy body of infantry in our front continued to move up so slowly as to make it evident to my mind that they were only brought to hold our attention until the troops moving to our left were in a position to strike us immediately on our left flank, which it did not take them long to do. Several heavy volleys of musketry were heard to the left and rear and a few minutes afterward our little squad of cavalry broke through the woods near our position and did not tarry long enough to tell us the news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3973"/>An effectual attempt was then made to get our infantry from behind the breastworks to meet this attack on the left, but it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3974"/>A large body of the enemy had commenced to pour their fire into us from that direction, while heavy masses of infantry were now advancing rapidly from the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3975"/>In the mean time a remarkable change had taken place in the battery to which I belonged.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3977"/>The ammunition had been poured out on the ground behind each of these guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3978"/>I have never <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> been able to account for the singular order, except on the supposition that these <num value="2">two</num> pieces, together with the cannoneers belonging to them, were left to be sacrificed&mdash;to be fought to the last, and by that means to give the infantry and other troops on that part of the line a chance to get out of the trap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3979"/>After this unsuccessful attempt to change front under such a heavy cross-fire our infantry had been withdrawn, and the <num value="2">two</num> pieces of artillery, with the detachments of cannoneers necessary to work them, were left alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3980"/>Of course I had no means of ascertaining the number, but I believe that at the least <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> of the enemy's infantry were advancing on us from <num value="2">two</num> different directions.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3986"/>Our cannister was now gone and I was sitting on a pile of ammunition behind the gun giving out shells and case-shot in which no fuse had been fixed, because the enemy was now so close on us that fuse could not be used to any advantage.</p></div2>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3989"/>We seized a prolong which <pb id="p.294" n="294"/> he had fixed on to the trail and pulled the gun down the hill perhaps <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure>, when the captain, seeing the <rs>Yankees</rs> were so close on us that we must have been killed or captured in a minute or <num value="2">two</num> more, ordered us to leave the gun and save ourselves if we could.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3999"/>But the adventures of the day were not over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4000"/>I have yet to relate an incident showing the conspicuous bravery of the men composing a small remnant of a Louisiana brigade, which had been formerly under the command of <persName n="Hays,General,,,," id="n0277.0045.00294.02889" reg="mostcommon:Hays,William,,,:4"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hays</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4008"/></p> 
<p>I hurried on in the direction of the turnpike, where I hoped to fall in with some of our troops, who might have spirit enough left to make some sort of stand against the victorious enemy, and at least try to prevent our demoralized army from being entirely destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4555"/>Business had made me a frequent visitor to the metropolis of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> during the war, and I could always tell quite accurately how the war was going by the countenance and demeanor of its inhabitants, which to me were a more certain criterion than the daily papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4580"/>At no time did they fear their own servants; indeed, I was afterward assured that the many negroes who filled the streets and welcomed the <rs>Union</rs> troops would have resisted any attack upon the households of their old masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4581"/><pb id="p.331" n="331"/></p> 
<p>The behavior of many of the old family servants was very marked in the care and great solicitude shown by them for their masters during this trying period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4582"/>As an amusing instance of this, I will tell this incident:</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4583"/>An old lady had a very bright, good-looking maid servant, to whom some of the <rs>Union</rs> officers had shown considerable attention by taking her out driving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4584"/>The girl came in <num value="1">one</num> morning and asked her old mistress if she would not take a drive with her in the hack which stood at the door, with her sable escort in waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4585"/>Doubtless this was done not in a spirit of irony, but really in feeling for her old mistress.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4591"/>Sauntering along the street, making a few purchases preparatory to leaving the doomed city, I was suddenly accosted by a friend, who with trembling voice and terrified countenance exclaimed:</p> 
<p>

<p>He overwhelmed me with thanks, crammed my pockets full of Confederate notes, filled my haversack with rations for several days, and I left next morning for <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4598"/>The train not being allowed to enter the city, we had to make a mile or more in a conveyance of some kind at an exorbitant price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4599"/>Learning that the <rs>Weldon</rs> train ran only at night for fear of the <rs>Yankee</rs> batteries which were alarmingly near, I had time to inspect the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4600"/>I found here a marked contrast to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4601"/>As I passed along its streets viewing the marks of shot and shell on every side, hearing now and then the heavy, sullen boom of the enemy's guns, seeing on every hand the presence of war, I noticed its business men had, nevertheless, a calm, determined look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4602"/>Its streets were filled with women and children, who seemed to know no fear, though at any moment a shrieking shell might dash among them, but each eye would turn in loving confidence to the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag which floated over the headquarters of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n0277.0053.00332.03343" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, feeling that they were secure as long as he was there.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4603"/>That night, when all was quiet and darkness reigned, with not a light to be seen, our train quietly slipped out of the city like a blockade-runner passing the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4604"/>The passengers viewed in silence the flashing of the guns as they were trying to locate the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4605"/>It was a moment of intense excitement, but on we crept until at last the captain came along with a lantern and said, <q direct="unspecified">All right!</q>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4607"/>Hastening on my journey, I found the young lady, and telling her she must face the <rs>Yankee</rs> batteries if she would see her home, I found her even enthusiastic at the idea, and we hastily left, though under protest of her friends.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4608"/>Returning the same route&mdash;which, indeed, was the only <num value="1">one</num> now left&mdash;we approached to within <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName></placeName> and waited for darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4609"/>The lights were again extinguished, the passengers warned to tuck their heads low, which in many cases was done by lying flat on the floor, and then we began the ordeal, moving very <pb id="p.333" n="333"/> slowly, sometimes halting, at every moment fearing a shell from the belching batteries, which had heard the creaking of the train and were <q direct="unspecified">feeling</q> for our position.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5348"/>And in order that this may be seen, I feel constrained to quote the passage from <q direct="unspecified"><persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n0277.0061.00378.03818" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> in the <name>Camp</name></q> in full, although I am <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num> to do so, as the anecdote proved to be a <q direct="unspecified">baseless canard.</q>
