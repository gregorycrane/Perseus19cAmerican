Its purpose was the security of property and existing franchises, and not the abolition of privilege, or the equalization of political power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The chiefs of the nobility who, in <dateStruct value="1640--"><year reg="1640">1640</year></dateStruct>, had led the people in its struggle for liberty, had, from the passionate enthusiasm of <q direct="unspecified">a generous inexperience,</q> been hurried, against their design, into measures which their interests opposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Made circumspect by the past, the renewed contest did not disturb their prudence, nor triumph impair their moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Avoiding the collisions with established privileges that spring from the fanatical exaggeration of abstract principles, still placing the hope of security on the system of checks and the balance of opposing powers, they made haste to finish the work of establishing the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The character of the new monarch of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> could mould its policy, but not its constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>True to his purposes, he yet wins no sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In political sagacity, in force of will, far superior to the <rs>English</rs> statesmen who environed him; more tolerant than his ministers or his parliaments, the childless man seems like the unknown <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> character in algebra which is introduced to form the<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> equation, and dismissed when the problem is solved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In his person thin and feeble, with eyes of a hectic lustre, of a temperament inclining to the melancholic, in conduct cautious, of a self-relying humor, with abiding impressions respecting men, he sought no favor, and relied for success on his own inflexibility and tile greatness and maturity of his designs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Too wise to be cajoled, too firm to be complaisant, no address could sway his resolve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7016845" n="1.000 4" reg="nederland">Holland</placeName>, he had not scrupled to derive an increase of power from the crimes of rioters and assassins; in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, no filial respect diminished the energy of his ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>His exterior was chilling; yet he had a passionate delight in horses and the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In conversation he was abrupt, speaking little and slowly, and with repulsive dryness; in the day of battle, he was all activity, and the highest energy of life, without kindling his passions, animated his frame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>His trust in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> was so connected with faith in general laws, that, in every action, he sought the principle which should range it on an absolute decree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Thus, unconscious to himself, he had sympathy with the people, who always have faith in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <name>English</name> statesmen who settled the principles of the revolution, careless of ideal excellence, took experience for their guide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is true that <persName n="Somers,,,,," id="n0328.0001.00004.00002" reg="mostcommon:Somers,nomatch:0"><surname>Somers</surname></persName>, the acknowledged leader of the <orgName n="Whig Party" type="party">whig party</orgName>, of plebeian origin, and unsupported by inherited fortune, was ready, with the new king from a Calvinistic commonwealth, to admit corresponding maxims of government and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Yet, free from fanaticism, even to indifference, by nature, by his profession as a lawyer, and by the tastes which he had cultivated, averse to metaphysical abstractions, he labored to confirm <name>English</name> liberties, not to establish the rights of man; to make an inventory of the privileges of Englishmen, and imbody them in a public law, and not to introduce a new capitulation, or to establish a perfect republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Freedom sought its title-deeds, not in the nature of man, but in the experience of the past, in records, charters, and prescription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The revolution of <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct> was made, not on a theory of absolute justice, but on the facts friendly to freedom which were claimed as the inheritance of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <rs n="Bill of Rights" type="document">bill of rights</rs> was regarded as a distinct, written recapitulation of ancient, well-established national possessions; <name>English</name> liberties, questioned by the abdicated king, were now adapted to the spirit of the age, and, with some <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> increase, were reasserted and confirmed as an inalien-<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> able property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The tide of <name>English</name> liberty was advancing; the rising wave rolled beyond the highest mark of that which was receding.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In the progress of civilization, the human mind had been steadily tending towards the principle of inquiry and freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This principle could not as yet conquer for itself a place in the laws; yet the only ground on which its admission could consistently be refused was abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <orgName n="Anglican Church" type="church">Anglican church</orgName>, which, under the guardianship of authority, had aspired to assert for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> unity of faith, as the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic church</orgName> had claimed to assert it for the whole human race, still retained the monopoly of political power; but a statute, narrow, indeed, in theory, and penuriously conceding a limited enfranchisement of mind as a privilege, tolerated dissenters, and opened a career to freedom of religious opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>With unrelenting zeal, the <q direct="unspecified">Protestant</q> revolution did, indeed, persecute the <rs>Roman Catholics</rs> as a defeated tyranny, oppressed them with civil disfranchisements, and left them without allies, exposed to the vindictive severities of legal despotism; but for Protestant liberty and philosophic freedom the victory was decisive.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The ancient monarchical system, which had connected the unity of truth with authority, had also asserted the necessity of order in the state, under the doctrine of the personal, divine right of the king to the sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This right was maintained by the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic church</orgName> against every power but its own. Protestantism abolished the supremacy of the <rs>Roman</rs> see; and the monarchical reformers, <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName>, <persName n="Cranmer,,,,," id="n0328.0001.00005.00003" reg="mostcommon:Cranmer,nomatch:0"><surname>Cranmer</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ridley,,,,," id="n0328.0001.00005.00004" reg="mostcommon:Ridley,nomatch:0"><surname>Ridley</surname></persName>, <persName n="Latimer,,,,," id="n0328.0001.00005.00005" reg="mostcommon:Latimer,nomatch:0"><surname>Latimer</surname></persName>, the homilies of the <orgName n="Anglican Church" type="church">Anglican church</orgName>, recognized legitimacy without reserve, and opposing <pb id="p.6" n="6"/> the <rs>Roman</rs> pretension to a power of dispensing from<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> allegiance, taught passive obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The right of resistance&mdash;familiar to <persName><foreName>Calvin</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Knox,,,,," id="n0328.0001.00006.00006" reg="nearbymention:Knox,John,,,"><surname>Knox</surname></persName>, to the early Puritans and the <name>Presbyterians</name>, not of itself a democratic doctrine, but rather the most cherished principle of feudal liberty, familiar to the nobles of every monarchy in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>&mdash;was the next conquest in the progress of popular freedom: the idea of popular power would follow, but was not yet ripe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The revolution of <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct> dismissed the doctrine of passive obedience from the statute-book, to take its place, for the <rs>English</rs> world, among exploded superstitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The old system of legitimacy, as it had existed in the monarchies of Christendom, was summoned to expire, and yielded, not as in <placeName reg="Danmark, Europe, " key="tgn,1000066">Denmark</placeName>, and afterwards in <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, to a military monarchy, nor yet to the supremacy of reason as expressed by the popular conviction, but to the transition theory of a social compact, to constitutional monarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The commons, by a vast majority, declared the executive power to be a conditional trust; and the hereditary assembly of patricians, struggling in vain for a compromise with legitimacy by the appointment of a regency friendly to the church, or by simply acknowledging the accession of the next unquestioned heir, at length, after earnest debates, submitted to confess an original contract between king and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The election of <persName><foreName>William</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>to be king for life was a triumph of the perseverance of the more popular party in the commons over the deep, inherited prejudices of the high aristocracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>In this lies the democratic tendency that won to the revolution the scattered remnant of <q direct="unspecified">the good old</q> republican <q direct="unspecified">cause;</q> this appropriated to the whigs the glory of the change, in which they exulted, and of which the tories regretted <pb id="p.7" n="7"/> and excused the necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This also has commended<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> to the friends of freedom the epoch in which the great-European world beheld a successful insurrection against legitimacy and authority over mind.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>By resolving that <persName><foreName>James</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>had abdicated, the representatives of the <rs>English</rs> people assumed to sit in judgment on its kings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>By declaring the throne vacant, they annihilated the principle of legitimacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>By disfranchising a dynasty for professing the <rs>Roman</rs> faith, they not only exerted the power of interpreting the original contract, but of introducing into it new conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>By electing a king, they made themselves his constituents; and the <orgName n="England Parliament" type="parliament">parliament of England</orgName> became the fountain of sovereignty for the <rs>English</rs> world.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The royal prerogative of a veto on <name>English</name> legislation soon fell into disuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The dispensing power was expressly abrogated, or denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The judiciary was rendered independent of the crown; so that enfranchisements were safe against executive interference, and state trials ceased to be collisions between bloodthirsty hatred and despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>For <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, parliament was absolute.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The progress of civilization had gradually elevated the commercial classes, and given importance to towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It now set up, as its landmark and evidence of advancement, the acknowledged influence and power of the men of business; of those who make the exchanges between the consumer and the producer, and those also who assist the exchanges by advances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The reverence for the landed aristocracy was deeply branded into the rural mind; in the parliament of <persName n="Cromwell,,Richard,,," id="n0328.0001.00007.00007" reg="default:Cromwell,Richard,,,"><foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>, it had even been said that the country people were ready to become insurgents for <pb id="p.8" n="8"/> their restoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It was in cities and towns, among<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> those engaged in commerce, in which the ancient patricians had no share, that the spirit of liberty became active, and was quickened by the cupidity which sought new benefits for trade through political influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The day for shouting liberty and equality had not come; the cry was, <q direct="unspecified">Liberty and property.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The revolution was made by the property of the country, and wealth became a power in the state; and when, at elections, the country people were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> invited to seek other representatives than the large landholders, it was not the leveller or the republican, but the merchant, or a candidate in the interest of the merchant, who taught the timid electors their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lessons in independence.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But the moneyed class gained influence in <num value="2">two</num> other modes&mdash;the manner of granting supplies, and the credit system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The civil list was fixed for the whole reign; all other supplies were granted annually, and were subjects of special appropriation; so that the king, who had been elected by parliament, was subject to its enactments, and, dependent on its annual supplies, was also held responsible for the expenditure of the public treasure.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Moreover, as the expenses of wars soon exceeded the revenue of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the government prepared to avail itself of the largest credit which, not the accumulations of wealth only, but the floating credits of commerce and the funding system, could supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The price of such aid was political influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>That the government should, as its paramount policy, promote commerce, domestic manufactures, and a favorable balance of trade; that the classes benefited by this policy should sustain the government with their credit <pb id="p.9" n="9"/> and their wealth, was the reciprocal relation and com-<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> promise, on which rested the fate of parties in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The floating credits of commerce, aided by commercial accumulations, soon grew powerful enough to balance the landed interest: stock aristocracy competed with feudalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>So imposing was the spectacle of the introduction of the citizens and of commerce as the arbiter of alliances, the umpire of factions, the judge of war and peace, that it roused the attention of speculative men; that, at last, <address><street n="Bolingbroke street">Bolingbroke</street></address>, claiming to speak for the landed aristocracy, described his opponents, the whigs, as the party of the banks, the commercial corporations, and, <q direct="unspecified">in general, the moneyed interest;</q> and the gentle <rs>Addison</rs>, espousing the cause of the burghers, declared nothing to be more reasonable than that <q direct="unspecified">those who have engrossed the riches of the nation should have the management of its public treasure, and the direction of its fleets and armies.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>In a word, the old <name>English</name> aristocracy was compelled to respect the innovating element imbodied in the moneyed interest.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Still more revolutionary was the political theory developed by the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The old idea of a Christian monarchy resting on the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> was exploded, and political power sought its origin in compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Absolute monarchy was denied to be a form<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/><persName n="Hallam,,,,," id="n0328.0001.00009.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hallam,nomatch:0"><surname>Hallam</surname></persName>, <num value="4">IV</num>. <num value="374">374</num>.</note> of civil government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Nothing, it was held, can bind freemen to obey any government save their own agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Political power is a trust; and a breach of the trust dissolves the obligation to allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The supreme power is the legislature, to whose guardianship it has been sacredly and unalterably delegated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>By the fundamental law of property, no taxes may be levied on the people but by its own <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> consent, or that of its authorized agents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>These were<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Chap. <num value="19">XIX</num>.}</note> the doctrines of the revolution, dangerous to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> institutions, and dear to the colonies; menacing the Old World with convulsive struggles and reforms, and establishing for <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> the sanctity of its own legislative bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Throughout the <rs>English</rs> world, the right to representation could never again be separated from the power of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The theory gave to vested rights in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> a bulwark against the monarch; it encouraged the colonists to assert their privileges, as possessing a sanctity which tyranny only could disregard, and which could perish only by destroying allegiance itself.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>But the revolution is still further marked as a consequence of public opinion, effected without bloodshed in favor of the strongest conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Far from being a result of force, it refused to confirm itself by force, and would not tolerate standing armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It even compelled <persName><foreName>William</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>to dismiss his <placeName reg="Nederland, Europe, " key="tgn,7016845">Dutch</placeName> guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>A free discussion of the national policy and its agents was more and more demanded and permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The <name>English</name> government, which used to punish censure of its measures or its ministers with merciless severity, began to lean on public conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3554"/>As, in early days, books were written in unbroken lines, without any division of the parts of a sentence, so the savage, in his speech, runs word into word, till at last a single <num value="1">one</num> appears to include the whole proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3555"/>By this process of aggregation, a simple root is often buried beneath its environments; rapidity of movement and grace are lost; and speech is encumbered with the expressive masses which it has heaped together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3556"/>The words that enter into the compound are not melted into each other; nothing resembling a chemical affinity takes place; but the compound word is like patchwork; the masses that are joined together remain heterogeneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3557"/>The union resembles clumsy mechanism, where the contrivance lies bare, and forces itself upon the eye. The cultivated man, with select instruments, expresses every idea; the savage is forever coining words; and the original character of his language permits him to multiply them at will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3558"/>Still more is the character of synthesis observable in the pronoun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3559"/>That part of speech hardly existed in a separated form&mdash;at least, in a separate form, was rarely in use. Its principal office, in the <name>Algonquin</name> dialects, is to define the relations of the noun and the <pb id="p.260" n="260"/> verb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3560"/>The pronoun knows no distinction of genders<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3561"/>Chap. <num value="22">XXII</num>.}</note> for male and female; <num value="1">one</num> form is common to both; another form is for the neuter, as in Latin there is sometimes a common gender, in contradistinction to the neuter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3562"/>Hence, as nouns are always used in connection with pronouns, there is in the form no distinction between masculine and feminine, but only between the form common to both genders, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the form applied to the neuter, on the other,&mdash;in a word, between the animate and the inanimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3563"/>The plural of animate nouns appears to be formed by an amalgamation with the pronoun of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> person, and the plural of inanimate words by an amalgamation with the corresponding neuter pronoun.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3564"/>The use of the pronoun is, therefore, to modify nouns and verbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3565"/>The ideas which we imply by case, with the exception of the possessive, are not ideas having relation to pronouns: the <rs>Indian</rs> languages have, therefore, all the modifications of the noun that can come from the use of pronouns: but, with the exception of the genitive, as expressing possession, and<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3566"/>Zeisherger's Gram <num value="99">99</num>.</note> marked, as in the <name>Hebrew</name>, by a pronominal affix, they have no series of cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3567"/>The relations of case are expressed by means of pronouns affixed to the verb.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3568"/>The use of the adjective is in a still greater degree synthetical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3569"/>There is no such separate word, in an Algonquin dialect, as a simple adjective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3570"/>As the noun is used only in its relation, so the adjective is used with reference to that which it qualifies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3571"/>Its form, when it stands alone, is that of an impersonal verb.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3572"/>But the peculiar economy of the <rs>American</rs> languages is best illustrated in their verbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3573"/>Though destitute of the substantive verb, of which feeble and uncertain tracts only can be found in the <rs>Chippewa</rs>, and <pb id="p.261" n="261"/> perhaps in the <name>Muskhogee</name>, and those only after the<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3574"/>Chap. <num value="22">XXII</num>.}</note> presence of Europeans,&mdash;yet the verb is the dominant part of speech, swallowing up, as it were, and including within itself, the pronoun, the substantive, and the adjective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3575"/>Declension, cases, articles, are deficient; but every thing is conjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3576"/>The adjective assumes a verbal termination, and is conjugated as a verb; the idea expressed by a noun is clothed in verbal forms, and at once does the office of a verb.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3577"/>Here, also, the synthetic character predominates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3578"/>Does an adjective assume a verbal form, it takes to itself also the person or thing which it qualifies; and the adjective, the pronoun representing the subject, and the verbal form, are included in <num value="1">one</num> word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3579"/>Thus far the <rs>American</rs> dialects have analogies with the <name>Greek</name> and Latin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3580"/>But the <rs>American</rs> go farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3581"/>The accessory idea of case is represented in a form of the verb by means of a pronominal affix.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3582"/>An Algonquin cannot say <hi rend="italics">I love</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">I hate;</hi> he must also, and simultaneously, express the object of the love or hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3583"/>As each noun is blended with a pronominal prefix; as each adjective amalgamates with the subject which it qualifies; so each active verb includes in <num value="1">one</num> and the same word <num value="1">one</num> pronoun representing its subject, and another representing its object also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3584"/>Nor does the synthetic tendency stop here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3585"/>An adjective may <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be melted into the substantive, and the compound word may then assume verbal forms, and thus receive all the changes, and include within itself all the relations, which those forms can express.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3588"/>The verbs have true grammatical forms, as fixed and as regular as those of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> or Sanscrit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3590"/>Chap. <num value="22">XXII</num>.}</note> and the object, are included in the verb by means of significant pronominal syllables, which are prefixed, inserted, or annexed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3591"/>The relations of time are expressed by the insertion, in part, of unmeaning, in part, it may be, of significant, syllables; and, as many supplementary syllables may not always be easily piled <num value="1">one</num> upon another, changes of consonants, as well as, in a slight degree, changes of vowels, and elisions, take place; and sometimes, also, unmeaning syllables are inserted for the sake of euphony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3592"/>Inflection, agglutination, and euphonic changes, all take place in the conjugation of the <rs>Chippewa</rs> verb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3593"/>Of varieties of terminations and forms, the oldest languages, and those in the earliest stage of development, have the most.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3594"/>But not only does the <name>Algonquin</name> verb admit the number of forms required for the diversity of time and mode; it also has numerous conjugations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3595"/>An action may be often repeated, and a frequentative conjugation follows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3596"/>The idea of causation, which the <rs>Indian</rs> does not conceive abstractly, and can express only synthetically, makes a demand, as in the <name>Hebrew</name>, for a new conjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3597"/>Every verb may be used negatively, as well as positively; it may include in itself an animate object, or the object may be inanimate; and whether it expresses a simple action, or, again, is a frequentative, it may have a reflex signification, like the middle voice of a Greek verb; and every <num value="1">one</num> of these accidents gives birth to an entire series of new forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3598"/>Then, since the <rs>Indian</rs> verb includes within itself the agent and the object, it may pass through as many transitions as the persons and numbers of the pronouns will admit of different combinations; and each of these combinations may be used positively or negatively, <pb id="p.263" n="263"/> with a reflex or a causative signification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3599"/>In this<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3600"/>Chap. <num value="22">XXII</num>.}</note> manner, changes are so multiplied, that the number of possible forms of a Chippewa verb is said to amount to <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num>: in other words, the number of possible variations is indefinite.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3601"/>Such are the cumbersome processes by which synthetical languages express thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3602"/>For the want of analysis, the savage obtains no mastery over the forms of his language; nay, the forms themselves are used in a manner which to us would seem anomalous, and to the <rs>Indian</rs> can appear regular only because his mind receives the complex thought without analysis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5117"/>Loving truth, without prejudice and without bias, he discerned intuitively the identity of the laws of nature with those of which humanity is conscious; so that his mind was like a mirror, in which the universe, as it reflected itself, revealed her laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5202"/>The act of parliament produced no revenue, and appeared to be no more than a regulation of commerce, a new development of the colonial system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5203"/>The enactment had its motive in the desire to confirm the monopoly of the <rs>British</rs> sugar plantations, and, so long as it brought no income to the crown, it was complained of as a grievance, but not resisted as a tax.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5205"/>The commercial dependence on the metropolis kept the colonies in debt to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the indebtment increased as the mercantile system was rigidly enforced.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5206"/>It is the nature of a new country to desire credit,&mdash; to submit even to extortion and expedients, rather than renounce its use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5207"/>The condition of a young country, soliciting labor, but not yet enriched by the results of labor; the impediments to progress consequent on colonial dependence; the influence of men of business on legislation,&mdash;combined to bring about extraordinary results, which nothing but the simplicity of colonial <pb id="p.387" n="387"/> life, and purity of colonial morals, could have rendered<note anchored="yes" type="sum" place="marg">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5209"/>The constant state of debt to the mother country created a demand for remittances; so that specie disappeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5210"/>America was left without a currency: she was incapable of the voluntary self-denial requisite to recover a specie currency from commerce with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; could adopt no counteracting policy; and was debarred from such traffic as would have furnished a supply from other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5211"/>The consequence was, a policy which the history of the world had never yet witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5212"/>The progress of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> civilization had endowed commerce with legislative power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5213"/>Its counsels prevailed in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 31" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where it dictated the national policy, prescribed alliances, and menaced wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5214"/>In <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, the political influence of commerce sprung, not from progress, but from sympathy with the movement of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; and it was, less gloriously, content with introducing new maxims of legislation and new systems of finance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5215"/>That it is the duty of government to provide a currency for commerce, was the maxim that came into vogue in every colony but <num value="1">one</num>; and, as the impossibility of maintaining a metallic currency, in a state of colonial dependence, was assumed as undeniable, the maxim, reduced to practice, led to the perilous use of paper money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5216"/>The provinces were invited to manufacture bills of credit, and to institute loan offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5217"/>The credit of the colonies was invoked in behalf of borrowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5218"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> emissions of provincial paper had their origin in the immediate necessities of government.

<p>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effects of the unreal enlargement of the currency appeared beneficial; and men rejoiced in the seeming impulse given to trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5239"/>It was presently found that specie was repelled from the country by the system; that the paper furnished but a depreciated currency, fluctuating in value with every new emission; that, from the interest of debtors, there was between the colonies some rivalship in issues; that the increase of paper, far from remedying the scarcity of money, excited a thirst for new issues; that, as the party of debtors, if it prevailed in the legislature but once in <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, could flood the country with bills of credit, men had an interest to remain in debt; that the income of widows and orphans, and all who had salaries or annuities, was ruinously affected by the fluctuations; that administrators were tempted to delay settlements of estates, as each year diminished the value of the inheritances which were to be paid; and, finally, that commerce was corrupted in its sources by the uncertainty attending the expressions of value in every contract.</p>
