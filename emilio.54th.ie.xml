<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Dear sir,&mdash;As you may have seen by the newspapers, I am about to raise a colored regiment in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This I cannot but regard as perhaps the most important corps to be organized during the whole war, in view of what must be the composition of our new levies; and therefore I am very anxious to organize it judiciously, in order that it may be a model for all future colored regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I am desirous to have for its officers &mdash;particularly for its field-officers&mdash;young men of military experience, of firm antislavery principles, ambitious, superior to a vulgar contempt for color, and having faith in the capacity of colored men for military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Such officers must necessarily be gentlemen of the highest tone and honor; and I shall look for them in those circles of educated antislavery society which, next to the colored race itself, have the greatest interest in this experiment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Reviewing the young men of the character I have described, now in the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> service, it occurs to me to offer the colonelcy to your son, <persName n="Shaw,Captain,,,," id="n0151.0001.00003.00010" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Francis,G.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MAInfantry">Second Massachusetts Infantry</orgName>, and the lieutenant-colonelcy to <persName n="Hallowell,Captain,,,," id="n0151.0001.00003.00011" reg="nearbymention:Hallowell,Morris,L.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hallowell</surname></persName> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="20MAInfantry">Twentieth Massachusetts Infantry</orgName>, the son of <persName n="Hallowell,Mister,Morris,L.,," id="n0151.0001.00003.00012" reg="default:Hallowell,Morris,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Morris</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Hallowell</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>With my deep conviction of the importance of this undertaking, in view of the fact that it will be the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Regiment">first colored regiment</orgName> to be raised in the free States, and that its success or its failure will go far to elevate or depress the estimation in which the character of the colored <rs>Americans</rs> will be held throughout the world, the command of such a regiment seems to me to be a high object of ambition for any officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>How much your son may have reflected upon such a subject I do not know, nor have I any information of his disposition for such a task except what I <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> have derived from his <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName> and reputation; nor should I wish him to undertake it unless he could enter upon it with a full sense of its importance, with an earnest determination for its success, and with the assent and sympathy and support of the opinions of his immediate family.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I therefore enclose you the letter in which I make him the offer of this commission; and I will be obliged to you if you will forward it to him, accompanying it with any expression to him of your own views, and if you will also write to me upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>My mind is drawn towards <persName n="Shaw,Captain,,,," id="n0151.0001.00004.00013" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Francis,G.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName> by many considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I am sure he would attract the support, sympathy, and active co-operation of many among his immediate family relatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The more ardent, faithful, and true Republicans and friends of liberty would recognize in him a scion from a tree whose fruit and leaves have always contributed to the strength and healing of our generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>So it is with <persName n="Hallowell,Captain,,,," id="n0151.0001.00004.00014" reg="nearbymention:Hallowell,Morris,L.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hallowell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Both field officers were dismounted; the band and musicians acted as stretcher-bearers.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>To many a gallant man these scenes upon the sands were the last of earth; to the survivors they will be ever present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>Away over the sea to the eastward the heavy sea-fog was gathering, the western sky bright with the reflected light, for the sun had set. Far away thunder mingled with the occasional boom of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>The gathering host all about, the silent lines stretching away to the rear, the passing of a horseman now and then carrying <pb id="p.76" n="76"/> orders,&mdash;all was ominous of the impending onslaught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Far and indistinct in front was the now silent earthwork, seamed, scarred, and ploughed with shot, its flag still waving in defiance.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>Among the dark soldiers who were to lead veteran regiments which were equal in drill and discipline to any in the country, there was a lack of their usual lightheartedness, for they realized, partially at least, the dangers they were to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/>But there was little nervousness and no depression observable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>It took but a touch to bring out their irrepressible spirit and humor in the old way.

<p>Naturally the officers' thoughts were largely regarding their men. Soon they would know whether the lessons they had taught of soldierly duty would bear good fruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Would they have cause for exultation or be compelled to sheathe their swords, rather than lead cowards?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>He was clad in a close-fitting staff-officer's jacket, with a silver eagle denoting his rank on each shoulder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/>His trousers were light blue; a fine narrow silk sash was wound round his waist beneath the jacket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Upon his head was a high felt army hat with cord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>Depending from his sword-belt was a field-officer's sword of <name>English</name> manufacture, with the initials of his name worked <pb id="p.78" n="78"/> into the ornamentation of the guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>On his hand was an antique gem set in a ring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>In his pocket was a gold watch, marked with his name, attached to a gold chain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Although he had given certain papers and letters to his friend, <persName n="Pierce,Mister,,,," id="n0151.0005.00078.00556" reg="nearbymention:Pierce,Edward,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, he retained his pocket-book, which doubtless contained papers which would establish his identity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>His manner, generally reserved before his men, seemed to unbend to them, for he spoke as he had never done before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>He said, <q direct="unspecified">Now I want you to prove yourselves men,</q> and reminded them that the eyes of <num value="1000">thousands</num> would look upon the night's work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>His bearing was composed and graceful; his cheek had somewhat paled; and the slight twitching of the corners of his mouth plainly showed that the whole cost was counted, and his expressed determination to take the fort or die was to be carried out.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>Meanwhile the twilight deepened, as the minutes, drawn out by waiting, passed, before the signal was given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Officers had silently grasped <num value="1">one</num> another's hands, brought their revolvers round to the front, and tightened their sword-belts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>The men whispered last injunctions to comrades, and listened for the word of command.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The preparations usual in an assault were not made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>There was no provision for cutting away obstructions, filling the ditch, or spiking the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>No special instructions were given the stormers; no line of skirmishers or covering party was thrown out; no engineers or guides accompanied the column; no artillery-men to serve captured guns; no plan of the work was shown company officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>It was understood that the fort would be assaulted with the bayonet, and that the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> would be closely supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/><pb id="p.79" n="79"/></p> 
<p>While on the sands a few cannon-shots had reached the regiment, <num value="1">one</num> passing between the wings, another over to the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>the men sprang to their feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>Then came the admonition, <q direct="unspecified">Move in quick time until within a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the fort; then double quick, and charge!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>A slight pause, followed by the sharp command, <q direct="unspecified">Forward!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>and the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> advanced to the storming.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>There had been a partial resumption of the bombardment during the formation, but now only an occasional shot was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/>The enemy in <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Wagner</placeName> had seen the preparations, knew what was coming, and were awaiting the blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/>With <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n0151.0005.00079.00558" reg="nearbymention:Shaw,Robert,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName> leading, sword in hand, the long advance over <num value="3">three</num> quarters of a mile of sand had begun, with wings closed up and company officers admonishing their men to preserve the alignment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/>Guns from <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName>, and <placeName reg="James Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2418933">James Island</placeName>, began to play upon the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>It was about <time value="7:45pm">7.45 P. M.</time>, with darkness coming on rapidly, when the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>With barely room for the formation from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the narrowing way between the sand hillocks and the sea soon caused a strong pressure to the right, so that <persName n="Willard,Captain,,,," id="n0151.0005.00079.00559" reg="nearbymention:Willard,S.,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Willard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Emilio,Captain,,,," id="n0151.0005.00079.00560" reg="nearbymention:Emilio,Luis,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Emilio</surname></persName> on the right of the right companies of their wings were with some of their men forced to march in water up to their knees, at each incoming of the sea.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Moving at quick time, and preserving its formation as well as the difficult ground and narrowing way permitted, the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> was approaching the defile made by the easterly sweep of the marsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Darkness was rapidly coming <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> on, and each moment became deeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Soon men on the flanks were compelled to fall behind, for want of room to continue in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>The centre only had a free path, and with eyes strained upon the colonel and the flag, they pressed on toward the work, now only <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> away.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>At that moment <persName n="Wagner,,,,," id="n0151.0005.00080.00561" reg="nearbymention:Wagner,Thomas,M.,,"><surname>Wagner</surname></persName> became a mound of fire, from which poured a stream of shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Just a brief lull, and the deafening explosions of cannon were renewed, mingled with the crash, and rattle of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>A sheet of flame, followed by a running fire, like electric sparks, swept along the parapet, as the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC51">Fifty-first North Carolina</orgName> gave a direct, and the <orgName n="Charleston Battalion" type="battalion">Charleston Battalion</orgName> a left-oblique, fire on the <num type="ordinal" value="54">Fifty-fourth</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Their <orgName type="regiment" key="NC31">Thirty-first North Carolina</orgName> had lost heart, and failed to take position in the southeast bastion,&mdash;fortunately, too, for had its musketry fire been added to that delivered, it is doubtful whether any Federal troops could have passed the defile.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>When this tempest of war came, before which men fell in numbers on every side, the only response the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> made to the deadly challenge was to change step to the double-quick, that it might the sooner close with the foe. There had been no stop, pause, or check at any period of the advance, nor was there now. As the swifter pace was taken, and officers sprang to the fore with waving swords barely seen in the darkness, the men closed the gaps, and with set jaws, panting breath, and bowed heads, charged on.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/><placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 107" reg="morris island, charleston, south carolina">Wagner</placeName>'s wall, momentarily lit up by cannon-flashes, was still the goal toward which the survivors rushed in sadly diminished numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>It was now dark, the gloom made more intense by the blinding explosions in the <pb id="p.81" n="81"/> front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>This terrible fire which the regiment had just faced, probably caused the greatest number of casualties sustained by the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> in the assault; for nearer the work the men were somewhat sheltered by the high parapet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>Every flash showed the ground dotted with men of the regiment, killed or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>Great holes, made by the huge shells of the navy or the land batteries, were pitfalls into which the men stumbled or fell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>From that salient no musketry fire came; and some <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num> men <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered it, not following the main body by reason of the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>As the survivors drew near the work, they encountered the flanking fire delivered from guns in the southwest salient, and the howitzers outside the fort, which swept the trench, where further severe losses were sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>Nothing but the ditch now separated the stormers and the foe. Down into this they went, through the <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> of water therein, and mounted the slope beyond in the teeth of the enemy, some of whom, standing on the crest, fired down on them with depressed pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Both flags were planted on the parapet, the national flag carried there and gallantly maintained by the brave <persName n="Carney,Sergeant,William,H.,," id="n0151.0005.00081.00563" reg="default:Carney,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergt.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Carney</surname></persName> of <orgName type="company" n="Company C">Company C</orgName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>As the crest was gained, the crack of revolvershots was heard, for the officers fired into the surging mass of upturned faces confronting them, lit up redly but a moment by the powder-flashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>Musket-butts and bayonets were freely used on the parapet, where the stormers were gallantly met. The garrison fought with muskets, handspikes, and gun-rammers, the officers striking with their swords, so close were the combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>Numbers, however, soon told against the <num value="54" type="ordinal">Fifty-fourth</num>, for it was tens against hundreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Outlined against the sky, they were a fair mark for the foe. Men fell every moment during the brief struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Some of the wounded crawled down the slope to shelter; others fell headlong into the ditch below.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6547"/>The governor himself was true to Southern principles . . . ; but this friend to the oppressed remained firm to the cause of his country. ... He came to them and offered to plead their cause before the sham tribunal that was to decide their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6549"/>But he persisted, and gave them money to purchase little necessities (for nothing but cornmeal was issued to them, and this in very small quantities), and left them with the promise that he would soon return and report the progress of his investigations; but when he came he found them still doubting and unwilling to place confidence in him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6550"/>But at the commencement of this intestine strife, having proved true to the old flag, his property had been swept from him, calling him traitor and an abolitionist, and that now he was an outcast among his friends, and in constant danger of being assassinated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6551"/>He also told them that he knew that this must be his fate from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, if he remained true to his convictions; but that having counted the cost, it was as nothing when weighed in the balance against truth, and he was now prepared to do his work thoroughly and unhesitatingly, regarding only as friends those who were true to the cause of their country.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6552"/>By this means he gained their confidence, for there is a higher language than the written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6553"/>It is seen in the mute dropping of the tear, etc. . . .

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6582"/>sir,&mdash;I have to acknowledge your letter of the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="23">23d instant</day></dateStruct>, relative to the disposition of negroes captured in arms from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6583"/><pb id="p.410" n="410"/></p> 
<p>The embarrassments attending this question, and the serious consequences which might ensue from the rigid enforcement of the act of Congress passed on the subject, have co-operated with the objections which have been made by the authorities of some of the <name>States</name> to receive negroes directed to be turned over to them, and with the inability, when they have been turned over, to obtain criminal trials, to induce the department to assume the responsibility of modifying the proposed action in relation to such negroes.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6584"/>It has been considered best, in view of the whole subject, to make a distinction between negroes so taken who can be recognized or identified as slaves, and those who were free inhabitants of the <rs>Federal States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6585"/>The former are regarded and treated as recaptured slaves, under the provisions of the act approved <dateStruct value="1862-10-13"><month reg="10">October</month> <day reg="13">13</day>, <year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, which makes arrangement for their return to the owners establishing title.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6586"/>This, it will be observed, will not free them from the liability to criminal proceedings in the hands of owners, if it be deemed necessary for the vindication of the criminal justice of the <name>States</name> to which they belong, while at the same time it recognizes and secures the property of the owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6587"/>The free negroes of the <rs>North</rs> are held in strict confinement, not as yet formally recognized in any official dealing with the enemy as prisoners-of-war, but, except in some trivial particulars indicative of inferior consideration, are treated very much in the same manner as our other captives.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6588"/>The decision as to their ultimate disposition will probably be referred to Congress, and, as far as I can judge from the prevalent opinion which has reached me, it is probable they will be recognized in some form as prisoners-of-war.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6589"/>In relation to the negroes received by you, I would advise the delivery to their owners of such as are identified as slaves, and the return of those discovered to have been originally free to the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities.</p>
