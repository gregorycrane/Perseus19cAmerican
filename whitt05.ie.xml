<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>I remember I did promise my kind <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Oliver</foreName></persName> (whom I pray <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to have always ill his keeping), when I parted with him nigh unto <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> ago, at mine <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Grindall</foreName></persName>'s, that, on coming to this new country, I would, for his sake and perusal, keep a little journal of whatsoever did happen both unto myself and unto those with whom I might sojourn; as also, some account of the country and its marvels, and mine own cogitations thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>So I this day make a beginning of the same; albeit, as my cousin well knoweth, not from any vanity of authorship, or because of any undue confiding in my poor ability to edify <num value="1">one</num> justly held in repute among the learned, but because my heart tells me that what I write, be it ever so faulty, will be read by the partial eye of my kinsman, and not with the critical observance of the scholar, and that his love will not find it difficult to excuse what offends his clerkly judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>And, to embolden me withal, I will never forget that I am writing for mine old playmate at hide-and-seek in the farm-house at <placeName key="tgn,2095983" n="1.000 1" reg="hilton, richland, south carolina">Hilton</placeName>,&mdash;the same who used to hunt after flowers for me in the <pb id="p.10" n="10"/> spring, and who did fill my apron with hazel-nuts in the autumn, and who was then, I fear, little wiser than his still foolish cousin, who, if she hath not since learned so many new things as himself, hath perhaps remembered more of the old. Therefore, without other preface, I will begin my record</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Of my voyage out I need not write, as I have spoken of it in my letters already, and it greatly irks me to think of it. Oh, a very long, dismal time of sickness and great discomforts, and many sad thoughts of all I had left behind, and fears of all I was going to meet in the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>I can liken it only to an ugly dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>When we got at last to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, the sight of the land and trees, albeit they were exceeding bleak and bare (it being a late season, and nipping cold), was like unto a vision of a better world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As we passed the small wooded islands, which make the bay very pleasant, and entered close upon the town, and saw the houses, and orchards, and meadows, and the hills beyond covered with a great growth of wood, my brother, lifting up both of his hands, cried out, <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">How goodly are thy tents, O <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName>, and thy habitations, O <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName></hi>!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>and for my part I did weep for joy and thankfulness of heart, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> had brought us safely to so fair a haven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><rs type="role2">Uncle</rs> and <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Rawson</foreName></persName> met us on the wharf, and made us very comfortable at their house, which is about half a mile from the water-side, at the foot of a hill, with an oaken forest behind it, to shelter it from the north wind, which is here very piercing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><rs type="role2">Uncle</rs> is <rs type="role" reg="Secretary">Secretary</rs> of the <rs>Massachusetts</rs>, and spends a great part of his time in town; and his <pb id="p.11" n="11"/> wife and family are with him in the winter season, but they spend their summers at his plantation on the <placeName reg="Merrimack River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7021005">Merrimac River</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Newbury, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014219">Newbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>His daughter, <persName><foreName>Rebecca</foreName></persName>, is just about my age, very tall and ladylooking; she is like her <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName>, who was at <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Hilton</foreName></persName>'s last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>She hath, moreover, a pleasant wit, and hath seen much goodly company, being greatly admired by the young men of family and distinction in the <name>Province</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>She hath been very kind to me, telling me that she looked upon me as a sister.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I have been courteously entertained, moreover, by many of the principal people, both of the reverend clergy and the magistracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Nor must I forbear to mention a visit which I paid with <rs type="role2">Uncle</rs> and <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Rawson</foreName></persName> at the house of an aged magistrate of high esteem and influence in these parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He saluted me courteously, and made inquiries concerning our family, and whether I had been admitted into the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>On my telling him that I had not, he knit his brows, and looked at me very sternly.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Poor <rs type="role2">Madam</rs> is a quiet, sickly-looking woman, and seems not a little in awe of her husband, <pb id="p.12" n="12"/> at the which I do not marvel, for he hath a very impatient, forbidding way with him, and, I must say, seemed to carry himself harshly at times towards her. <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Rawson</foreName></persName> says he has had much to try his temper; that there have been many and sore difficulties in Church as well as State; and he hath bitter enemies, in some of the members of the <orgName n="General Court" type="misc">General Court</orgName>, who count him too severe with the <name>Quakers</name> and other disturbers and ranters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I told him it was no doubt true; but that I thought it a bad use of the <rs>Lord</rs>'s chastenings to abuse <num value="1">one</num>'s best friends for the wrongs done by enemies; and, that to be made to atone for what went ill in Church or State, was a kind of vicarious suffering that, if I was in <rs type="role2">Madam</rs>'s place, I should not bear with half her patience and sweetness.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We set out day before yesterday on our journey to <placeName reg="Newbury, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014219">Newbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There were <num value="8">eight</num> of us,&mdash;<persName n="Rawson,,Rebecca,,," id="n0316.0003.00012.00004" reg="default:Rawson,Rebecca,,,"><foreName>Rebecca</foreName> <surname>Rawson</surname></persName> and her sister, <persName n="Broughton,,Thomas,,," id="n0316.0003.00012.00005" reg="default:Broughton,Thomas,,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Broughton</surname></persName>, his wife, and their man-servant, my <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Leonard</foreName></persName> and myself, and young <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Newbury, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014219">Newbury</placeName>, who had been to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> on business, his father having great fisheries in the river as well as the sea. He is, I can perceive, a great admirer of my cousin, and indeed not without reason; for she hath in mind and person, in her graceful carriage and pleasant discourse, and a certain not unpleasing waywardness, as of a merry child, that which makes her company sought of all. Our route the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day lay through the woods and along the borders <pb id="p.13" n="13"/> of great marshes and meadows on the seas shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We came to <persName n="Linne,,,,," id="n0316.0003.00013.00006" reg="mostcommon:Linne,nomatch:0"><surname>Linne</surname></persName> at night, and stopped at the house of a kinsman of <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName>'s,&mdash;a man of some substance and note in that settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We were tired and hungry, and the supper of warm <name>Indian</name> bread and sweet milk relished quite as well as any I ever ate in the Old Country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The next day we went on over a rough road to <placeName key="tgn,2050864" n="1.000 8" reg="wenham, essex county, massachusetts">Wenham</placeName>, through <placeName reg="Salem, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014447">Salem</placeName>, which is quite a pleasant town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Here we stopped until this morning, when we again mounted our horses, and reached this place, after a smart ride of <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>. The weather in the morning was warm and soft as our summer days at home; and, as we rode through the woods, where the young leaves were fluttering, and the white blossoms of the wind-flowers, and the blue violets and the yellow blooming of the cowslips in the low grounds, were seen on either hand, and the birds all the time making a great and pleasing melody in the branches, I was glad of heart as a child, and thought if my beloved friends and <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Oliver</foreName></persName> were only with us, I could never wish to leave so fair a country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Just before we reached <placeName key="tgn,2049310" n="1.000 3" reg="agawam, hampden county, massachusetts">Agawam</placeName>, as I was riding a little before my companions, I was startled greatly by the sight of an Indian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was standing close to the bridle-path, his half-naked body partly hidden by a clump of white birches, through which he looked out on me with eyes like <num value="2">two</num> live coals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I cried for my brother and turned my horse, when <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName> came up and bid me be of cheer, for he knew the savage, and that he was friendly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Whereupon, he bade him come out of <pb id="p.14" n="14"/> the bushes, which he did, after a little parley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He was a tall man, of very fair and comely make, and wore a red woollen blanket with beads and small clam-shells jingling about it. His skin was swarthy, not black like a Moor or Guinea-man, but of a color not unlike that of tarnished copper coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He spake but little, and that in his own tongue, very harsh and strange-sounding to my ear. <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName> tells me that he is <rs type="role" reg="Chief">Chief</rs> of the <name>Agawams</name>, once a great nation in these parts, but now quite small and broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>As we rode on, and from the top of a hill got a fair view of the great sea off at the east, <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName> bade me notice a little bay, around which I could see <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> small, peaked huts or tents, standing just where the white sands of the beach met the green line of grass and bushes of the uplands.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><q direct="unspecified">There,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">are their summer-houses, which they build near unto their fishing-grounds and corn-fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In the winter they go far back into the wilderness, where game is plenty of all kinds, and there build their wigwams in warm valleys thick with trees, which do serve to shelter them from the winds.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/></p> 
<p><q direct="unspecified">Let us look into them,</q> said I to <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Rebecca</foreName></persName>; <q direct="unspecified">it seems but a stone's throw from our way.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/></p> 
<p>She tried to dissuade me, by calling them a dirty, foul people; but seeing I was not to be put off, she at last consented, and we rode aside down the hill, the rest following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>On our way we had the misfortune to ride over their corn-field; at the which, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> women and as many boys set <pb id="p.15" n="15"/> up a yell very hideous to hear; whereat <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName> came up, and appeased them by giving them some money and a drink of <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName> spirits, with which they seemed vastly pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I looked into <num value="1">one</num> of their huts; it was made of poles like unto a tent, only it was covered with the silver-colored bark of the birch, instead of hempen stuff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>A bark mat, braided of many exceeding brilliant colors, covered a goodly part of the space inside; and from the poles we saw fishes hanging, and strips of dried meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>On a pile of skins in the corner sat a young woman with a child a-nursing; they both looked sadly wild and neglected; yet had she withal a pleasant face, and as she bent over her little <num value="1">one</num>, her long, straight, and black hair falling over him, and murmuring a low and very plaintive melody, I forgot everything save that she was a woman and a mother, and I felt my heart greatly drawn towards her. So, giving my horse in charge, I ventured in to her, speaking as kindly as I could, and asking to see her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>She understood me, and with a smile held up her little <hi rend="italics">papoose</hi>, as she called him,&mdash;who, to say truth, I could not call very pretty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He seemed to have a wild, shy look, like the offspring of an untamed animal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The woman wore a blanket, gaudily fringed, and she had a string of beads on her neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>She took down a basket, woven of <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs> willows, and pressed me to taste of her bread; which I did, that I might not offend her courtesy by refusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was not of ill taste, although so hard <num value="1">one</num> could scarcely bite it, and was made of <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> unleavened, mixed with a dried berry, which gives it <pb id="p.16" n="16"/> a sweet flavor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>She told me, in her broken way, that the whole tribe now numbered only twentyfive men and women, counting out the number very fast with yellow grains of corn, on the corner of her blanket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>She was, she said, the youngest woman in the tribe; and her husband, Peckanaminet, was the <rs>Indian</rs> we had met in the bridles path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I gave her a pretty piece of ribbon, and an apron for the child; and she thanked me in her manner, going with us on our return to the path; and when I had ridden a little onward, I saw her husband running towards us; so, stopping my horse, I awaited until he came up, when he offered me a fine large fish, which he had just caught, in acknowledgment, as I judged, of my gift to his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><persName><foreName>Rebecca</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Broughton,Mistress,,,," id="n0316.0003.00016.00007" reg="nearbymention:Broughton,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Mistress">Mistress</roleName> <surname>Broughton</surname></persName> laughed, mad bid him take the thing away; but I would not suffer it, and so <placeName reg="Robert Pike">Robert Pike</placeName> took it, and brought it on to our present tarrying place, where truly it hath made a fair supper for us all. These poor heathen people seem not so exceeding bad as they have been reported; they be like unto ourselves, only lacking our knowledge and opportunities, which, indeed, are not our own to boast of, but gifts of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, calling for humble thankfulness, and daily prayer and watchfulness, that they be rightly improved.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He saluted <pb id="p.17" n="17"/> us with much ease and courtliness, offering especial compliments to <persName><foreName>Rebecca</foreName></persName>, to whom he seemed well known, and who I thought was both glad and surprised at his coining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>As I rode near, she said it gave her great joy to bring to each other's acquaintance, <persName n="Hale,Sir,Thomas,,," id="n0316.0003.00017.00008" reg="default:Hale,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName>, a good friend of her father's, and her <persName><roleName n="Cousin">cousin</roleName> <foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, who, like himself, was a new-comer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He replied, that he should look with favor on any <num value="1">one</num> who was near to her in friendship or kindred; and, on learning my father's name, said he had seen him at his uncle's, <persName n="Hale,Sir,Matthew,,," id="n0316.0003.00017.00009" reg="default:Hale,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Matthew</foreName> <surname>Hale</surname></persName>'s, many years ago, and could vouch for him as a worthy man. After some pleasant and merry discoursing with us, he and my brother fell into converse upon the state of affairs in the <name>Colony</name>, the late lamentable war with the <rs>Narragansett</rs> and <persName n="Indians,,Pequod,,," id="n0316.0003.00017.00010" reg="default:Indians,Pequod,,,"><foreName>Pequod</foreName> <surname>Indians</surname></persName>, together with the growth of heresy and schism in the churches, which latter he did not scruple to charge upon the wicked policy of the home government in checking the wholesome severity of the laws here enacted against the schemers and ranters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/><q direct="unspecified">I quite agree,</q> said he, <q direct="unspecified">with <persName n="Rawson,Mister,,,," id="n0316.0003.00017.00011" reg="nearbymention:Rawson,Rebecca,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rawson</surname></persName>, that they should have hanged <num value="10">ten</num> where they did <num value="1">one</num>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/><persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Rebecca</foreName></persName> here said she was sure her father was now glad the laws were changed, and that he had often told her that, although the condemned deserved their punishment, he was not sure that it was the best way to put down the heresy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>If she was ruler, she continued, in her merry way, she would send all the schemers and ranters, and all the sour, crabbed, busybodies in the churches, off to <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, where all kinds of folly, in spirituals as <pb id="p.18" n="18"/> well as temporals, were permitted, and <num value="1">one</num> crazy head could not reproach another.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Yesterday a strange thing happened in the meeting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The minister had gone on in his discourse, until the sand in the hour-glass on the rails before the deacons had wellnigh run out, and <persName n="Dole,Deacon,,,," id="n0316.0003.00040.00043" reg="mostcommon:Dole,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Deacon">Deacon</roleName> <surname>Dole</surname></persName> was about turning it, when suddenly I saw the congregation all about me give a great start, and look back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>A young woman, barefooted, and with a coarse canvas frock about her, and her long hair hanging loose like a periwig, and sprinkled with ashes, came walking up the south aisle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Just as she got near <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Rawson</foreName></persName>'s seat she stopped, and turning round towards the <num value="4">four</num> corners of the house, cried out: <q direct="unspecified"><hi rend="italics">Woe to the persectors!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The poor creature stood still and quiet; she was deathly pale, and her wild hair and sackcloth frock gave her a very strange and pitiable look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>My aunt says she did often see him, wandering about among the hills and woods, and along the banks of streams of water, searching for precious ores and stones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>He had even been as far as the great mountains, beyond Pigwackett, climbing to the top thereof, where the snows lie wellnigh all the year, his way thither lying through doleful swamps and lonesome <pb id="p.63" n="63"/> woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>He was a great friend of the <name>Indians</name>, who held him to be a more famous conjurer than their own powahs; and, indeed, he was learned in all curious and occult arts, having studied at the great <placeName reg="College of Padua">College of Padua</placeName>, and travelled in all parts of the old countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>He sometimes stopped in his travels at my uncle's house, the little blackamoor sleeping in the barn, for my aunt feared him, as he was reputed to be a wicked imp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>But as mine uncle would in no wise be so put off, and still pressing him to try his art, he took a bit of coal, and began to make marks on the floor, in a very careless way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>So he set off, and found the cow lying at the foot of a great tree, close beside a brook, she being quite dead, which thing did show that he was a magician of no mean sort.</p>

There was <num value="1">one</num> old man, who, she remembered, did roam about seeking for hidden treasures, until he lost his wits, and might be seen filling a bag with bright stones and shining sand, muttering and laughing to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The cross being such as the <name>Papists</name> do worship, and therefore unlawful, her husband did beat it into a solid wedge privately, and kept it from the knowledge of the minister and the magistrates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>A strange and wonderful providence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Last night there was a great company of the neighbors at my uncle's, to help him in the husking and stripping of the corn, as is the custom in these parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The barn-floor was about half-filled with the corn in its dry leaves; the company sitting down on blocks and stools before it, plucking off the leaves, and throwing the yellow ears into baskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>A pleasant and merry evening we had; and when the corn was nigh stripped, I went into the house with <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Thankful</foreName></persName>, to look to the supper and the laying of the tables, when we heard a loud noise in the barn, and <num value="1">one</num> of the girls came running in, <pb id="p.69" n="69"/> crying out, <q direct="unspecified">O Thankful!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>His spirit is in the barn!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The plates dropt from my cousin's hand, and, with a faint cry, she fell back against the wall for a little space; when, hearing a man's voice without, speaking her name, she ran to the door, with the look of <num value="1">one</num> beside herself; while I, trembling to see her in such a plight, followed her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>By this time, the house was full of people, and among the rest came <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s old mother and his sisters, and we all did weep and laugh at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>That when he did get about again, the savage who lodged him, and who had taken him as a son, in the place of his own, slain <pb id="p.70" n="70"/> by the <name>Mohawks</name>, would not let him go home, although he did confess that the war was at an end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>They are much stained and smoked, and the mice have eaten them sadly, so that I can make little of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>They seem to be letters, and some fragments of what did take place in the life of a young woman of quality from the <rs>North</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>I find frequent mention made of <persName><roleName n="Cousin">Cousin</roleName> <foreName>Christopher</foreName></persName>, who is also spoken of as a soldier in the wars with the <name>Turks</name>, and as a Knight of <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Poorly as I can make out the meaning of these fragments, I have read enough to make my heart sad, for I gather from them that the young woman was in early life betrothed to her cousin, and that afterwards, owing, as I judge, to the authority of her parents, she did part with him, he going abroad, and entering into the wars, in the belief that she was to wed another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>But it seemed that the heart of the young woman did so plead for her cousin, that she could not be brought to marry as her family willed her to do; and, after a lapse of years, she, by chance hearing that <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Christopher</foreName></persName> had gone to the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, where he was acting as an agent <pb id="p.72" n="72"/> of his kinsman, <persName n="Gorges,Sir,Ferdinando,,," id="n0316.0003.00072.00142" reg="default:Gorges,Ferdinando,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Ferdinando</foreName> <surname>Gorges</surname></persName>, in respect to the <rs>Maine Province</rs>, did privately leave her home, and take passage in a Boston bound ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>How she did make herself known to <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Christopher</foreName></persName>, I find no mention made; but, he now being a Knight of the <name>Order</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7013172" n="1.000 13" reg="saint john,new brunswick,canada,north and central america">St. John</placeName> of <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>, and vowed to forego marriage, as is the rule of that Order, and being, moreover, as was thought, a priest or Jesuit, her great love and constancy could meet with but a sorrowful return on his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>It does appear, however, that he journeyed to <placeName reg="Montreal, Ile de Montreal, Quebec" key="tgn,7013051">Montreal</placeName>, to take counsel of some of the great Papist priests there, touching the obtaining of a dispensation from the <rs type="place">Head</rs> of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, so that he might marry the young woman; but, getting no encouragement therein, he went to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to find a passage for her to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>He was there complained of as a Papist; and the coming over of his cousin being moreover known, a great and cruel scandal did arise from it, and he was looked upon as a man of evil life, though I find nothing to warrant such a notion, but much to the contrary thereof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>What became of him and the young woman, his cousin, in the end, I do not learn.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>I could but think how many tears had been shed over this little token, and how often, <pb id="p.73" n="73"/> through long, weary years, it did call to mind the sweet joy of early love, of that fairest blossom of the spring of life of which it was an emblem, alike in its beauty and its speedy withering.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Here, also, through the thick matting of dead leaves, all manner of shrubs and bushes, some of them very sweet and fair in their flowering, and others greatly prized for their healing virtues, do grow up plenteously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>The air was sweet and soft, and there was a clear, but not a hot sun, and the chirping of squirrels, and the noise of birds, and the sound of the waves breaking on the beach a little distance off, and the leaves, at every breath of the wind in the tree-tops, whirling and fluttering <pb id="p.83" n="83"/> down about me, like so many yellow and scarlet-colored birds, made the ride wonderfully pleasant and entertaining.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>He began by saying that mutual benevolence was a law of nature,&mdash;no <num value="1">one</num> being a whole of himself, nor capable of happily subsisting by himself, but rather a member of the great body of mankind, which must dissolve and perish, unless held together and compacted in its various parts by the force of that common and blessed law.

It hath been said by ingenious men, that in the outward world all things do mutually operate upon and affect each other; and that it is by the energy of this principle that our solid earth is supported, and the heavenly bodies are made to keep the rhythmic harmonies of their creation, and dispense upon us their benign favors; and it may be said, that a law akin to this hath been ordained for the moral world,&mdash;mutual benevolence being the cement and support of families, and churches, and states, and of the great community and brotherhood of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>It doth both make and preserve all the peace, and harmony, and beauty, which liken our world in some small degree to heaven, and without it all things would rush into confusion and discord, and the earth would become a place of horror and torment, and men become as ravening wolves, devouring and being devoured by <num value="1">one</num> another.</p>

<p>The minister then spake of the duty of charity towards even the sinful and froward, and of winning them by love and good will, and making even their correction and punishment a means of awakening them to repentance, and the calling forth of the fruits meet for it. He also spake of self-styled prophets and enthusiastic people, who went about to cry against the <rs type="place">Church</rs> and the <rs>State</rs>, and to teach new doctrines, saying that oftentimes such were sent as a judgment upon the professors of the truth, who had the form of godliness only, while lacking the power thereof; and that he did believe that the zeal which had been manifested against such had not always been enough seasoned with charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>It did argue a lack of faith in the truth, to fly into a panic and a great rage when it was called in question; and to undertake to become <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> avengers, and to torture and burn heretics, was an error of the <name>Papists</name>, which ill became those who had gone out from among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Moreover, he did believe that many of these people, who had so troubled the <name>Colony</name> of late, were at heart simple and honest men and women, whose heads might indeed be unsound, but who at heart sought to do the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; and, of a truth, <num value="11">11</num> could testify to the sobriety and strictness of their lives, and the justice of their dealings in outward things.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>He spake also somewhat of the <name>Indians</name>, who, he said, were our brethren, and concerning whom <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> we would have an account to give at the <name>Great Day</name>. The hand of these heathen people had been heavy upon the <name>Colonies</name>, and many had suffered from their cruel slaughterings, and the captivity of themselves and their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Here the aged minister wept, for he doubtless thought of his son, who was slain in the war; and for a time the words did seem to die in his throat, so greatly was he moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>But he went on to say, that since <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, in his great and undeserved mercy, had put an end to the war, all present unkindness and hard dealing towards the poor benighted heathen was an offence in the eyes of Him who respecteth not the persons of men, but who regardeth with an equal eye the white and the red men, both being the workmanship of His hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>It is our blessed privilege to labor to bring them to a knowledge of the true <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, whom, like the <name>Athenians</name>, some of them do ignorantly worship; while the greater part, as was said of the heathen formerly, <hi rend="italics">do not, out of the good things that are seen, know Him that is; neither by considering the works do they acknowledge the workmaster, but deem the fire or wind, or the swift air, or the circle of the stars, or the violent water</hi>, <hi rend="italics">or the lights of heaven, to be the gods who govern the world</hi>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>He counselled against mischief-makers and stirrers up of strife, and such as do desire occasion against their brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>He said that it did seem as if many thought to atone for their own sins by their great heat and zeal to discover wickedness in others; and that he feared such might be the case now, when there was much talk of the outward and <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> visible doings of Satan in this place; whereas, the enemy was most to be feared who did work privily in the heart; it being a small thing for him to bewitch a dwelling made of wood and stone, who did so easily possess and enchant the precious souls of men.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Finally, he did exhort all to keep watch over their own spirits, and to remember that what measure they do mete to others shall be measured to them again; to lay aside all wrath, and malice, and evil-speaking; to bear <num value="1">one</num> another's burdens, and so make this Church in the wilderness beautiful and comely, an example to the world of that peace and good will to men, which the angels sang of at the birth of the blessed Redeemer.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>I once queried with him touching his sorceries, when he said he had done wickedly, and it was a marvel that the <rs>Lord</rs> spared his life, and did not strike him dead with his lightnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>And when I did press him to tell me how he did become a Powah, he said he liked not to speak of it, but would nevertheless tell me. His grandmother used to tell him many things concerning the good and bad spirits, and in a special manner of the <name>Abomako</name>, or Chepian, who had the form of a serpent, and who was the cause of sickness and pain, and of all manner of evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>And it so chanced that on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when hunting in the wilderness, <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> journey from home, he did lose his way, and wandered for a long time without food, and night coming on, he thought he did hear voices of men talking; but, on drawing near to the place whence the noise came, he could see nothing but the trees and rocks; and then he did see a light, as from a wigwam a little way off, but, going towards it, it moved away, and, following it, he was led into a dismal swamp, full of water, and snakes, and briers; and being in so sad a plight, he bethought him of all he had heard of evil demons and of Chepian, who, he doubted not was the cause of his trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>At last, coming to a little knoll in the swamp, he lay down under a hemlock-tree, and being sorely tired, fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>And he dreamed a dream, which was in this wise:&mdash;</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/><q direct="unspecified">He thought he beheld a great snake crawl up out of the marsh, and stand upon his tail under a <pb id="p.139" n="139"/> tall maple-tree; and he thought the snake spake to him, and bade him be of good cheer, for he would guide him safe out of the swamp, and make of him a great chief and Powah, if he would pray to him and own him as his <name n="God" type="God">god</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>All which he did promise to do; and when he awoke in. the morning, he beheld before him the maple-tree under which he had seen the snake in his dream, and, climbing to the top of it, he saw a great distance off the smoke of a wigwam, towards which he went, and found some of his own people cooking a plentiful meal of venison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>When he got back to Patucket, he told his dream to his grandmother, who was greatly rejoiced, and went about from wigwam to wigwam, telling the tribe that Chepian had appeared to her grandson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>So they had a great feast and dance, and he was thenceforth looked upon as a Powah.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Shortly after, a woman of the tribe falling sick, he was sent for to heal her, which he did by praying to Chepian and laying his hands upon her; and at divers other times the <name>Devil</name> helped him in his enchantments and witcheries.</q></p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>He confessed he knew none; which was the more strange, as in <name>Christian</name> countries the Old Serpent did commonly find instruments of his craft among the women.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>To my query as to what notion the heathen had of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and a future state, he said that, when he did discourse them concerning the great and true <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who made all things, and of heaven and hell, they would readily consent thereto, saying that so their fathers had taught them; but when he spake <pb id="p.140" n="140"/> to them of the destruction of the world by fire, and the resurrection of the body, they would not hear to it, for they pretend to hold that the spirit of the dead man goes forthwith, after death, to the happy hunting-grounds made for good <persName n="Indians,,,,," id="n0316.0003.00140.00414" reg="nearbymention:Indians,Christian,,,"><surname>Indians</surname></persName>, or to the cold and dreary swamps and mountains, where the bad <rs>Indians</rs> do starve and freeze, and suffer all manner of hardships.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>This fellow was, moreover, exceeding cunning, and did often ask questions hard to be answered touching the creation of the <name>Devil</name>, and the fall of man.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/>I said to him that I thought it must be a great satisfaction to him to be permitted to witness the fruit of his long labors and sufferings in behalf of these people, in the hopeful conversion of so many of them to the light and knowledge of the <name>Gospel</name>; to which he replied that his poor labors had been indeed greatly blest, but it was all of the <rs>Lord</rs>'s doing, and he could truly say he felt, in view of the great wants of these wild people, and their darkness and misery, that he had by no means done all his duty towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/>He said also, <pb id="p.141" n="141"/> that whenever he was in danger of being puffed up with the praise of men, or the vanity of his own heart, the <rs>Lord</rs> had seen meet to abase and humble him, by the falling back of some of his people to their old heathenish practices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>The war, moreover, was a sore evil to the <rs>Indian</rs> churches, as some few of their number were enticed by <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName> to join him in his burnings and slaughterings, and this did cause even the peaceful and innocent to be vehemently suspected and cried out against as deceivers and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/>Poor, unoffending old men, and pious women, had been shot at and killed by our soldiers, their wigwams burned, their families scattered, and driven to seek shelter with the enemy; yea, many <persName n="Indians,,Christian,,," id="n0316.0003.00141.00417" reg="default:Indians,Christian,,,"><foreName>Christian</foreName> <surname>Indians</surname></persName>, he did believe, had been sold as slaves to the <name>Barbadoes</name>, which he did account a great sin, and a reproach to our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2162"/>No, leave me to myself, or rather to that new existence which I have entered upon, to the strange world to which my daily opiate invites me. In society I am alone, fearfully solitary; for my mind broods gloomily over its besetting sorrow, and I make myself doubly miserable by contrasting my own darkness with the light and joy of all about me; nay, you cannot imagine what a very hard thing it is, at such times, to overcome some savage feelings of misanthropy which will present themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2163"/>But when I am alone, and under the influence of opium, I lose for a season my chief source of misery, myself; my mind takes a new and unnatural channel; and I have often thought that any <num value="1">one</num>, even that of insanity, would be preferable to its natural <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2164"/>It is drawn, as it were, out of itself; and I realize in my own experience the fable of <persName n="Pythagoras,,,,," id="n0316.0004.00281.00761" reg="mostcommon:Pythagoras,nomatch:0"><surname>Pythagoras</surname></persName>, of <num value="2">two</num> distinct existences, enjoyed by the same intellectual being.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2195"/>I look back with wonder and astonishment to that period of my life, when such a being claimed and received the entire devotion of my heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2196"/>Her idea blended with or predominated over all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2197"/>It was the common centre in my mind from which all the radii of thought had their direction; the nucleus around which I had gathered all that my ardent imagination could conceive, or a memory stored with all the delicious dreams of poetry and romances could embody, of female excellence and purity and constancy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2198"/>It is idle to talk of the superior attractions of intellectual beauty, when compared with mere external loveliness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2199"/>The mind, invisible and complicated and indefinite, does not address itself directly to the senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2200"/>It is comprehended only by its similitude in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2201"/>It reveals itself, even then, but slowly and imperfectly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2203"/>The image of substantial and material loveliness once seen leaves an impression as distinct and perfect upon the retina of memory as upon that of the eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2204"/>It does not rise before us in detached and disconnected proportions, like that of spiritual loveliness, but in crowds, and in solitude, and in all the throngful varieties of thought and feeling and action, the symmetrical whole, the beautiful perfection comes up in the vision of memory, and stands, like a bright angel, between us and all other impressions of outward or immaterial beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2205"/><pb id="p.285" n="285"/></p> 
<p>I saw her, and could not forget her; I sought her society, and was gratified with it. It is true, I sometimes (in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stages of my attachment) had my misgivings in relation to her character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2206"/>I sometimes feared that her ideas were too much limited to the perishing beauty of her person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2207"/>But to look upon her graceful figure yielding to the dance, or reclining in its indolent symmetry; to watch the beautiful play of coloring upon her cheek, and the moonlight transit of her smile; to study her faultless features in their delicate and even thoughtful repose, or when lighted up into conversational vivacity, was to forget everything, save the exceeding and bewildering fascination before me. Like the silver veil of Khorassan it shut out from my view the mental deformity beneath it. I could not reason with myself about her; I had no power of ratiocination which could overcome the blinding dazzle of her beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2208"/>The master-passion, which had wrestled down all others, gave to every sentiment of the mind something of its own peculiar character.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2209"/>I will not trouble you with a connected history of my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> love, my boyish love, you may perhaps call it. Suffice it to say, that on the revelation of that love, it was answered by its object warmly and sympathizingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2210"/>I had hardly dared to hope for her favor; for I had magnified her into something far beyond mortal desert; and to hear from her own lips an avowal of affection seemed more like the condescension of a pitying angel than the sympathy of a creature of passion and frailty like myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2211"/>I was miserably self <pb id="p.286" n="286"/> deceived; and self-deception is of a nature most repugnant to the healthy operation of truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2212"/>We suspect others, but seldom ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2213"/>The deception becomes a part of our self-love; we hold back the error even when Reason would pluck it away from us.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2214"/>Our whole life may be considered as made up of earnest yearnings after objects whose value increases with the difficulties of obtaining them, and which seem greater and more desirable, from our imperfect knowledge of their nature, just as the objects of the outward vision are magnified and exalted when seen through a natural telescope of mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2215"/>Imagination fills up and supplies the picture, of which we can only catch the outlines, with colors brighter, and forms more perfect, than those of reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2216"/>Yet, you may perhaps wonder why, after my earnest desire had been gratified, after my love had found sympathy in its object, I did not analyze more closely the inherent and actual qualities of her heart and intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2217"/>But living, as I did, at a considerable distance from her, and seeing her only under circumstances calculated to confirm previous impressions, I had few advantages, even had I desired to do so, of studying her true character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2218"/>The world had not yet taught me its ungenerous lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2219"/>I had not yet learned to apply the rack of philosophical analysis to the objects around me, and test, by a cold process of reasoning, deduced from jealous observation, the reality of all which wore the outward semblance of innocence and beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2220"/>And it may be, too, that the belief, nay, the assurance, from her own lips, and <pb id="p.287" n="287"/> from the <num value="1000">thousand</num> voiceless but eloquent signs which marked our interviews, that I was beloved, made me anxious to deceive even myself, by investing her with those gifts of the intellect and the heart, without which her very love would have degraded its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2221"/>It is not in human nature, at least it was not in mine, to embitter the delicious aliment which is offered to our vanity, by admitting any uncomfortable doubts of the source from which it is derived.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2222"/>And thus it was that I came on, careless and secure, dreaming over and over the same bright dream; without any doubt, without fear, and in the perfect confidence of an unlimited trust, until the mask fell off, all at once; without giving me time for preparation, without warning or interlude; and the features of cold, heartless, systematic treachery glared full upon me.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2223"/>I saw her wedded to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2224"/>It was a beautiful morning; and never had the sun shone down on a gayer assemblage than that which gathered together at the village church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2225"/>I witnessed the imposing ceremony which united the only <num value="1">one</num> being I had ever truly loved to a happy and favored, because more wealthy, rival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2226"/>As the gray-haired man pronounced the inquiring challenge, <quote>If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together, let him now speak or else forever after hold his peace,</quote> I struggled forward, and would have cried out, but the words died away in my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2227"/>And the ceremony went on, and the death-like trance into which I had fallen was broken by the voice of the priest: <quote> I <pb id="p.288" n="288"/> require and charge ye both, as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, that if either of you know of any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured, that if any persons are joined together otherwise than as <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> word doth allow, their marriage is not lawful.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2228"/>As the solemn tones of the old man died away in the church aisles, I almost expected to hear a supernatural voice calling upon him to forbear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2229"/>But there was no sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2230"/>For an instant my eyes met those of the bride; the blood boiled rapidly to her forehead, and then sank back, and she was as pale as if death had been in the glance I had given her. And I could see the folds of her rich dress tremble, and her beautiful lips quiver; and she turned away her eyes, and the solemn rites were concluded.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2231"/>I returned to my lodgings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2232"/>I heeded not the gay smiles and free merriment of those around me. I hurried along like <num value="1">one</num> who wanders abroad in a dark dream; for I could hardly think of the events of the morning as things of reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2233"/>But, when I spurred my horse aside, as the carriage which contained the newly married swept by me, the terrible truth came upon me like a tangible substance, and <num value="1">one</num> black and evil thought passed over my mind, like the whispered suggestion of Satan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2234"/>It was a feeling of blood, a sensation like that of grasping the strangling throat of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2235"/>I started from it with horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2236"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time a thought of murder had risen up in my bosom; and I quenched it with the natural abhorrence of a nature prone to mildness and peace.

<p>I reached my chamber, and, exhausted alike in mind and body, I threw myself upon my bed, but not to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2238"/>A sense of my utter desolation and loneliness came over me, blended with a feeling of bitter and unmerited wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2239"/>I recollected the many manifestations of affection which I had received from her who had that day given herself, in the presence of Heaven, to another; and I called to mind the <num value="1000">thousand</num> sacrifices I had made to her lightest caprices, to every shade and variation of her temper; and then came the maddening consciousness of the black ingratitude which had requited such tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2240"/>Then, too, came the thought, bitter to a pride like mine, that the cold world had a knowledge of my misfortunes; that I should be pointed out as a disappointed man, a subject for the pity of some, and the scorn and jestings of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2241"/>Rage and shame mingled with the keen agony of outraged feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2242"/><quote>I will not endure it,</quote> I said, mentally, springing from my bed and crossing the chamber with a flushed brow and a strong step; <quote>never!</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2250"/>Oh! it is terrible to smile when the heart is breaking!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2251"/>to talk lightly and freely and mirthfully, when every feeling of the mind is wrung with unutterable agony; to mingle in the laugh and in the gay volleys of convivial fellowship, <quote rend="blockquote">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2253"/>It was late when they left me. I walked out to look for the last time upon Nature in her exceeding beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2254"/>I hardly acknowledged to myself that such was my purpose; but yet I did feel that it was so; and that I was taking an everlasting farewell of the beautiful things around me. The sun was just setting; and the hills, that rose like pillars of the blue horizon, were glowing with a light which was fast deserting the valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2255"/>It was an evening of summer; everything was still; not a leaf stirred in the dark, overshadowing foliage; but, silent and beautiful as a picture, the wide <pb id="p.291" n="291"/> scenery of rock and hill and woodland, stretched away before me; and, beautiful as it was, it seemed to possess a newness and depth of beauty beyond its ordinary appearance, as if to aggravate the pangs of the last, long farewell.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2256"/>They do not err who believe that man has a sympathy with even inanimate Nature, deduced from a common origin; a chain of co-existence and affinity connecting the outward forms of natural objects with his own fearful and wonderful machinery; something, in short, manifested in his love of flowing waters, and soft green shadows, and pleasant blowing flowers, and in his admiration of the mountain, stretching away into heaven, sublimed and awful in its cloudy distance; the heave and swell of the infinite ocean; the thunder of the leaping cataract; and the onward rush of mighty rivers, which tells of its original source, and bears evidence of its kindred affinities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2257"/>Nor was the dream of the ancient Chaldean <quote>all a dream.</quote>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2258"/>The stars of heaven, the beauty and the glory above us, have their influences and their power, not evil and malignant and partial and irrevocable, but holy and tranquillizing and benignant, a moral influence, by which all may profit if they will do so. And I have often marvelled at the hard depravity of that human heart which could sanction a deed of violence and crime in the calm solitudes of Nature, and surrounded by the enduring evidences of an overruling Intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2259"/>I could conceive of crime, growing up rank and monstrous in the unwholesome atmosphere of the thronged city, amidst the taint of moral as well as physical pestilence, <pb id="p.292" n="292"/> and surrounded only by man and the works of man. But there is something in the harmony and quiet of the natural world which presents a reproving antagonism to the fiercer passions of the human heart; an eye of solemn reprehension looks out from the still places of Nature, as if the <name>Great Soul</name> of the <name>Universe</name> had chosen the mute creations of his power to be the witnesses of the deeds done in the body, the researchers of the bosoms of men.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2326"/>I had heard that he was extremely ill, indeed, that his life was despaired of; and I may mention that at this period all my mind's operations were dilatory; there were no sudden emotions; passion seemed exhausted; and when once any new train of thought had been suggested, it gradually incorporated itself with those which had preceded it, until it finally became sole and predominant, just as certain plants of the tropical islands wind about and blend with and finally take the place of those of another species.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3068"/>The landlord was a <pb id="p.390" n="390"/> spiteful little man, whose sour, pinched look was a standing libel upon the state of his larder.
