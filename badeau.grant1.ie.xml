<milestone unit="sentence" n="1"/>the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> states that composed the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> had grown in the course of <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> to <num value="34">thirty-four</num>; the territory, which had at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been limited to a narrow strip along the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>, had spread to the <placeName reg="Pacific Ocean" key="tgn,7014652">Pacific ocean</placeName>, and embraced a region as wide as the mightiest empires of the Old World; from the chain of great lakes on the north, to the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> on the south, the republic stretched out a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> across.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>This land abounded in untold agricultural and mineral wealth; commerce enriched the portions bordering on the sea, manufactures thrived; the taxes were inconsiderable, and a national debt almost unknown, and a degree of material prosperity was attained entirely without precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>Education was more widely diffused than in any country since the invention of letters, the influence of religion was universally acknowledged, the rich and the poor were equal before the law, and every male citizen had a share in the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>The nation was powerful abroad as well as prosperous at home; the title of <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName> was a passport that secured protection in every foreign land; peace <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> had smiled on the territory of the <rs>Union</rs> for more than half a century, and a generation had grown up unused to war. The future of this people was even more brilliant in promise than the present in fruition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>Made up, indeed, of different populations, with various characters, and of separate origin, yet with so much unity of interest and homogeneity of feeling; allied by so many memories of the past, and so many aspirations for the future; with the numerous peculiarities of passion, and condition, and race, apparently so harmoniously adjusted, it seemed as if no serious disaster could ever occur to mar its greatness or interfere with its prosperity.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>But questions of a subtle political character arose, about which the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern states differed widely and antagonistically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>The institution of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 10" reg="Africa,">African</placeName> slavery existed at the <rs>South</rs>, but had been abolished at the <rs>North</rs>; and the destiny of <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of slaves, as well as the extension of slavery itself, was violently discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/>The independent rights of the states, and the supremacy of the general government, were asserted and denied by turns; politicians, for personal or party reasons, promoted the discord and exaggerated the antagonisms; and, after years of controversy, the quarrel was referred to the decision of the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>A presidential election ensued, which resulted in the elevation of a Northerner to power, who had received no electoral vote from any Southern state, and who was pledged to resist, by all lawful means, the extension of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>He was also pledged to allow no interference with the institution, where it already existed; but his success was looked upon by the <rs>South</rs> as the inauguration of a direct attack upon slavery, and became the signal for an <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> attempt to destroy that Union which the <rs>South</rs> had done as much to establish and defend as the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><num value="11">Eleven</num> Southern states claimed the right to secede from what they called the federal alliance; but the <rs>Northern</rs> states maintained that the bond of union was indissoluble, and that secession was rebellion; and each party was ready to fight for the maintenance of its views.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The Southerners began the war, without waiting for any overt act from the <rs>North</rs>: they not only assumed to secede, and set up a government for themselves, which they called a Confederacy, but they seized the national forts and arsenals within their territory; and at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Fort Sumter, in South Carolina</placeName>, before resistance was offered, they fired on the national flag and compelled the surrender of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This circumstance united the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Hitherto, there had been many Northerners who thought that the <rs>South</rs> had grievances, and who were anxious to redress them; many, who were willing to compromise all the questions at issue, save only that of union; and some, who were even willing to allow the <rs>Southern</rs> states to depart in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But the gun fired at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> put an end to all such sentiments; the government at once determined to maintain its authority, and the people unanimously seconded the government; or, rather, the people determined, and the government executed their will.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The standing <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName>, at this time, numbered <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num>, <num value="433">four hundred and thirty-three</num> men; or <num value="10">ten</num> regiments of infantry, <num value="4">four</num> of artillery, and <num value="5">five</num> of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It was officered by Southerners as well as Northerners; men educated by the national government, at the national schools, <pb id="p.4" n="4"/> and sworn to support the national authority; out of <num value="1074">one thousand and seventy-four</num> officers, <num value="270">two hundred and seventy</num> were of Southern birth, embracing a fair share of the talent and distinction of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="202">Two hundred and two</num> of these espoused the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>When it became apparent that war was inevitable, they resigned their commissions, and offered their swords to their own section, holding the authority of a state paramount to that of the <rs>Union</rs>.<note anchored="yes">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> 
<p><num value="180">One hundred and eighty</num> resigned; <num value="22">twenty-two</num> were dismissed, or dropped from the rolls.</p></note> They were followed into secession by <num value="50">fifty</num> others from Northern or border states, most of whom had married Southern wives or acquired Southern property.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This defection of course greatly disorganized the small force at the disposal of the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But even had these officers remained firm in their allegiance, the military power of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at this time was insignificant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> therefore at once issued a proclamation, declaring the existence of an armed rebellion, and calling for <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> volunteer troops to suppress it. They came instantly, from every quarter of the <rs>North</rs>, more than he called for. But the proclamation had an equally remarkable effect upon the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Many of these had been bitterly opposed to disunion, although all concurred in deprecating any interference by the <rs>North</rs> or by the general government, with the peculiar institution of the <rs>South</rs>; but when <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n0259.0001.00004.00001" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,A.,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> announced his intention of coercing the states which attempted to secede, the unanimity of the <rs>South</rs> in resistance became a parallel to that of the <rs>North</rs> in restraining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Advantage of this was taken at once by the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders, many <pb id="p.5" n="5"/> of whom had long been preparing for the very emergency which now occurred; armies were organized with extraordinary diligence and energy by the self-styled <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate government</orgName>, and the <rs>American</rs> civil war began.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From the intestine nature of the struggle and the geographical formation of the continent, the principal theatre of the war, it was evident, must lie in the states bordering on both sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The belt of territory reaching from the <rs>Atlantic</rs> westward, and comprising <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> east of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> west of those mountains, constitutes this border region, and was the stage on which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of the drama were performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><placeName key="tgn,2595792" n="1.000 2" reg="potomac river">The Potomac</placeName> and the <rs>James</rs>, at the east; the <rs>Ohio</rs>, the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, and the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, at the west, are the great streams, the control of which, and of the populations and regions that lie in their valleys, is indispensable to a mastery of the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><placeName reg="The Mississippi">The Mississippi</placeName>, recipient and greatest of them all, divides the continent for <measure n="4000miles" type="distance">four thousand miles</measure>; bounds <num value="10">ten</num> different states, and enriches all the region between the <rs>Rocky</rs> and the <rs type="place">Alleghany mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In these regions, and for the mastery of these rivers and states, the earliest battles of <persName n="Grant,,Ulysses,S.,," id="n0259.0001.00006.00002" reg="default:Grant,Ulysses,S.,,"><foreName>Ulysses</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> were fought; from this field, he was taken to command the national armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>Until this battle, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0004.00094.00867" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had supposed, as nearly every <num value="1">one</num> else did at the <rs>North</rs>, that <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> victories for the <rs>Union</rs> would induce the <rs>South</rs> to return to its allegiance; but, when the rebels recovered so soon from the crushing defeat of <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n0259.0004.00094.00868" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName> to make the prodigious effort of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName>; when even the loss of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio" key="tgn,7013448">Bowling Green</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklin, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus</placeName>, and nearly all of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, appeared not to lessen their energy or overcome their determination, <pb id="p.95" n="95"/> he became certain that the contest was to be prolonged and intense, beyond any thing that had yet been seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>This belief developed his peculiar views of the manner in which the war should be carried on. He thought then, and remained firm in the conviction ever afterwards, that it was not extended territory, nor capital cities, nor fortified places, that should be the prime object of any commander's strategy; for it had been proven that all these could be dispensed with by heroic and determined foes; but that armies and men must become the points of attack; that these should be pursued wherever they moved, regardless, comparatively, of positions and forts; that the armies must not only be defeated, but destroyed; and that, therefore, the policy of merely outwitting or out-manoeuvring the enemy, or forcing the evacuation of strongholds and the abandonment of territory, and allowing him thus to concentrate his real force, was unwise; that every effort should be made to find and fight the rebel armies again and again, and that only when those armies were either subdued or annihilated, would the rebellion end. Upon this idea he thereafter acted, so far as he had control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>He did not underrate the value of places, but he was always willing to sacrifice them for armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>He did not depreciate the value of life, but he thought that even life should be freely spent, if so the great object of the war could be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>He believed, indeed, that life rapidly expended in a vigorous campaign, would prove an economy of life in the end.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>This war, too, was fought with a degree of determination and unanimity on the part of the rebels, rarely shown in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>They themselves rendered necessary the terrible nature of <pb id="p.96" n="96"/> the blows which alone could overcome them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>They refused to yield because they had lost their fortresses, or because they had abandoned their cities, or even because <num value="1">one</num> army was surrendered and, here and there, other armies were repelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>There was no course left, if the rebellion was to be suppressed, but to annihilate its strength, and root out the resources that supplied that strength.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>From this time, therefore, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0004.00096.00869" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> gave up the idea of saving the resources and sparing the property of the <rs>South</rs>; the <rs>South</rs> had made the war avowedly <num value="1">one</num> of the people, and the people being a party must suffer, until the people as well as the soldiers were conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>Henceforth, he gave his subordinates orders to live upon the resources of the country without stint, whenever their necessities compelled; and he abandoned all desire to protect the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, although he himself had been a slaveholder, and had no sympathy with the merely political idea of abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>Whatever opposed the effort to maintain the unity of the country, must be destroyed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>Until these views were adopted and carried out firmly and persistently, in every part of the theatre of war, the country was not saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2733"/>The war of the rebellion was not like wars on <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 10" reg="Europe,">European</placeName> battle-fields, where the opposing generals can overlook the contending armies as <num value="2">two</num> chess-players do their board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2734"/>The extensive forests which cover the <rs>Southern</rs> country gave the rebels the advantage of a great natural defence, and afforded a cloak to all their movements to surprise or outflank an invading army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2736"/>Railroads, therefore, became the vital lines of support to all defensive armies, and the object of attack to every invading column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2737"/>All the strategy of the war was based on the importance and applicability of this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2738"/>The rapid concentration of troops and the transportation of supplies, the relief of beleag uered garrisons, the separation of supporting armies, often depended solely on the security or destruction of railroad lines.

The great <rs>Corsican</rs> forced the cities and towns that he conquered to furnish him supplies; but he did it deliberately, and in advance; he made his arrangements according to a system of forced requisitions, and through the authorities; he never plunged into a hostile region with no more supplies than his army carried in their haversacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2749"/>This may, indeed, have been done for a day or <num value="2">two</num>, on a forced march, or for a special object, but never at the outset of a campaign which was expected to endure for weeks, and in which a force greater than his own was sure to be encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2753"/>There was no time for elaborate requisitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2754"/>Parties of men were dispatched each night, as well as often during the march by day, who scoured the country for miles on each side of the main column of march; these visited every planta tion and farmhouse, ransacked every barn, worked every mill, seized every animal; they were always supposed to be under command of officers, but it often happened that squads of men were without this restraint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2755"/>There was, however, not much time for pillage; the movements were too rapid, and the danger of capture to stragglers too imminent, for any great amount of plundering: indeed, the constant <pb id="p.293" n="293"/> motion of the troops gave less time for even the collection of supplies, than might otherwise have been thought indispensable.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2874"/>In addition to these tactical considerations, it was known that <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0259.0009.00308.03080" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was at <placeName reg="Canton, Madison, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056100">Canton</placeName>, with the troops that had escaped from <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n0259.0009.00308.03081" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, reenforced by others from the <name>east</name> and <name>south</name>; that accessions were daily reaching him, and that every soldier the rebel government could gather up, in all its territory, would doubtless soon be sent to <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0259.0009.00308.03082" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="2876"/>Possession of <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburg</placeName>, on the contrary, would enable <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0009.00308.03084" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to turn upon <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n0259.0009.00308.03085" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and drive him from the state; to seize all the railroads and practical military highways, and effectually secure all the territory west of the <placeName key="tgn,2724652" n="1.000 20" reg="tombigbee river, united states">Tombigbee river</placeName>, before the season for active campaigning in this latitude should be past; the government would thus be saved all necessity of sending him reenforcements, now so much needed elsewhere.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3131"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ground was broken on the <dateStruct value="-05-23"><day reg="23">23d</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and batteries placed in the most advantageous positions to keep down the rebel fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3132"/>Lines of parapet, rifle-trench, and covered way were then constructed to connect these batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3133"/>The enemy seldom showed his guns, hardly attempting, indeed, to prevent the besiegers from getting their artillery into position; for, the slightest exposure or demonstration on the part of the rebels excited the liveliest fire from the national batteries, and the advantage was always in favor of the latter, as they could bring to bear a much larger number of guns than the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3134"/>This, and the remarkable activity and vigilance of <orgName n="sharpshooters"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0010.00335.03337" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s sharpshooters</orgName>, in a great measure kept down the fire of the besieged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3135"/>The enemy, however, was undoubtedly scant of ammunition, and anxious to husband what he had, for more effective use at closer quarters.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3136"/>The connecting parapets, as well as all other available positions within rifle range, were kept occupied by a line of sharpshooters during daylight, and by trench-guards and advanced pickets, after dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3137"/>Wherever an approach gave opportunity, loopholes were formed, by piling sand-bags and pieces of square timber on the parapet, or logs and stumps, when these were more convenient; the men were thus enabled to shelter themselves completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3138"/>This timber was rarely displaced by the enemy's fire; but, had the rebel artillery opened heavily, splinters must have become dangerous to the besiegers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3139"/>The positions of the national sharpshooters were generally quite as elevated as those occupied by the rebels; and the approaches, running along the hillsides and up the slopes in front of the enemy's works, were <pb id="p.336" n="336"/> lower than the besieged, so that the sappers and working-parties could not be molested by the rebels, without very great exposure on their own part to sharpshooters of the attacking force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3140"/>So effective was this system, that, by the end of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fortnight, nearly all the artillery of the enemy was either dismounted or withdrawn, and the rebels scarcely ever fired.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3141"/>The style of work in the batteries was varied, depending entirely on the material that could be obtained at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3142"/>In some cases, the lines were neatly revetted with gabions and fascines, and furnished with substantial plank platforms; while, in others, a revetting of rough boards or cotton bales was used, and the platforms were made of timber from the nearest barn or cotton-gin house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3143"/>The embrasures were sometimes revetted with cane, and sometimes lined with hides taken from the beef-cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3144"/>The parapets were not often more than <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> thick, as the enemy's artillery-fire was feeble; but, in all close batteries, the gunners soon found the necessity of keeping the embrasures closed against rifle-balls, by plank shutters, sometimes swung from a timber across the top of the embrasure, sometimes merely placed in the embrasure, and removed in firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3145"/>In close approaches, the sap was generally revetted with gabions, empty barrels, or cotton bales, but sometimes left entirely unrevetted; for, when the enemy's fire was heavy, it became difficult to prevent the working-parties from sinking the sap as deep as <num value="5">five</num> or even <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure>, when, of course, revetting became unnecessary.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3146"/>Material for gabions was abundant, grape-vine being chiefly used, though this made the gabions inconveniently <pb id="p.337" n="337"/> heavy, the vines being too large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3147"/>Cane was also used for wattling, the joints being crushed with wooden mallets, and the rest of the cane split, and interwoven between the stakes of the gabion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3148"/>The cane made excellent fascines, and was frequently used in this way. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, some difficulty was found in making sap-rollers, which should be impervious to Minie balls, and yet not too heavy for use on the rough ground over which the sap must run. <measure n="2barrels" type="mass">Two barrels</measure>, however, were placed head to head, and the sap-roller was then built of cane fascines, wound around this hollow core.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3149"/>At <num value="1">one</num> point, the enemy's salient was too high for the besiegers to be able to return the hand-grenades which were thrown into the trenches so freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3150"/>There were no Cohorn-mortars with the army, and wooden mortars were therefore made, by shrinking iron bands on cylinders of tough wood, and boring them out for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="12l." type="pounds"><num value="12">twelve</num> pound</measure> shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3151"/>These mortars stood firing well, and gave good results at a distance of <num value="100">one hundred</num> or <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3152"/>The labor in the trenches was performed either by men of the pioneer companies, by details from the line, or by negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3153"/>Several of the pioneer companies had negroes attached to them, who had come within the national lines, and were paid according to law. These proved very efficient, when under good supervision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3154"/>The labor performed by details from the line was light, in comparison with that done by the same number of pioneers or negroes; without the stimulus of danger, or pecuniary reward, troops of the line would not work so efficiently, especially at night, and after the novelty of the labor had worn off.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3155"/>The lack of engineer officers gave the siege <num value="1">one</num> <pb id="p.338" n="338"/> of its peculiar characteristics; at many times, and at different places, the work to be done depended on officers and men without either theoretical or practical knowledge of siege operations, and who had, therefore, to rely, almost exclusively, on their native good sense and ingenuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3156"/>Whether a battery was to be constructed by men who had never built <num value="1">one</num> before, or sap-rollers made by those who had never heard the name, or a ship's gun-carriage put together by infantry soldiers, it was always done, and, after a few trials, well done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3157"/>This fertility of resource and power of adaptation to circumstances, possessed in so high a degree by the volunteers, was, however, displayed while a relieving force was gathering in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0010.00338.03338" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3163"/>These roads had originally been built on the most suitable <pb id="p.339" n="339"/> and even ground for ingress to the city; in almost every case, they followed the back of a narrow transverse ridge, between ravines on either side, more or less rugged and tortuous in character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3164"/>The nature of the ground gained in the assaults allowed the national forces to dispense with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> parallels, generally necessary in a siege; the natural surface, undefended by either artillery or skirmishers, affording ample protection in all cases, up to within <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure>, and often within <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure> of the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3173"/>The troops were moved on at the same time, and encamped in the rear of batteries, at the heads of ravines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3174"/>On the <dateStruct value="-06-30"><day reg="30">30th</day> of <month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> there were in position <num value="220">two hundred and twenty</num> guns, mostly light field-pieces; <num value="1">one</num> battery <pb id="p.340" n="340"/> of heavy guns, on the right, was manned and officered by the navy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3175"/>After the assault of <dateStruct value="-05-22"><month reg="05">May</month> <day reg="22">22d</day></dateStruct>, the enemy's defence was feeble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3176"/>As the national batteries were built and opened, the rebel artillery-fire slackened, until, towards the close of the siege, it was hardly employed at all; the enemy contenting himself with occasionally running a gun into position, firing <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> rounds, and withdrawing the piece again as soon as the national fire was concentrated in reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3177"/>At almost any point, if the rebels had put <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> guns into position, instead of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>, which merely invited concentration of the besiegers' fire, they might have seriously delayed the approaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3178"/>This silence of the artillery was attributed to a lack of ammunition; but a judicious use of the ordnance which the rebels really possessed would have interfered greatly with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0010.00340.03341" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3179"/>As it was, he had little but musketry-fire to contend with in the more distant approaches and parallels, and even this was sparingly used, in comparison with that of the besiegers: a deficiency in <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs> probably accounts in some measure for this fact.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3180"/>The enemy sometimes resorted to mines, to delay the approaches of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0010.00340.03342" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>; but they were feeble, their charges always light, and they rarely did other damage than to make the ground where they had been exploded, impracticable for mining by the besiegers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3181"/>Occasional sorties were also made, sometimes delaying operations for a day or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3182"/>At <num value="1">one</num> point, the enemy opened <measure n="90yards" type="distance">ninety yards</measure> of trench, as a counter-work, running down the ridge from a rebel salient, and quite up to the parallel of the besiegers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3183"/>But the position was recovered the next night by a <pb id="p.341" n="341"/> bayonet charge, the enemy routed from his own trench, <num value="12">twelve</num> muskets captured, a portion of the rebel trench then filled up, and the rest easily guarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3184"/>Once or twice, the rebels succeeded in throwing fire-balls, until <num value="1">one</num> lodged under the edge of a saproller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3185"/>Hand-grenades were next thrown into the fire made by the spreading of the inflammable fluid contained in the ball; the grenades bursting, threw fragments all around, tearing the sap-roller, and the enemy then kept up an incessant musketry-fire, until the roller was destroyed and the trench exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3186"/>None of these efforts, however, made any remarkable change in the operations of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0010.00341.03343" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3187"/>The aim of the rebels seemed to be to await another assault, losing in the mean time as few men as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3188"/>This indifference to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n0259.0010.00341.03344" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s approach became, at some points, almost ludicrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3189"/>The besiegers were accustomed to cover the front of their night-working parties by a line of pickets, or by a covering party; and, while these were not closer than a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>, the enemy would throw out his pickets in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3190"/>At <num value="1">one</num> point, the rebel pickets entered into a regular agreement with those of the besiegers, not to fire on each other at night; and, as most of the work in a siege is done at night, this arrangement was eminently satisfactory to the working-parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3191"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, the picket-officer was directed to crowd his pickets on the enemy's, so as to allow the working party to push on another parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3192"/>In doing this, the <num value="2">two</num> lines of pickets became intermixed, and, after some discussion, the opposing officers arranged their lines by mutual compromise, the pickets, in places, not being <measure n="10yards" type="distance">ten yards</measure> apart, and in full view of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3193"/>A working party was then <pb id="p.342" n="342"/> stretched out in rear of the national line, and the work was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3194"/>The enemy's out-guard could see all that was going on, but made no effort to interfere, and a trench was opened within <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> of the rebel salient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3195"/>The ground was such that it would have been difficult to carry on the work in any other way; by merely remaining in his fortifications, and firing an occasional volley, the enemy could have easily stopped the approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3196"/>The advantage of this arrangement, novel in war, was entirely on <num value="1">one</num> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3210"/>This could not well be prevented, as the banks of the stream, between the approach and the rebel work, were both steep and high; and the water here had cut the bed of the stream into an almost impassable chasm.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3847"/>The same spirit that animated them extended to regimental officers, and even to private soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3848"/>The rank and file, especially, were not fighting for fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3849"/>They knew that most of them could have no chance for promotion. . . . Although, here and there, those who distinguished themselves might rise, and did rise, yet, doubtless, gallant deeds were constantly done that never found a chronicler; doubtless, undeveloped talent lay hidden, during all these campaigns, under many a private's coat; doubtless, glory was often won, and the costly price not paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3850"/>This the soldiers knew had been, and felt must be again; yet they fought, and marched, and worked, and died, as willingly as those to whom the great prizes were the incentives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3851"/>They did this, not only under the stimulating enthusiasm which drove them to the field in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of the war, but in the weary months of that long spring of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, under the piercing blasts and pelting storms of <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n0259.0011.00404.03812" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName>, and in the scorching heats and sickening atmosphere of <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3852"/>Without the excitement of danger, as well as in the very presence of quick-coming death, they persisted in doing all that was necessary to accomplish the end they set out to gain.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3853"/>Nor was this simply what every soldier does in war. It is not national partiality which declares that the combination of traits that made this army what it was, and enabled it to do what it did, was essentially American.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3854"/>The mingling of sturdy independence with individual intelligence, of patriotic <pb id="p.405" n="405"/> feeling with practical talent was <orgName type="university" n="American university">American</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3856"/>But it is seldom in the history of war that a race has sprung to arms like that which won the battles of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3857"/>Not, indeed, a highly-cultivated people, but <num value="1">one</num> in whom general education was more widely diffused than in any that ever fought., It was the appreciation each man had of the objects of the war, and his determination to accomplish them; his intelligent love for the <rs>Union</rs>, inspiring an adventurous manliness often acquired in the <rs>Western</rs> woods and on the <rs>Indian</rs> frontier, and combined with the <rs>American</rs> practicalness&mdash;itself often the result of a frontier life&mdash;that produced the <rs>American</rs> soldier.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3858"/>That soldier had a devotion and a gallantry which equalled any displayed on the most famous fields in war; but to these were added a peculiar faculty of applying his intelligence to the every-day means and the ordinary events of a campaign or a siege, enabling him to persevere amid extraordinary difficulties as well as dangers, and, when <num value="1">one</num> means failed to try another, and, when all means seemed lacking, to create means himself, and with these to achieve victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3859"/>This quality was conspicuous in the men who conquered <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3860"/>This made soldiers and officers, and division generals and corps commanders all act as <num value="1">one</num>, all cooperate with their chief, hold up his hands, carry out his plans, act, indeed, as the body of which he was the head; he, the brain to conceive and the will to direct, while they were the means, the limbs and nerves and muscles, to execute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3862"/>His military character was thoroughly the result of American life and American institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3863"/>The same devotion to an idea, which was manifest, not in words nor in enthusiastic expression, but in the deeds of every day; the same intensity of purpose, that was betrayed more in achievement, even than in effort; the practical determination, the self-reliance, rather than self-assertion; the heating of the iron white-hot, rather than red&mdash;to blaze not, but to burn more; all these traits he shared with the soldiers whom he led to victory.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3865"/>His child, almost his creation&mdash;bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh, growing with his growth and strengthening with his strength, sharing his trials, and dangers, and difficulties, and victories; his spirit had infused it, in return its successes had inspired him, and urged him on to greater effort and more complete fulfilment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3866"/>He was to leave that army soon, to assume more difficult positions, to direct grander operations, but he never forgot his old associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3867"/>For he still commanded them, though further off; he directed whither they should march, and where they should conquer, as long as they were an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3868"/>And amid all the varied chances and splendid successes that afterwards befell that army, he watched its career with a solicitude that was prompted by the early trials and triumphs they had shared together.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4057"/>The <rs type="place">Cumberland mountains</rs> constitute the natural boundary between what are called the cotton states &mdash;the semi-tropical region of the <rs>American Union</rs>&mdash;and the vast grain-growing plains of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4058"/>Several important ranges cluster just where the <num value="3">three</num> great states of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> approach nearest to each other; the <pb id="p.427" n="427"/> mountains crowding close, as if to watch the scene where the destinies of mountains and states were both to be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4059"/>From some of the highest points in this vicinity the territory of <num value="7">seven</num> different states can be distinctly seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4060"/>Here, also, the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> breaks through from the east, hemmed in at times on every hand, but making the mountains give it room, and, forcing its way in a <num value="100">hundred</num> windings, until, at last, it eludes or overcomes every barrier, and finds a passage to more western fields.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4061"/>At <num value="1">one</num> of the most abrupt of all its angles, the hills recede so as to leave an open but uneven space, not more than <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> square, bounded on the north by the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, begirt on every side with rugged peaks, and guarded on the west by a grim and almost perpendicular height, that rises directly from the water's edge more than <measure n="2000feet" type="distance">two thousand feet</measure>. This point was once the boundary and the barrier of the <rs>Indian</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4062"/>The southern limit of the field is known as <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary ridge</placeName>, called so by the <name>Indians</name>, who allowed the missionaries to pass no further; a gorge in the mountains, opening south, is still named <placeName reg="Rossville gap">Rossville gap</placeName>, after the famous <placeName reg="Cherokee, Colbert, Alabama" key="tgn,2003069">Cherokee</placeName> chief, <persName n="Ross,,John,,," id="n0259.0012.00427.04025" reg="default:Ross,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Ross</surname></persName>; while the lofty crest that looks out over the rugged valley was called <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>&mdash;the <rs type="place">Eagle's Nest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4063"/>The whole region was a mighty bulwark, covering <num value="1">one</num> of the most important avenues for access to the <rs>South</rs>, between the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4064"/>Away, at the centre of the continent, these precipitous heights, this lonely valley, and this tortuous stream seemed the very spot where the eagles might build their nests, and the aborigines pitch their camps, secure from the intruding step of the white <pb id="p.428" n="428"/> man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4065"/>A railroad must be built, connecting the <rs>Mississippi</rs> with the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and the only route through these almost inaccessible hills was along the <rs type="place">valley of the Tennessee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4066"/>Then, the <rs>South</rs> must be connected with its <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName>; and the line of travel stretched out from <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and all the great railways from the interior of the cotton region, from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, centred at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, and reached up along <num value="1">one</num> line, through ridges and ranges, penetrating them by tunnels when Nature afforded no pathway, until, under the shadow of the <rs type="place">Chattanooga mountain</rs>, the junction with the great eastern line was formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4067"/>Where the railroads from <placeName key="tgn,7017750" n="1.000 4" reg="memphis, shelby, tennessee">Memphis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> meet, a town sprang up, of course, and was named from the mountain at whose base it was built, <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>; while the acclivity itself now received an English name, and was henceforth known as the <rs type="place">Lookout mountain</rs>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4068"/>When the rebellion broke out, it was at once perceived by military men that <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> must become <num value="1">one</num> of the important strategic positions of the war. The <orgName n="Great Railroad" type="railroad">great railway</orgName> lines converging here afforded the rebels immense opportunities for concentrating and supplying their armies&mdash;opportunities which were seized and enjoyed to their full extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4069"/>Connecting the extreme eastern and the western portions of the would-be confederacy, these roads enabled its authorities, again and again, to move troops with facility and promptness from <num value="1">one</num> part of the theatre <pb id="p.429" n="429"/> of war to another, at some critical moment; and, for years, they furnished the principal route by which the eastern armies received their revenues of grain and beef, from the prolific regions of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4070"/>In a word, they became interior strategic lines for all important military operations, and were absolutely vital to the interests of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4071"/>As long as the rebels held <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, these lines were secure; when it passed into national hands, all this internal communication ceased, or was rendered infinitely more difficult, and the door was thrown open for an advance into the very heart of the so-called Confederacy.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4072"/>But, there was still another consideration which made possession of this region important to the national cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4073"/>The inhabitants of the mountain country were strongly loyal; like mountaineers all over the world, their love of liberty and independence and republicanism was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4074"/>Their rough hillsides and sterile soil were unfitted for slave-labor, and the institution which was the origin and cause of the rebellion had never flourished among these beetling cliffs, nor in the rugged valleys that lay between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4075"/>The masses all through <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>, in the western part of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and the northern portions of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, were never false to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4076"/>They were hunted by rebel mobs and proscribed by rebel authorities, were persecuted and driven to caves, imprisoned, starved, tortured, put to death, but remained firm in their allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4077"/>It was a sacred duty of the government to go to the rescue of these people, as well as its plainest policy to reestablish among them the authority, which, it was asserted, the whole <rs>South</rs> was so anxious to <pb id="p.430" n="430"/> overthrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4078"/>Here would be a nucleus for loyalty, here was a population ready to defend and support and assist the national armies, instead of what was found everywhere else at the <rs>South</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> determined to oppose and obstruct and betray.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4079"/><placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> was in the heart of this region and in the midst of this population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4080"/>Its possession would protect these people, and secure these advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4081"/>Next after <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the great political focus of the rebellion, and <placeName key="tgn,7018023" n="1.000 10" reg="vicksburg, warren, mississippi">Vicksburg</placeName>, that fortress and menace of the <rs type="place">Mississippi valley</rs>, <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> loomed up before the nation and the military authorities, as absolutely indispensable to success, and, when once gained, the foundation and forerunner of final victories.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5043"/>And, although this battle had not been planned according to any immutable design, nor the commanders directed by any orders that were irreversible, yet each event proceeded regularly according to the calculation; each subordinate carried out his part exactly as he had been ordered; each army, brought from a distance, came upon the spot intended, crossed a river, or climbed a <pb id="p.529" n="529"/> mountain, at the precise moment; and even the unexpected emergencies of the fight contributed to the result, as if anticipated and arranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5048"/>Once or twice, after bloody battle, it had indeed remained master of the field, but the full advantages of victory it had never reaped; for, although it had really won <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, the possession of the prize had remained insecure; the fruits of its labor had been turned into ashes before they could be enjoyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5049"/>But, now, Fortune's bandage seemed to have fallen from her eyes, and she distributed rewards with an impartial hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5050"/>The Eastern troops had carried the most conspicuous position on the field, and won a strange and picturesque renown, forever associating their names with the mighty mountain that stands at the gate of the <rs>South</rs>; the <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Western army</orgName> had fought harder and longer, and with less brilliant results than either of the others, but, by its persistent gallantry, had rendered possible the great success of the day; while <pb id="p.530" n="530"/> it was fitly reserved for the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName> to win the crowning victory over its old enemy, to carry the heights that had confronted it so long, and, in sight of <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, to accomplish that which <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> had disastrously delayed.</p>
