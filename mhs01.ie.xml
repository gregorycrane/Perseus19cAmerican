<milestone unit="sentence" n="2"/>owing to the fact that allusions to the subject of education in its early records are very few and very meagre, comparatively little can now be said with certainty of <placeName>Medford</placeName> schools and schoolmasters during the <name>Colonial</name> period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="3"/>We do know, however, that amid privation and poverty and constant warfare, not only with a harsh climate, but with <q direct="unspecified">savage beasts and still more savage men,</q> they were laying the foundations of that which we, their descendants, are now richly enjoying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="4"/>Their children are left to estimate the greatness of their labors by the grandeur of the results which have flowed from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="5"/>No commonwealth like <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> can spring up and grow to its present proud position without an adequate cause; and among those who did their share of the work and bore their share of the burdens we may be sure were the early settlers of <placeName>Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="6"/>A prominent and discriminating writer has said that <q direct="unspecified">everything which has power to win the respect and command the obedience of men must have its roots deep in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="7"/>As with our political institutions so with our schools and educational system generally; they were a copy, more or less exact, of what the people had left behind in Old England.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="8"/></p> 
<p>The statement is frequently made that by the law of <dateStruct value="1647--"><year reg="1647">1647</year></dateStruct> <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> established the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> system of free <pb id="p.2" n="2"/> public schools in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>But this is hardly true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They were public schools, and many of them were free; but the law made their support permissive rather than compulsory, and direct taxation for their support was by no means universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In very many cases the town rate, that is, the general tax, was only to supplement other sources of income; and it took many years to make apparent that <q direct="unspecified">tuition fees from the rich and free tuition for the poor made class distinctions too pronounced in a new society where in church and state all were equal.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/></p> 
<p>We must not forget, moreover, that <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> was small and poor and insignificant, enveloped literally and overshadowed by its larger and more prosperous neighbor, <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was scarcely more than <placeName><persName n="Cradock,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0002.00002.00002" reg="nearbymention:Cradock,Matthew,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Cradock</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>; and in <dateStruct value="1700--"><year reg="1700">1700</year></dateStruct> its population probably did not exceed <num value="200">two hundred</num> souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In <dateStruct value="1686--"><year reg="1686">1686</year></dateStruct> the county rate contained only <num value="14">fourteen</num> names, and the whole number of polls in <dateStruct value="1695--"><year reg="1695">1695</year></dateStruct> was but <num value="26">twenty-six</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>While the law passed by the <rs type="place">Colonial Court</rs> in <dateStruct value="1692--"><year reg="1692">1692</year></dateStruct> required every town of <num value="50">fifty</num> householders to support a school for reading and writing, it was not till <measure n="27years" type="date">twenty-seven years</measure> later that <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> made any move to establish such a school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Lying so near <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, we may feel certain that if she had had the requisite number of people she would have been obliged to comply with the law, even if reluctant to do so. Its insignificance, furthermore, may be inferred from the fact that although incorporated as a town in <dateStruct value="1630--"><year reg="1630">1630</year></dateStruct> no <num value="1">one</num> of its people seemed to be aware of the fact till about <dateStruct value="1680--"><year reg="1680">1680</year></dateStruct>,&mdash;<measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> later,&mdash;and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> white child born within its borders had become an old man of <num value="83">eighty-three</num> before it had a settled minister, and this in a thorough-going puritan settlement.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Very likely as she drew her preaching from ministers settled in the surrounding towns, and from young men studying in <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard college</orgName>, so her brighter and more ambitious boys managed to attend the public schools <pb id="p.3" n="3"/> established in those places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The distance was not excessive, and the boys of those days did not shrink from such a daily walk as this would require.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><q direct="unspecified">Moreover, the children of those days learned to spell work with a capital W,</q> says <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00003" reg="mostcommon:Martin,nomatch:0"><surname>Martin</surname></persName> in his <q direct="unspecified">Evolution of the <rs type="place">Public Schools</rs> of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If they came <q direct="unspecified">trailing clouds of glory,</q> nevertheless <q direct="unspecified">the shades of the prison house</q> began early to close about them, and long before they became men they must have perceived <q direct="unspecified">the vision splendid die away and fade into the light of common day.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/></p> 
<p>We are accustomed to think and to say that our ancestors when they landed on these shores brought with them the meeting-house and the school-house, and that these were the corner-stones on which they built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In a certain sense this is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They brought the meeting-house to be sure, and they gave neither sleep to their eyes nor slumber to their eyelids till they had erected a house wherein to worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; but the schoolhouse had to wait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The children's day had not then dawned, only the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faint streaks of light were visible above the eastern horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Neither <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00003.00004" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName> in his perfect republic nor <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName></persName> More in his ideal state had ever dreamed of such a thing as the <rs>American</rs> common school, where every child, the poorest as well as the richest, girl as well as boy, can claim, not as a charity, but as a right, the possession of the keys of all knowledge; and for the support of which a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mortgage is held on every cent of the accumulations of every childless millionaire.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The law of <dateStruct value="1642--"><year reg="1642">1642</year></dateStruct>, while recognizing to the full parental responsibility, suggested not only the viciousness of indolence and the educative office of labor, but just as plainly indicated the state ownership of the child and its responsibility for him.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>That the successive holders of this property are trustees, bound to the faithful execution of their trust by the most sacred obligations; and that embezzlement and pillage from children have not less of criminality, and more of meanness, than the same offences perpetrated against contemporaries.</p></quote> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Domestic instruction by the mother was obliged to take the place of any public schooling, and we may be sure also that women whose hearts were brave enough to follow their husbands to this savage shore were wise enough to see that their babes were not wholly left a prey to ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>And so while the husband was fighting <name>Indians</name> and wringing subsistence from a reluctant soil, the wife was seeing to it that the children learned to read the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> and repeat the catechism and obey the commandments of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We may not doubt that the dame school flourished&mdash; a school, as the poet <persName n="Crabbe,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00004.00006" reg="mostcommon:Crabbe,nomatch:0"><surname>Crabbe</surname></persName> sings: <quote rend="blockquote">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The sanded floor served as blackboard, and the same rod that struck terror to evil-doers made a very good substitute for a crayon, a bit of birch bark or a broad chip made an excellent slate, and charcoal was as good as chalk.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The home, which with their descendants seems to be so fast dying out, was the centre and source of their whole life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><q direct="unspecified">It was the conviction,</q> says <persName n="Mayo,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00007" reg="mostcommon:Mayo,nomatch:0"><surname>Mayo</surname></persName> in his <q direct="unspecified">Public Schools in the <rs>Colonial Period</rs>,</q> <q direct="unspecified">that every child born into this world is the child of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, capable of becoming a vital and useful member of society; and the corresponding obligation of the community to give to it the opportunity of that training at home, in the church, and in the school, which should send it forth at early manhood or womanhood a self-directing competent person and a reputable citizen of a self-governed state, that was at work silently and persistently below the surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This conviction was the corner-stone of every respectable <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> home, and explains, as nothing else can, the domestic life of that people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>And out of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> home, not from church or state, was born the early <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Here was the beginning of the <rs>American</rs> common school, the most precious gift to the <rs>Republic</rs> from the genius of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>,&mdash;the stone for <measure n="250years" type="date">two hundred and fifty years</measure> so persistently rejected by the builders of other commonwealths, but in these later days now recognized as the head of the corner,&mdash;the corner-stone of the new republic that cannot be broken, but upon whomsoever it shall fall it shall grind him to powder.</q>

<p>Their ideas of education were crude, doubtless, but they were fully abreast of the times in which they lived, when only the preacher and the politician, the doctor and the lawyer, needed to know more than to read and write; and when, if a girl knew how to spin and to rock a cradle, she had all the education that was good for her. <q direct="unspecified">Of the women,</q> says <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n0334.0002.00005.00008" reg="mostcommon:Martin,nomatch:0"><surname>Martin</surname></persName>, <q direct="unspecified">whose names appear in the recorded deeds of the early part of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century, more than <num value="0.6">sixty per cent.</num> made their mark.</q>

<p>In the management of the schools the ministers took a leading part; in fact, when laymen were joined with them as visitors and examiners, the ministers looked upon it rather as an impertinence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The school was opened and closed with prayer, and when the minister visited the school he never neglected to pray with the children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>No <num value="1">one</num> but a church member would have been allowed to keep a school, and no <num value="1">one</num> not a church member would have presumed to do so.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But they were at work on foundations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They builded better than they knew,&mdash;perhaps better in many cases than they intended,&mdash;for we may believe that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> overrules the unwisdom of the sincere and honest worker and evolves therefrom something far better than he dared to hope for.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>At the town meeting the most frequent matters for consideration were the preacher and the meeting-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The meeting-house, by the way, was literally the meeting-house where all matters secular as well as spiritual were discussed and settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>When every citizen was a member of the church, and no other person was thought fit to vote, and when spiritual and secular affairs were all <num value="1">one</num>, this seemed the proper thing to do.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We note in the action at this meeting that the people have diminished the size of their committee, have enlarged the curriculum of their school to include reading, have settled on a place where the school shall be kept, and instructed their committee to go ahead and to report their doings.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>several things are essential to the accomplishment of this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most important is the systematic collection of historical material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>I assume that the <rs>Medford Society</rs> is designed primarily for the collection and preservation of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> history, of which few towns have <num value="1">one</num> more creditable.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who has not undertaken to write the history of his own town can have an adequate sense of the difficulties to be encountered in such an undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seeks all former attempts likely to aid him, whether in printed volumes, or in outlines of town history found in Thanksgiving sermons, <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> orations, or occasional discourses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>But in <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> after such addresses were printed, he may seek long, far, and wide without finding a copy of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>I speak from experience.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Therefore any proposed collection should include not only all such discourses, but also town reports and directories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>It is true that they are not interesting reading, and at the end of the year generally find their way to the fire-kindling box; but to the historian they are of inestimable value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/><pb id="p.21" n="21"/></p> 
<p>Of equal value are plans of roads,&mdash;public or private, &mdash;of bridges and of private estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>These last are of special interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> is largely the history of her eminent men, whose lives have contributed so much to the making of her history; and perhaps there is no stronger desire of their descendants, or of citizens generally, than that of going to the houses in which they lived and tracing the acres they cultivated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But in most cases these ancestral houses no longer exist, and the ancestral acres have been divided into several farms or cut up into house-lots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>I hope that there are those among your members who will give special attention to marking the exact bounds of the old farms, and the sites of the buildings on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>These plans, of course, should be carefully preserved, and, if made, I venture the prediction that no part of your collection will be more assiduously examined, or with more grateful recognition of the value of the services of your society.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The local press is the receptacle of a vast amount of matter not only of present interest, but of great value to the future historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Its issues will of course find a willingly accorded place in your rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I have been favorably impressed by a device of the late <persName n="Moore,Doctor,George,H.,," id="n0334.0008.00021.00385" reg="default:Moore,George,H.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>, a historical writer of great excellence, and librarian of the <orgName n="New York Historical Society" type="society">New York Historical Society</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>He collected not only <num value="1">one</num> but <num value="2">two</num> copies of local papers&mdash; <num value="1">one</num> for binding and another for scrapping; and so that society has a series of newspaper scrap-books of the local press, covering many years, and containing in most convenient form for reference the matters which the historian seeks.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Some years ago a very intelligent citizen of a neighboring city, who had been long resident and participant in its affairs, from the time when it changed from an agricultural community into a prosperous town, ultimately to become a city, contributed to <num value="1">one</num> of the papers a series of articles in which, with remarkable fulness and <pb id="p.22" n="22"/> accuracy, he gave the sites of the residences of the principal citizens, so that they can now be exactly defined, although many of the buildings no longer exist; and what is of equal importance, the original conformation of the harbor shore, and the subsequent changes made by the cutting down of hills and casting them into the sea to the considerable extension of the city's territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The paper long since ceased to be published, and it is doubtful if a bound copy of it is anywhere to be found; and these articles now are extant only in a single scrapped copy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>They should go into a fireproof repository, and their present owner awaits the preparation of such a repository.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Now with regard to manuscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Doubtless many families in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> have family papers of great historical value, which they would decline to part with, preferring to hand them down through successive generations of the family as heirlooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>This natural and commendable purpose might well be entertained but for <num value="2">two</num> reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the law of entail which sends estates down through generations of a family, and the general existence of a fireproof room, render transmission reasonably practicable and safe; but with us the absence of both of these conditions makes it quite otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Let me relate <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> which came within my own observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>In the <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">State of Maine</placeName> lived a man of high consideration in the period of the <name>Revolution</name>, and his papers were <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in value to those of few others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>As has so often happened, his family declined in fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I once visited the old family mansion, then in possession of a female descendant, to whom I suggested, with all possible delicacy, my wish to obtain, for historical purposes and at considerable cost, her ancestor's papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>My proposition was treated as insulting, and I went away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Not long after the lady died, and in less than <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after, her successor to the estate sold to a tin pedler, in exchange for some of his wares, the identical papers which I had <pb id="p.23" n="23"/> been ready to acquire at their fair value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The pedler was not aware of their value except as rags, and carried them to the capital of a neighboring State, where by the merest accident they fell into appreciative hands and ultimately into mine, though sadly impaired in value by careless treatment.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>Another case more important has come also within my observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Some years ago, at the request of the city government of <placeName reg="Chelsea, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015012">Chelsea</placeName>, I undertook to write the history of Winnisimmet and <persName n="Marsh,,Rumney,,," id="n0334.0008.00023.00386" reg="default:Marsh,Rumney,,,"><foreName>Rumney</foreName> <surname>Marsh</surname></persName>, from the earliest times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inquiry was at the <placeName reg="city hall">city hall</placeName> for the old town files, and I was told that there was not even a scrap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Some hints were found in the colony records respecting <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> which proved to be of the highest interest and importance, but neither in the files nor elsewhere were there any papers, for the reason which will immediately appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/><num value="1">One</num> of these cases was respecting the <rs>Capt</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/><persName n="Keayne,,Robert,,," id="n0334.0008.00023.00387" reg="default:Keayne,Robert,,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Keayne</surname></persName> estate in what is now <placeName key="tgn,2050476" n="1.000 4" reg="revere, suffolk, massachusetts">Revere</placeName>, and the other was that of <placeName><persName n="Bellingham,Governor,Richard,,," id="n0334.0008.00023.00388" reg="default:Bellingham,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Bellingham</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>s, which included the whole of the city of <placeName reg="Chelsea, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015012">Chelsea</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>These cases raged in every court,&mdash; colonial, provincial, and State,&mdash;and the latter was in the <rs>English</rs> courts, and finally settled only at the end of <measure n="114years" type="date">one hundred and fourteen years</measure> from its beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Yet nobody knew anything about them save some vague statements found in the public records; and the reason was this: A <placeName reg="Chelsea town">Chelsea town</placeName> clerk, who was also concerned in the later stages of the <name>Bellingham</name> case, on removing from <placeName reg="Chelsea, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7015012">Chelsea</placeName>, near the close of the last century, carried with him into a remote country town not only all the <name>Bellingham</name> case papers, but also the greater part of the town files, both of which have been lately discovered in a very imperfect and dilapidated condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>The above cases are by no means isolated; on the contrary, they have been very common.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>I will only add that doubtless <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, like every ancient town, possesses many intelligent men and women who are competent to recall, investigate, and set down for preservation, local changes, biographical <pb id="p.24" n="24"/> notices, genealogical notes, and other facts which will be otherwise irrecoverably lost, but which, if preserved, will be of great value to the future history of the town.</p></div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1172"/>It was a ship of <num value="828">828</num> tons, the largest ship which up to that time had been built in <pb id="p.80" n="80"/> <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1173"/>It was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> launch I ever saw. How beautiful the brightly painted ship, with her graceful outlines, appeared to me, and with what a thrill I saw the last block knocked away, and the slowly increasing movement of the mighty mass!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1174"/>I can still see the <num value="100">hundred</num> stalwart men on the shore manning the great hawsers, checking and guiding the vessel as she swings into the stream on her way to the wharves of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1177"/>The vessel moved for a short distance and then stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1178"/>A hawser was attached to her, and a tug-boat endeavored to start her down the ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1179"/>After several ineffectual efforts, the boat gave up the job and lay idle in the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1180"/>Suddenly the great vessel ceased to sulk, and, of her own volition, rushed down the ways, advanced on the tug-boat before she could get out of the way, and landed her high and dry upon the opposite bank of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1181"/>Vessels on the launch-ways had many caprices, and it sometimes required a deal of coaxing to get them into the water.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1182"/>But it is useless for me, by any indulgence in pleasant reminiscences, to defer the painful catastrophe with which this narrative must close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1183"/>You have seen that in the last decade of ship-building in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> (<dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>-<dateStruct value="1873--"><year reg="1873">1873</year></dateStruct>) there was a marked decline in the prosperity of the industry: only <num value="14">14</num> ships were built in that period&mdash; hardly more than <num value="1">one</num> ship a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1186"/>The large carrying trade which our ships had enjoyed passed into other hands, and, in the interval, iron had superseded wood in the construction of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1187"/>Competition with foreign builders had become impossible, for they had the advantage of us both in the cheapness of labor and materials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1188"/>Worse than all&mdash;we had lost our grip.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1189"/>It is a matter of regret and shame to all lovers of the <rs>Republic</rs> that the flag that once floated in every harbor of the world has now almost disappeared from the ocean; that the once successful commercial rival of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is now abjectly dependent upon her for the carriage of its own exports and imports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1190"/>It is contrary to the genius of our people that this state of things should be permitted to continue forever; and when the conditions become more favorable, as they surely will, in the further development of our great industrial resources we may hope for the triumphant reestablishment of American commerce.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1195"/>I have been requested to speak of the history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the present century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1196"/>An old writer once said, <q direct="unspecified">Happy are the people who have no history.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1197"/>This is only another mode of expressing the quiet happiness of the calm, contented life in which so many of our <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> towns moved on, with little to record and little to disturb them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1198"/>Not being a native of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, and not yet a centenarian, I can hardly be expected to have any personal recollection of the early portion of the half-century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1199"/>My sources of information are the same that are accessible to most of you, the town records, the history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> so carefully prepared by <persName n="Brooks,Reverend,Charles,,," id="n0334.0022.00082.01022" reg="default:Brooks,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>, and the traditions and recollections of the few survivors of that early time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1202"/>There were really but <num value="2">two</num> events of importance which marked the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1203"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1204"/>At that time Dr. (afterwards Governor) <placeName key="tgn,2423378" n="1.000 1" reg="john brook, windham, connecticut">John Brooks</placeName>, a native of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, had at the conclusion of the <name>Revolutionary</name> war returned to the home of his childhood and resumed the practice of his profession, living in the old house which was taken down a few years ago and replaced by the building of the <orgName n="Savings Bank" type="bank">Savings Bank</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1206"/>In this war <num value="18">eighteen</num> <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> citizens enlisted, <num value="2">two</num> of whom, <persName n="Gates,,Edmund,,," id="n0334.0022.00083.01023" reg="default:Gates,Edmund,,,"><foreName>Edmund</foreName> <surname>Gates</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shed,,Abiel,R.,," id="n0334.0022.00083.01024" reg="default:Shed,Abiel,R.,,"><foreName>Abiel</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Shed</surname></persName>, were killed in battle.</p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1208"/>But the <name>Embargo</name> of <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, so destructive to the mercantile prosperity of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, closed that career for a time, but it was renewed soon after, and he returned to his chosen profession.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1209"/>But when the war broke out he received a commission as captain in the army, and remained and did good service in the army as long as he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1210"/>He was brevetted major for gallant conduct at the battle of <placeName reg="Plattsburgh, Clinton, New York" key="tgn,7016176">Plattsburg</placeName>, and afterwards received a commission as lieutenant-colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1211"/>He once told me a little incident of his experience during the war. A company of sailors had been drafted for service in the fleet on the lakes, and were to march under his command from the <name>North End</name> of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to go into camp at <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1212"/>They marched through <placeName reg="Hanover, Plymouth, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2049868">Hanover</placeName> and down Court streets, and on reaching <address><street n="Washington street">Washington street</street></address> he gave the order, <q direct="unspecified">Right wheel.</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1213"/>Whether as sailors they did not understand the order, or the strong breeze coming up State street with its familiar smell of the sea attracted them, the order shouted out with all his strength was disregarded, and they continued to head straight for <placeName reg="Long wharf">Long wharf</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1214"/>His old instincts as a sailor prompted him, and with a yell as from a speaking-trumpet came the order, <q direct="unspecified">Luff, d&mdash;n you, luff!</q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1215"/>This they understood, and coming up handsomely into the wind's eye took the road for <placeName reg="Roxbury, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015002">Roxbury</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1216"/>The incident was a source of amusement in the papers at the time, and caricatures of it were printed.</p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1218"/>His fate was a singular <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1219"/>He had always a great horror of steamboats, and would never voluntarily travel on <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1220"/>But in <dateStruct value="1836-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1836">1836</year></dateStruct>, he was ordered to proceed from <placeName reg="Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2335409">Fort Moultrie, S.

He embarked on the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Dolphin;</rs> the boilers, as he had always anticipated, blew up, and he was killed.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1221"/>In the early part of the century all male citizens between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num> were compelled to do military duty, unless excused by physical disability or by the holding of certain offices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1222"/>They formed the militia of the <rs>State</rs>, and were usually called out <num value="3">three</num> times a year: in the spring for inspection of arms and equipments, the absence of which, as well as non-appearance, was punished by a fine; again, in the summer, for drill; and in the autumn by regiments or brigades, at what was called general muster, for review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1223"/>This last was a great occasion, in which all the high officials of the military, with their glittering uniforms, and frequently the governor, paraded in all their glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1224"/>The plain in the easterly part of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, now covered with streets and houses, was frequently the muster-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1225"/>Such a company existed in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName> as early as <dateStruct value="1781--"><year reg="1781">1781</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1226"/>Until <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct> this company belonged to the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">First Brigade</orgName>, and <orgName type="division" n="Division 3">Third Division</orgName>; then a new regiment was formed, the <num value="5" type="ordinal">Fifth</num>, and the company was transferred to it, and from that time I believe that every company formed in <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, with possibly the exception of <num value="1">one</num> of those raised during the war, has formed a part of the same <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 5">Fifth Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1227"/>I would also except the <orgName type="mil" key="IndependentCompany">Independent Company</orgName> organized under the same law of <dateStruct value="1785--"><year reg="1785">1785</year></dateStruct>, and <pb id="p.85" n="85"/> with the same standing and liberties as the <rs>Boston</rs> and the <rs>Salem Cadets</rs>, belonging to no regiment and having the right of the line at reviews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1228"/>This company resigned its charter in <dateStruct value="1828--"><year reg="1828">1828</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1229"/>You all know the little brick powder-house standing near the top of the hill, just above the house of <persName n="Sise,Mister,A.,F.,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01028" reg="default:Sise,A.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Sise</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1230"/>Within my recollection it was used for the storage of powder and was protected by a lightning-rod.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1231"/>During the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> the company last mentioned kept guard over it for some weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1232"/>Upon the dissolution of this company the members were, under the existing law, enrolled in the militia company under the command of <persName n="Sparrell,Captain,John,,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01029" reg="default:Sparrell,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Sparrell</surname></persName>, whom some of my elder hearers may remember, and who appeared at the muster that autumn at the head of a company of <num value="196">one hundred and ninety-six</num> rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1233"/><placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>, I think, has never mustered so large a company since, for the duty was considered irksome and was evaded when possible.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1234"/>This company was succeeded by the <rs type="place">Brooks</rs> Phalanx in <dateStruct value="1841--"><year reg="1841">1841</year></dateStruct>, which was dissolved in <dateStruct value="1849--"><year reg="1849">1849</year></dateStruct>, and was succeeded by the <rs>Lawrence</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="LightGuard">Light Guard</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1235"/>This company was well organized and in a good state of discipline at the time of the breaking out of the war of the <rs>Rebellion</rs>, in which, under its commander, <persName n="Hutchins,Captain,John,,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01030" reg="default:Hutchins,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Hutchins</surname></persName>, it took an active part; but the period at which its brave and patriotic services were performed covers a later date than that assigned to me to record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1236"/>I can only say that their valor, their devotion, the patience and the courage with which they underwent the hardships and encountered the dangers of the war, were beyond all praise, and will ever be held in grateful remembrance by their townsmen and their country.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1237"/>I have spoken of <persName n="Brooks,Governor,,,," id="n0334.0022.00085.01031" reg="nearbymention:Brooks,Alexander,Scammell,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Brooks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1238"/>It was once my good fortune to see him. In <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>, when he was governor and the district (now State) of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName> was a part of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, he came down among us to attend, in his capacity of commander-in-chief, the annual militia musters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1239"/>My father then lived at <placeName key="tgn,7013556" n="1.000 9" reg="castine, hancock, maine">Castine</placeName>, <pb id="p.86" n="86"/> and the muster-field was about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1240"/>He took me, then a lad of hardly <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, with him, and we walked to the muster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1241"/>He pointed out to me the governor as he galloped across the field at full speed&mdash;alone&mdash;to rectify some irregularity, upon a black horse, wearing a <num value="3">three</num>-cornered cocked hat, and a powdered cue hanging down his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1242"/>So much for the military history of <placeName reg="Medford, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014023">Medford</placeName>.</p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1243"/>The next matter of special interest in the history of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of the century relates to theological and parochial affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1244"/>All religious and parochial matters were the affair of the <rs>State</rs> and the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1245"/>Until <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct> the law required every citizen to pay his portion of the expense of maintaining public worship according to his ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1246"/>So long as there was but <num value="1">one</num> religious society in the town, the town and the parish were <num value="1">one</num>&mdash;there was no distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1247"/>The town at its annual meetings voted the appropriations for the minister's salary and the other expenses for support of public worship, and every man was taxed for this purpose according to his means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1248"/>Religion was an affair of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1249"/>The prevailing doctrine of the churches was the old orthodox Calvinistic creed, but in the early part of the century, perhaps about <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, this doctrine began to be held with a certain laxity of interpretation by many of the people and not a few of the ministers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1250"/>Those who wavered were frequently styled <hi rend="italics">Arminians</hi>, which seemed to indicate a rejection of the stricter doctrines of predestination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1251"/>The change was gradual, and at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> almost imperceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1252"/>Some of the older ministers were observed to dwell less in their sermons upon the <num value="5">five</num> points of Calvinism and more upon religion as a <hi rend="italics">life</hi> rather than a mode of belief, and a greater liberality of thought was allowed.
